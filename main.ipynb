    "## **Project One: TripAdvisor Recommendation Challenge - Beating BM25**\n",
    "_**Authors:** Alberto MARTINELLI, Alessia SARRITZU_\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to develop a recommendation system that relies solely on user reviews to suggest similar places based on given queries. The system will propose the most relevant location based on the text of the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data pre-processing**:\n",
    "  - Utilise only the reviews where ratings are composed strictly with this aspects: **service**, **cleanliness**, **overall**, **value**, **location**, **sleep quality**, and **rooms**.\n",
    "  - Concatenate reviews by `offering_id` to compute average ratings for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **BM25 Implementation**:\n",
    "    - Implement a BM25 baseline using the **Rank-BM25** library.\n",
    "    - Measure the performance of BM25 through Mean Square Error (MSE) between each ratings of the query place and the recommended place.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Unsupervised Model**:\n",
    "    - Create a new unsupervised model to outperform BM25, potentially integrating it with other methods, while ensuring the model does not directly utilize ratings in its learning process.\n",
    "    - Measure performance of the **Enhanced Model** through Mean Square Error (MSE) between the ratings of the query place and the recommended place, with the aim of achieving a lower MSE than the BM25 baseline."

      "I visited NYC for the first time the last week of March with my son, daughter-in-law, 14 year old grandson & 12 year old granddaughter. We had a junior suite with 2 queen beds & a full size hidebed. I was worried the 5 of us would be stumbling all over each other in one room, but it was perfect, much larger than I expected. Anything we asked for, more towels, more coffee, a bellman when we left , etc. was supplied within 5 minutes. The location was great. We walked to St. Patrick's, TIme Square, Grand Central Terminal, & more. Also it was very convenient to the subway. I would highly recommend this hotel to families and if I ever visit NYC again, I'll stay at Affinia 50.\n"
