    "## **Project One: TripAdvisor Recommendation Challenge - Beating BM25**\n",
    "_**Authors:** Alberto MARTINELLI, Alessia SARRITZU_\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to develop a recommendation system that relies solely on user reviews to suggest similar places based on given queries. The system will propose the most relevant location based on the text of the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data pre-processing**:\n",
    "  - Utilise only the reviews where ratings are composed strictly with this aspects: **service**, **cleanliness**, **overall**, **value**, **location**, **sleep quality**, and **rooms**.\n",
    "  - Concatenate reviews by `offering_id` to compute average ratings for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **BM25 Implementation**:\n",
    "    - Implement a BM25 baseline using the **Rank-BM25** library.\n",
    "    - Measure the performance of BM25 through Mean Square Error (MSE) between each ratings of the query place and the recommended place.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Unsupervised Model**:\n",
    "    - Create a new unsupervised model to outperform BM25, potentially integrating it with other methods, while ensuring the model does not directly utilize ratings in its learning process.\n",
    "    - Measure performance of the **Enhanced Model** through Mean Square Error (MSE) between the ratings of the query place and the recommended place, with the aim of achieving a lower MSE than the BM25 baseline."

      "The hotel is on 4th Street, two blocks from the fame 6th Street. Our room faced 7th street and we heard the festivites until 2am. The room is nice and clean. But that noise was a big issue. Also the parking garage is tight and not truck/SUV friendly. If you are coming to Austin to party then this is a good hotel to stay in, but if you are coming to relax, you will not be able to till after 2am. The room was well-appointed and looks new- the carpet, the sheets, curtains and the rest of the furniture and fixture. I was actually surprised as the pictures on their site feature old style sheets, carpet and furniture pieces. I guess they updated their rooms recently to make it a little hip. Also the room was clean and the bathroom toilet, curtains, sink, vanity - were all clean. I loved the room and look forward to our stay. We checked in from Nov. 16- 20,2012. The only thing disappointing was we were given the third floor room which is but on the same level as that of their a/c units, not to mention that if you want to let light through the room by parting the curtains, you see your next door neighbors from the other units. So we just let the curtains cover the \"view.\" We asked for a higher floor, but since it was the week of the F1 race, all the rooms were fully booked. Around 3:00 am of the 18th, there was a little noise I heard from outside, which made me woke up. I saw that there was some light going through the window so I managed to adjust the curtain and by chance, as I am pulling the curtains, I saw one of the guests' window was cracked fully opened. I was thinking, were they smoking in their room or were they hanging outside by the a/c units? This was not good. The as I was trying to fix the curtain and so as not to compromise our privacy, a woman popped out of the open window and probably saw me and I can see her forming an obscene f- word at me! That was unacceptable at all! I am going to report this to the front desk when we check-out. Also, the when people are passing by the hallway, you could clearly hear what they are talking about. It would had been perfect if not for this, the incident and the view... Friendly staff and a nice location. Prices spiked during the F1 weekend, so I can't say it was a good value. But easy walking distance to everything downtown - and very quiet! Rooms are pretty standard for a business hotel.\n",
      "There is a Starbucks and a Champions in the lobby - which is very convenient for coffee and/or a quick bite to eat. I stayed between Oct 31-Nov 4th. \n",
      "This hotel is perfect for your next trip to Austin whether it's business or pleasure. The hotel is located right across the street from the Convention Center. 2 Blocks from non stop entertainment of 6th Street and near many resturants. The staff was very professional. The room was nice, no complaints. Starbucks and Champions Resturant were located witihn the hotel, no issues with either one. If you're looking for a nice place to stay in Austin, this is the one. My son and I stayed here during Austin Comic Con due mainly to the location. The hotel is directly across the street from the Convention center and in the middle of downtown, so the location is ideal.\n",
      "The rooms are clean and comfortable, but nothing extra ordinary. The housekeeping was very late in the afternoon, so plan on that. We wanted to rest during the afternoon after spending the morning at the convention center, but left when housekeeping arrived. Water pressure and hot water were fine.\n",
      "We tried the local hotel restaurant the first night (Champions) and it was average. They have a nice bar with TVs, so it would make a good spot to drink and watch a game, but not for food. Luckily there are a ton of restaurants downtown, so you have a lot of choices for lunch and dinner. As for breakfast, there is a Starbucks attached to the hotel, so we had coffee and breakfast sandwiches there. My stay at the Courtyard was quite nice. The location right in downtown Austin was just right for my business trip. Lots of dining choices nearby. Hotel service was great. There is a good amount of construction in downtown Austin right now, but you could still get around on-foot easily. This is a standard Courtyard except for the fact it adjoins a Residence Inn. The fitness center is located on the Residence Inn side and the Residence Inn side provides complimentary afternoon cookies for their guests. The Courtyard just has flavored water or coffee in for their guests. The Courtyard had some evening music in the lobby, a guitarist one night. That was fine, but it would be nice if they provided a manager's reception. (I was there two nights mid-week.) This was a fairly typical Courtyard, which has come to mean updated, somewhat stylish, convenient, courteous, and well appointed. For a business class hotel, the better Courtyards are tough to beat, and this one is probably at the high-end of it's peers. \n",
      "Located in the same building and immediately adjacent to a Residence Inn, the two properties are able to share each other's amenities. For example, they share a fitness center/pool/whirlpool area, which was one of the best I've seen in this class of hotel. The room was huge and featured up-to-date and functional equipment. Five treadmills, two recumbent bikes, three ellipticals, plus a full set of dumbbells and several weight machines. \n",
      "The lobby was typical of an updated Courtyard, with their bistro serving coffee and food. However, this location is enhanced by having a full-scale Starbucks in the building as well as a Champions sports bar. \n",
      "The staff was courteous and had the air of the staff at a premium hotel. \n",
      "Parking might be tough, so plan on probably valeting your vehicle. Very friendly and helpful staff!! Checked in with no problems, and the room was spacious and well laid out.\n",
      "I was teaching a class in this location and all the staff that I encountered were wonderful. They opened the room for me the afternoon before the class so I could get set up. All of my materials made it and were in the room waiting for me. We had breakfast and lunch during the class. The Breakfast was AWESOME!! Lunch was sandwiches however they were very tasty. \n",
      "All in all, the property was what you'd expect of a Marriott Courtyard - quality!! A little on the expensive side, but worth it in the long run. I would stay here again!! I’ve stayed here a couple times and it’s incredibly convenient for attending trade shows; just across the street from the ACC. It is also very convenient for walking almost anywhere downtown including the great bars on 6th street which are packed Thursday-Sunday nights. The prices are average for most Courtyards and I would stay here again. Clean, great location and nice decor. The staff provided superior service and got us checked in well before the standard check in time. We flew into Austin for the ACL Festival and although it was a very busy weekend, the staff made sure to make us feel special. They stowed our bags until the room was ready, called us when the room became ready and gave us free Starbucks coupons for the shop attached to the hotel. We were able to walk around and investigate Austin. Would stay there again. Stayed here during a conference that was being held at the Convention Center. \n",
      "Surprises: \n",
      "valet parking - usually don't have that at Courtyards\n",
      "Residence inn was attached. Two hotels were combined into one\n",
      "Champions - seems these are usually associated with Marriotts, not the Courtyards.\n",
      "I stayed for 4 nights - very quiet and uneventful. It was nice to have a full restaurant in the building although I thought it was lame that the bar closed at 12am when the entire town is open to at least 2am.\n",
      "The room was clean and seemed as if it was recently updated - looks the same as other \"updated\" rooms through the chain.\n",
      "Service was fine - nothing over the top but it was solid. \n",
      "Food from the restaurant was pretty good - I had a burger and it was tasty. They've got a few local beers on tap which was nice. Also had breakfast (buffet) one time in the restaurant and it fine for a buffet.\n",
      "Best part was that this hotel is literally a few steps away from the Convention Center - totally convenient. If I ever attend a conference in Austin again I'll definitely have this hotel at the top of the list. I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for a quick visit to Austin. The room price was reasonable <($200) and I was staying with a friend so that helped hedge the cost. We pulled our car up and valeted our vehicle since finding parking isn't the easiest thing to do in the area. Upon entering the lobby, you are greetted by a really helpful staff, individuals who actually care that you have a fun time staying in the hotel. It was a nice touch.\n",
      "The room I stayed in was a double with a pull out couch. The room was quite roomy and above all, clean! The bathroom was clean with ample amounts of towels. The bed sheets were clean and fresh. It was exactly what I wanted with my room and could not have asked for more.\n",
      "The location is very convenient, right on 4th street and a two blocks away from 6th street and Red River St. Going out, which was a priority for my group, was super easy and made the trip that much more enjoyable. If you are going to Austin and want to be near the action this is a great hotel. Two blocks from 6th street, close to I35, next to convention center, capitol and close to UT. \n",
      "This Courtyard is a bit upgraded from the typical Courtyard in some ways. The onsite restaurant has room service, and there is a full service Starbucks on site. Really nice lobby with Texas style decor. Housekeeping left cute towel origami. Extras gave the place a nice feel. \n",
      "We had a one king room. Included sofa bed and large work space. Did NOT include a mini-fridge or microwave, but other rooms at this hotel did include them. Make sure to ask if this is important to you. We were in a room directly above the hotel entrance- never heard a vehicle because sound proof windows worked well. Bed was of average comfort, linens and pillows were all in good repair and seemed relatively new. \n",
      "Two minor issues that keep me from giving a higher rating. The blackout curtains worked great, but there was a vent over the door to the hallway that let the light in from the hallway. Very odd, but I suspect that was probably a building code issue or something. My husband is sensitive to light when sleeping and that was bothersome for him. \n",
      "Second, I was disappointed with housekeeping. We were in our room getting ready so put out the do not disturb sign. When we were leaving at 12:30, we found a note from housekeeping saying that they have \"honored our request\" for no service and to contact front desk if we wanted service. Really? At 12:30 in the afternoon they were not going to come back and check? We took the note to the front desk and assured them we DID want service. The front desk clerk gave us an odd look as if she'd never seen one of these before. We did receive service, but our door was not fully latched when we returned and this had deactivated our room keys. \n",
      "Overall, a very good stay with a few minor annoyances. Would recommend. First of all, this hotel is in a great location. It is two blocks from sixth street so very easy to walk to all the booze and music. It also has a Starbucks and sports bar on the premises which is handy. The real issue was with the room. It is really just the most average thing you could think of. The bed was average, the furniture was average, the wifi connection was average etc. The bathroom was poor. No light over the toilet and shower, very uncomfortable towels and really cheap soap and shampoo. The hotel was quiet which is nice for sleeping. Really nice hotel. I flew in with my 5-year-old for the Lego Kidsfest across the street at the convention center. Location was perfect for us - plus easy to walk to the bat bridge and even the restaurants across the river. Taxi to/from the airport was $25 or so - made much more sense than renting a car and paying to park at the hotel. Check-in was fast, the room was nice (newly rennovated?) and beds were good. The showerhead was stuck in an uncomfortable jet spray and couldn't be changed, and there was no refirigerator in the room which meant that our dinner leftovers went to waste, but those are my only minor complaints. Would definitely stay here again. Facility sits in good location. I was able to walk to State Capitol, Congress St. Bridge, Sixth St. all within 20 minutes. Hotel was clean and fresh. Only gripe is self parking is $21. View was overlooking an alley filled with dumpsters, but it is a city, so its part of the territory. Would stay again. We stayed here 2 nights last week and had a great time. I think our room was newly refurbished as it was in good shape and I was delighted to have generous portions of coffee for the machine as this is usually something we always need more of during our stay. My only concern was the lack of safe in the room. We went to Schlitterbahn, the water park, for the day and left watches, rings etc in the room and I would have felt better if we could have secured them. This is what brings it down from excellent to very good. As everyone else has mentioned the hotel is really in an exceptional location\n",
      "PS Felt mean so putting it up to excellent - wish this had half stars! Great location within walking distance to lots of restaurants, etc. Clean rooms that are like new. The only things the room didn't have was a refrigerator and microwave. Great breakfast, and sports bar. We got a great rate through Priceline. It is convenient to a lot of restaurants and everything that is happening downtown. I am annoyed at having to pay $25 everyday to park. But it is a city and parking is a luxury. We were disappointed by the restaurant in the hotel. The food was mediocre and the service was nasty. I have been extremely disappointed with my stay at this hotel (May 2012). The hotel is undergoing renovations -- the pool and fitness center are closed (and the \"alternates\" in other buildings have limited hours), I was awoken this morning by loud drilling, and the rooms smell of paint. I was disappointed that they did not notify me of these plans at the time of my booking, but instead sent me an email a couple days before my trip, when all of the other nearby hotels were already booked up. Also, the rooms are not very nice -- I can hear it very loudly whenever the people in the room next door run the water in the bathroom or, god forbid, flush the toilet -- this kept me up quite a bit at night! The alarm clock also woke me up early my first night here because the cleaning staff did not reset it from the previous occupant. Additionally, when I asked the front desk staff for information about nearby restaurants they were not very helpful. Great hotel and staff!! Found a charge for $28 for something I already paid for. Not resolved. very convenient, great bed but noisy neighbors. it seemed as though their noise was being piped into our room through vents. As soon as we called the front desk they were quieted. Thanks! My 2Q corner room, 6th floor, was spacious, quiet, well maintained, with a nice view, free wifi in the room and lobby, free coffee in the room and lobby, reasonably priced breakeast buffets at Champions, Convention Center is across the street and nearby downtown restaurants include Ironworks for great bbq and La Traviata for excellent Italian. Bus stops on corner at Trinity or 3 blocks on Congress. Stayed during SXSW Festival.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "* Located across from convention center and within walking distance to all parts of SXSW.\n",
      "* Comfortable beds and pillows.\n",
      "* Working A/C (although I had a hard time finding how to turn it off - light switch behind the drapes did the trick)\n",
      "* Good shower\n",
      "* Full restaurant and Starbucks on site\n",
      "* Parking garage underground\n",
      "* Computer with internet in lounge area\n",
      "* Friendly valet guys\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "* Charge for parking\n",
      "* Unable to park trailer due to underground lot, but we knew this beforehand (it is stated on their website); We found a lot near the capitol and he gave us a discounted rate (charged for only two spaces, although we took up more) and he allowed us to leave it overnight, although the lot was only open until 3 AM. \n",
      "* Inflated rates during SXSW This hotel is unique in that it is attached to another Marriott property. The location is very convenient for downtown Austin. It is walking distance to 6th Street. The valet staff and front desk staff are friendly and efficient. The hotel and room are clean and modern. There is a nice bar in the hotel and a Starbucks near the entrance. The room was quiet and comfortable. We will definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to others. The rooms at the Courtyard are nice, and the close proximity to the Convention Center (about a block) makes the walk bearable even in uncomfortable weather. Parking is excessively expensive. Champions, the hotel bar, is a good place to enjoy a drink and unwind. They have a good selection of beer on tap. Stayed here for a business meeting. Great location. Close to a lot of bars and restaurants. Very nice rooms, excellent front desk people. The bar was nice and attached to the hotel. Loved the location and I would definitely stay there again. Stayed here for a weekend for a University of Texas Football game. Booked early so i got a good rate and the hotel was really nice. Breakfast was included that was a nice perk. rooms where clean and hotel was quite. quick walk to 6th street and the campus. would go back in a heart beat. Stayed here for the Game Developer Conference Online event which was next door at the Austin Convention Centre.\n",
      "The good thing about the hotel is that even though the convention centre had two events going on, it was nice and quiet in the hotel. Only the awesome lobby Starbucks was full in the mornings. The hotels' Champions sports restaurant is actually pretty good too even if the buffet breakfast is rather standard fare, it's okay for the price and has the usual stuff you'd expect. The restaurant is also spacious and has a small patio, so there's always space available.\n",
      "I have to say the hotel's service was really friendly and not intrusive. I'm European, I dont need to be asked how I'm doing every time I walk by! :) Both the staff at the reception desk and at the door, were friendly and very helpful.\n",
      "The room is your usual Courtyard room. Bed was comfy, bathroom big and definitely had enough space for one's toiletries and lots of towels.It was also really quiet and the free wifi was very fast for being free. The gym had lots of exercise bikes and felt like a real gym, not a small hotel crammed full of a few exercise machines. There's also a pool behind the gym.\n",
      "The hotel's location is superb. 6th street which has all the bars and restaraunt's is two blocks away and well, a block away to any direction, you had some great restaurants. I recommend the Downtown burger joint across the street from the hotel's main entrance.\n",
      "Would definitely stay here again. It's a franchise, but a high-quality one, feels comfortable and efficient and is not super-expensive, even if I find it strange I pay almost more in Austin, than in bigger US cities. I recently spent two nights at the Courtyard Austin Downtown. The location cannot be beat. You are walking distance from the hub of Austin (6th Street). Also, downstairs there is a full service Starbucks and Sports Restaurant (Champions). The room was the perfect size for my stay and noise was not an issue even though it was a football game weekend. What stood out the most was the customer service. The staff went above and beyond. I left my phone charger at home and was expecting an important call. Even though it was after midnight, Carlos at the front desk searched high and low until he found the phone charger I needed. Thanks Carlos! Then, on my day of departure my car battery had died. During the busy check-out period, Trevor at the Valet desk provided his valuable time and assistance to make sure my car battery was recharged and that I was on my way. Thanks Trevor! I know that whenever I'm in Austin I will definitely stay at this property not only for its location, but also for its awesome customer service. I spent one night here on a business trip that had me visiting a number of cities in Texas. This is a unique Marriott property in that it is a joint Courtyard/Residence Inn that shares a building and facilities while maintaining a separate check-in for the respective brand.\n",
      "Now I would recommend venturing out in Austin, especially being so close to Sixth Street; however, this hotel has it all if you want to stay in. From the large and well-stocked Champions Sports Bar to the Starbucks both on the lobby level, the hotel can meet all dining needs.\n",
      "At check-in, my Gold Status was acknowledged and i was given a room on a high floor. I would have liked a nicer view, but thats not a big deal.\n",
      "I found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating.\n",
      "Only a few negatives, and largely related to price. The room rates are generally high here - I consider upwards of $200 for a Courtyard to be quite high and pay parking on top of that took the total cost for one night upwards of $225. But as I said, you get what you pay for and here it is location, service and clean accommodations. We stayed at this location for one night while visiting Austin. We wanted to be near the nightlife and entertainment so chose this location. \n",
      "The location was easy to find and the hotel is in a commercial area between 6th street entertainment and the convention center and a 5 minute walk to all the action in the warehouse district as well. You have the choice of valet or self-parking. Self-parking is in a connected garage with easy elevator access. ($21 self with in and out) There is a nicely decorated inviting lobby with front desk and nicely appointed common area. Across the elevator bank is the Residence Inn, which shares a common building. There is free Wi-Fi available in the lobby area and rooms. The hotel has a large, nicely appointed gym. There is small indoor pool, but unfortunately no outside deck space. We did not get the opportunity to check on a business center. Check in was quick and efficient, and they did an excellent job of noting our request for a quiet room (away from the 6th street noise) and put us in a room facing 4th street on a high floor. \n",
      "Though we were there for the nightlife of Austin, it was nice to be away from the hectic side, and we were really appreciative of the hotels strong stance on no noise. They have prominent signs stating no parties are allowed, and that only registered guests are allowed at the hotel. When we came back to the hotel Saturday evening, they had security at the door to ensure that only guests were allowed in. This is a nice touch.\n",
      "The rooms are nicely decorated, relatively large and still seem new. The beds are comfortable and they have nice HD TV's and plenty of channels. The climate control works well and the blower motor stays on for white noise while the climate control is still functioning. We had no noise from adjoining rooms nor outside city noise. Bathrooms are well equipped with plenty of storage space. There is a tub with shower We could hear doors slamming in the morning from time to time. \n",
      "Though the adjoining Residence Inn includes breakfast, the Courtyard by Marriott does not. This is the norm for the brand and we did not expect any free breakfast. The area has every type of dining and entertainment option you could ask for all within easy walking distance. We did not partake of any of the hotels dining venues.....too many good choices nearby to eat in a hotel. \n",
      "We would absolutely recommend this location and would stay here again if we wanted to stay in the area for a personal trip. Room rate seemed appropriate for the area, especially with our AAA discount. Having also stayed at the nearby Hilton and Intercontinental hotels in the past, I would feel comfortable choosing any of these hotels based on who has the best price at the time. All of these are very nice options and similar in their offerings and the prices seem to vary wildly from day to day. They were agreeable to late check-out when we asked which was nice. The entire hotel is non-smoking which is always a plus. I've stayed at this property about 40 times in the last 2 years, so clearly I'm finding it to be an excellent location. I'm always greeted by warm and friendly front desk staff, always find a spotlessly clean room, and always have a pleasant stay. Over the course of many visits, the staff has been most helpful with a wide array of issues, from me leaving behind personal items in my room, losing my room key, loaning a phone charger, recommending places to eat and drink, and so much more. Free wifi internet is good, but can slow a bit in evening hours. Gym is good, with 4 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, some weight machines, free weights, TVs, and a small pool. This property fills up early with conventions (teacher/education conferences all summer long) and festivals (SXSW & ACL), so book early if you can. Champions sports bar downstairs is nothing special in the way of food (think:Applebee's), but the beer is cold and there is sports playing on a screen covering nearly every wall and surface. Starbucks downstairs is also a big plus. Location is 2 blocks from the heart of 6th street, and there's probably 40-50 restaurants & pubs within a 6 block radius that are really good - yes, I've tried most of them at least once. I can't really speak as to the value this place has as I get a corporate rate for $119. I imagine the conventions book special rates as well, but the \"normal\" rate of $269 sounds steep.\n",
      "The one - and only - problem I ever had with the hotel itself was that my rental car was stolen out of the self park section of the underground garage. There are no security cameras down there apparently. Hotel staff told me this had never happened before and was as helpful as they could be about it (which is more than I can say for Hertz or Austin PD). It hasn't deterred me from staying or parking there since then; I'm just more careful now to check and see if the rental agency has left a spare hidden key in the glove box!\n",
      "All in all, a nice property with a top 5 in the world staff. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Courtyard for ACL weekend. We were able to check in early around noon and head over to the festival-Thumbs up! Rooms were great and our housekeeping was amazing! We were actually impressed at the little things she replaced-Thumps up! We decided to park in the garage for $21 a night because it was a safe place and convenient. The only issue we had here was that after a late night breakfast at Kerby Lane we returned and no parking was available...fully booked. Tired and a little annoyed (since we are paying $21 for a parking spot) I called the front desk from the garage to let them know of the situation. They were extremely nice and said to bring it to valet. We brought it up to valet and explained to the guy what we were told. He was very short and said to drive back down to the garage and take a valet spot. We explained that we were told to bring it up and again said to just park anywhere....no apology and never took our car. My boyfriend drove it back around and parked in valet-Thumbs Down! I never complained because i was too tired. All in All it is a great hotel in a great location. Oh and i read in other reviews that breakfast was now being served but we were told otherwise-Thumbs Down! Austin Java is a great place near by that they recommended. The Courtyard was fabulous. It was clean, convenient, spacious with a perfect location. The assistance we received at the front desk is similar to a fine upscale hotel. They recommended restaurants, places to go, things to do and most importantly helped us with our new iphones that we were not sure how to use. The staff is terrific. Love this hotel and highly recommend it for a visit to Austin. I stayed at the Courtyard in Downtown Austin last month for business. The hotel was packed; however, I was there for a convention, so I'd assume any time you are there for a convention it will be packed. The staff was friendly, my room was clean, and the hotel is litteraly across the street from the convention center! \n",
      "My only complaints, the walls were thin and the line at the Starbucks in the lobby was always long... at least a 30 minute wait. The hotel is a short cab ride from the airport ($21-$25 fare) and is in a great location near the convention center, 6th Street and Congress. The staff is very attentive from the doormen to the front desk. The facility was exceptionally clean and, during midweek, quiet. I had a single king bed and for a standard room, it was spacious. There was a love seat and desk.\n",
      "I stayed the week prior to SXSW. My single king bed during midweek was $159/night but jumped to $459 during SXSW.\n",
      "My expectations were exceeded and would recommend this hotel. It has every aspect important to me: location, cleanliness, quietness, attentive staff.\n",
      "I did not have a car but the parking rate of $21/day seems excessive. The ladies went above and beyond and helped me get a wonderful outfit together for New Years. They are a positive crew and really really made my hotel experience fabulous.\n",
      "Thanks Girls; I haven't forgotten you all : )\n",
      "Also, I had a great quiet room : ) Stayed at the Courtyard Marriot for a conference, just across the street from the convention center. Staff were extremely friendly (but maybe that's all of Austin!) and very accommodating. Business center with computers and free printing was very convenient. Rooms were extremely comfortable and quiet. The fitness center was well-equipped. There is a pool, but it's pretty small (as most hotel pools are).\n",
      "The only improvement I would suggest is better in-room internet! The wireless access in the rooms was spotty and slow, but even the wired connection didn't offer much improvement.\n",
      "Otherwise, had a great stay. Thank you! Stayed 1-5 July.\n",
      "Volleyball tourney was there = young, tall teenagers everywhere!\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Comfy beds, very clean, nice Marriott, STARBUCKS! Great service from BJ at the front desk who compensated for misinformation when I called the front desk asking for a fridge in advance. Location!!!\n",
      "Cons: Loud! Near 6th street so you can hear the DJ from your room. SMALL pool and whirlpool! Too small! Front desk told me I'd have to check-in before I could get on a list for a fridge. I called hours in advance and SHOULD have gotten one but she misinformed me. BJ was great, apologized, and comped us, so he made up for her lousy service. Parking is 21/27 a day, self/valet. Boo. I stayed at the Courtyard on 5/12-5/13, and could not have been more pleased with my stay. I had business meetings throughout the first day in Austin, and late that afternoon, I found myself scrambling for a place to hold another meeting the following day. The evening staff made all the arrangements for me to use one of their conference rooms at no cost to me or my client, and the morning staff came through with flying colors. They even made arrangements to ship all of my boxes back to my office in Atlanta. I would unequivocally recommend this hotel. I was fortunate enough to experience this hotel during Austin's South by Southwest music festival. I was AMAZED at the friendliness of the front desk and all other employees I came into contact with. Having had the opportunity to experience SXSW the two previous years (both at different major downtown hotels), I will absolutely spend next year at this hotel. From directions to special requests to just plain friendly service, I truly loved my entire stay here. The beds were extraordinarily comfortable, the workout room far better than what I expected, and Champions Sports Bar with Starbucks were both outstanding amenities. I was always entertained. I commend the management there for their ability to recognize superior talent in staffing and encourage them to continue what they're doing. It was the best stay in any hotel I've ever had! I stayed here two nights. When I arrived, late in the evening, there were a slew of cars in the drive and there was only fellow handing out tickets for valet parking, but it moved smoothly enough. Check-in was a whiz and the receptionists were helpful. \n",
      "I had a nice room overlooking the Frost Bank building, with a kitchenette and sitting area. Everything worked and it was spotless. The clock radio was sort of cheezy though and had poor reception.\n",
      "The buffet breakfast, included in the rate, was really one of the best I've ever had -- everything from oatmeal to eggs, to waffles and patries, cereals, toast....etc. And throughout the hotel the staff was helpful and friendly. \n",
      "The Champions restaurant onsite has an uninspired menu but the food was fresh and good tasting (no 'healthful' choices really). Eddie V's, a fantastic seafood restaurant, is around the corner. \n",
      "Skip the valet parking and do self-parking in the garage to save $6/night. The first night I did valet parking. I called for my car so I could self park it for the next night. When I pulled into the garage, the machine that deploys tickets said 'lot full'. I called the front desk from my cell, and right away, a fellow came down to let me in, and comp'd my parking for the night for the trouble. That was really nice.\n",
      "I checked out the fitness center although I didn't have time to use it...far above the norm I think. A small but long pool for indoor laps. My Husband and I made reservations for a weekend get-away. When we arrived at the hotel the front desk staff told us that they did not have a king room (the one we reserved) available and that we had the choice of staying in a king handicap room or a queen double, then we could move rooms the next day. We took the queen double, the next morning when we went to our new room we discovered that it was a handicap room. So finally after carting our luggage back down to the front desk we were given keys to a new king room without even an apology. The Courtyard is in a good location - you can walk to restaurants and clubs and even to businesses. The hotel itself is clean and well functioning. Rooms are a bit small but not for a city hotel. Restaurant is well run and food is pretty good.\n",
      "Staff was very nice and helpful. Lobby area is a bit tight as is the parking garage.\n",
      "Only reall knock is the pool and fitness area - you have to walk a very convoluted path to get there and its a bit disappointing once you do.\n",
      "I would definately stay there again when in Austin. Was very impressed. Nice room, nice lobby, excellent location, reasonable price. Utilize convention center parking garages for a less expensive parking option. I liked this hotel, it wasent life changing but Marriots are pretty reliable. I would say for the price you pay the rooms are on the small side. And if you are expecting any extras in your room you will be dissapointed. But the location is great and the valet and check in was fast. All the hotels in the area are priced the same. So next time I might try something new. I try to stay at Marriots becasue Im a rewards member. I stayed here for two nights over the New Year weekend. The hotel staff were clearly unprepared to deal with the situation that weekend. My first mistake was valet parking the car. The staff in valet parking NEVER responded to telephone calls requesting the vehicle. When I went down in person to get the car, I waited about 20 minutes. This happened twice. New Years eve night, I was locked out of my room. Door mechanism did not recognize my key and it took them an hour to get me into my room. I had to be monitoring and following up every few minutes. One staff would tell another to take take of the problem. Of course, it wasn't and I was neglected. This is unacceptable. I'm a Marriott Rewards member and have stayed at many of their properties in three countries. Until now, it has been very good. This experience, however, has soured me on Marriott. We were here for a night last week. The hotel is located right in the middle of downtown Austin, which is an absolute positive. We had a high floor room with wonderful views of the city. Walked to Cafe Crepe for breakfast the next morning. Another great plus- there's a Starbucks in the lobby...And plenty of paid parking in the garage downstairs. Couldn't ask for more on a stopover. I stayed here one night on business. The lobby and hallways had a very strong sewage smell, which the staff said was coming from work being done up the street, but it was terrible and strong. Luckily it did not smell in my room. The room was clean but in need of updating. The view from my room was of a dirty alley full of trash cans. As a Marriott rewards member, I would have expected to be booked on a floor/side with a better view. I must say this is the first time I have been disappointed with a Marriott property. On the plus side the breakfast, staff and service were all outstanding. This place has plenty of good reasons for making it a top choice in Austin hotels. The location is perfect for anything downtown. The staff was eager to please and help with any request. Parking at $27 a day is annoying, but the room value was good. Spacious, clean and updated rooms were reasonably priced and had great skyline views. The leisure or business traveler will appreciate the comfortable rooms and the attached Starbucks was a nice bonus for late nighters. \n",
      "In room coffee was bad, so Marriott may want to rethink that choice. It was my only disappointment here, so that is pretty high recommendation. Most downtown things were easy walking. Shopping, restaurants, nightlife all were convenient. Our late night cab was only $5. \n",
      "Overall this was a perfect location and will be a top Austin choice for future trips. Nothing but good things to say about this hotel. From the check in process to checkout it was perfect. The room was very clean and modern and great for both sleep and work. The location is great and very central to most of the things you need to do. I enjoyed the full Starbucks located right off the lobby . \n",
      "This is a hotel I would recommend without reservations. Known quantity of Courtyard hotel --- very good facilities, everything in great shape --- and close to Convention Center, 6th Street and much of downtown. Only minus is in-house Starbuck's shutting too early (6-8PM?), but alternatives are easily found within a couple of blocks. I stayed here 1 night for business(stayed here 2 years ago too) and this is an excellent location and set up. A Starbucks downstairs, a decent fitness facility next door at the Residence Inn \n",
      "( properties are connected ) along with a a small bar in the lobby (open only at night for a limted time) Laundry facilities too and in-room dining provided by a pub next door. The location is good for downtown and right next to the convention center. The real plus are all of the great restaurants and bars ( many with live music) all within walking distance. Nothing fancy, really clean and well run- and fairly priced! We stayed there the week of June 19. Across the street from the convention center & very close to 6th street, where all the club action is, as well as most restaurants. Incredibly clean & beautiful rooms & lobby. Great, very accomodating staff. Highly recommed. self parking however, was terrible. Its garage fills up very quickly, especially late night, with the staff double-parking the Valet spots. But when that happens, theey will Valet the car for no additional fee. Not a great negative, however. I am a loyal Marriott customer, and this location rivals some of the best anywhere. This hotel was not unique, and the only part of my stay that was surprising was the room’s layout (instead of facing the wall, the bed faced the window). All of this should be considered positive. There are hotels that specialize in certain experiences and themes, but this is simply a functional, well maintained place to rest and store luggage.\n",
      "The best aspect of this hotel is the value. This value is derived from a location within walking distance of many great sights and eateries, and 6th Street’s attractions as well. The price is usually very reasonable, unless there is a major event taking place in that area. This trip occurred during the ROT Rally, and I definitely appreciated being able to walk to the delicious food at the Bistro, but being a little further from the growling engines of the bikes that prowled the 6th Street strip.\n",
      "The staff was young and enthusiastic, and decently competent and speedy. There is complimentary wi-fi in the lobby, and I think in the rooms too. The property seems clean and well designed and it seems like a great place to stay for business or with the family. Good business location, but operated by a franchisee. thus no breakfast deal, newspaper, etc. Overall, a good stay, but pricey. Valet parking scratched fender and denied it.Prices vary tremendously when there is a football game or event. stayed here for spring graduation festivities for 2 nights. the room included a king bed, TV, mini-fridge that wasnt rigged with goodies or sensors, and a sofabed. the bathroom was spacious and updated. our room included a view of the light rail station just outside the hotel. \n",
      "this hotel is conveniently located close to 6th street bars, congress st., UT campus. they have an underground parking garage for guests ($21/night for self parking). another plus is they have security present at the door on thurs-sat nights to secure the hotel for guests and weed out any drunks from 6th street. \n",
      "overall, i enjoyed my stay as they provided all i could ask for from a hotel at an affordable price. they charged $269/night, but keep in mind all other hotels were $300+/night for graduation weekend. My friends and I stayed and this hotel in downtown Austin. This hotel is in a great location. You can walk everywhere. Upon check-in we had friendly faces and help. The hotel is under construction. I was not aware of that. I woke up Saturday morning to pounding and a lot of noise. That pretty much spoiled sleeping in. The hotel claims they e-mailed us but since we booked through Travelocity, we were out of luck. The hotel is nice. Once the construction is done it will be much better. Another bonus, Starbucks is attached to the property. Yay We stayed here May 2012 for the state track meet. It was very convenient -- walking-distance -- to 6th Street, which was a short 2 blocks away. It was also very convenient to the track stadium & other venues on the UT campus (driving distance). The hotel was very clean, staff was friendly & helpful, even offering us umbrellas for the drizzly walk to 6th St. Room was clean, had 2 queen beds, no safe, no fridge; hotel had some construction going on so perhaps those amenities will be added. The hotel access to the restaurant was cut off due to construction -- not sure if that will open back up or what the plan is. We accessed the restaurant from the street. Even though we were there on a Saturday night, noise from 6th Street was negliible, & access to the hotel lobby was restricted to guests only. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to visit Austin.\n"
