    "## **Project One: TripAdvisor Recommendation Challenge - Beating BM25**\n",
    "_**Authors:** Alberto MARTINELLI, Alessia SARRITZU_\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to develop a recommendation system that relies solely on user reviews to suggest similar places based on given queries. The system will propose the most relevant location based on the text of the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data pre-processing**:\n",
    "  - Utilise only the reviews where ratings are composed strictly with this aspects on reviews with ratings for the following aspects: **service**, **cleanliness**, **overall**, **value**, **location**, **sleep quality**, and **rooms**.\n",
    "  - Concatenate reviews by `offering_id` to compute average ratings for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **BM25 Implementation**:\n",
    "    - Implement a BM25 baseline using the **Rank-BM25** library.\n",
    "    - Measure the performance of BM25 through Mean Square Error (MSE) between each ratings of the query place and the recommended place.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Unsupervised Model**:\n",
    "    - Create a new unsupervised model to outperform BM25, potentially integrating it with other methods, while ensuring the model does not directly utilize ratings in its learning process.\n",
    "    - Measure performance of the **Enhanced Model** through Mean Square Error (MSE) between the ratings of the query place and the recommended place, with the aim of achieving a lower MSE than the BM25 baseline."

       "      <td>Started off pretty good, until I had a small problem. The television failed to work, so I called down to the office who said the maintenance would be back the next morning (Tuesday). As of Friday nothing had been fixed so I gave up on it. This led me to the other things in the room that might be a little bit of a put off. The curtains do not even cover half of the windows leaving the blinds to do all the work in the privacy department which were broken on one side.\\nPrivacy side apart there were other minor items that were a bit bothersome. Only one of the lamps worked, no remote to try the tv again, but the room next door had one...? The sound barrier between the rooms was atrociously terrible. I was woken up 4 or 5 times on consecutive nights by a woman who coughed as loud as possible. One morning the Fire alarm burst out of nowhere , proceeding to the lobby the lady at the desk (hardly speaks English) tried to inform me that they couldn't locate the area it was in or for what matter the alarms went off, causing concern of safety. I guess what I am trying to say is that the service department really is lacking and that it seems as if the cultural barrier really influences how service is provided.\\nThe city sounds don't bother me at all, I actually appreciate them versus the country setting I am used to. All together the price and the place really make most of the difference here. It is just about 2 blocks from the Westfield shopping center which boasts 200 shops. It's in a clean part of the city near any sort of food or activity you could want. If you prefer quiet nights this might not be the best place for you because it is located right next to downtown Market. \\nAs far as the checklist on the top of the page, I would say that the cleanliness is very good. Every morning I left I came back and it smelled fresh and the bed was made etc. The rooms however were set up as if it were a dorm room type with bright paintings and neon yellow and pink comforters as well as a flower shaped mirror. I am not 100% sure on the value as I am splitting with 4 people and do not know the final price for the week that I am staying here but for the location and what you get I rated it a 3/5.\\nAll in all, be careful what you wish for, especially if it is service because it might be hit or miss with this place. I am a stickler for service because in my mind it can really make or break a place. If I am paying you to set me up in a room I expect a certain amount of service for what I am paying. (A working TV would help, maybe Breakfast, and definitely curtains and working blinds.) \\nThanks for reading and enjoy your future trips, I hope this helped give you an idea what this place was like, at least from my point of view.</td>\n",

       "582102  Started off pretty good, until I had a small problem. The television failed to work, so I called down to the office who said the maintenance would be back the next morning (Tuesday). As of Friday nothing had been fixed so I gave up on it. This led me to the other things in the room that might be a little bit of a put off. The curtains do not even cover half of the windows leaving the blinds to do all the work in the privacy department which were broken on one side.\\nPrivacy side apart there were other minor items that were a bit bothersome. Only one of the lamps worked, no remote to try the tv again, but the room next door had one...? The sound barrier between the rooms was atrociously terrible. I was woken up 4 or 5 times on consecutive nights by a woman who coughed as loud as possible. One morning the Fire alarm burst out of nowhere , proceeding to the lobby the lady at the desk (hardly speaks English) tried to inform me that they couldn't locate the area it was in or for what matter the alarms went off, causing concern of safety. I guess what I am trying to say is that the service department really is lacking and that it seems as if the cultural barrier really influences how service is provided.\\nThe city sounds don't bother me at all, I actually appreciate them versus the country setting I am used to. All together the price and the place really make most of the difference here. It is just about 2 blocks from the Westfield shopping center which boasts 200 shops. It's in a clean part of the city near any sort of food or activity you could want. If you prefer quiet nights this might not be the best place for you because it is located right next to downtown Market. \\nAs far as the checklist on the top of the page, I would say that the cleanliness is very good. Every morning I left I came back and it smelled fresh and the bed was made etc. The rooms however were set up as if it were a dorm room type with bright paintings and neon yellow and pink comforters as well as a flower shaped mirror. I am not 100% sure on the value as I am splitting with 4 people and do not know the final price for the week that I am staying here but for the location and what you get I rated it a 3/5.\\nAll in all, be careful what you wish for, especially if it is service because it might be hit or miss with this place. I am a stickler for service because in my mind it can really make or break a place. If I am paying you to set me up in a room I expect a certain amount of service for what I am paying. (A working TV would help, maybe Breakfast, and definitely curtains and working blinds.) \\nThanks for reading and enjoy your future trips, I hope this helped give you an idea what this place was like, at least from my point of view.   \n",

Great bar too. The service was great, the location was great we were able to walk to Per Se for dinner which made it a great night. The hotel is an excellent elegant choice when in New York ! The staff was great and the hotel look beautiful during Christmas -- and don't forget to hit up the burger joint ! The hotel is in walking distance to Central Park area, Time Square, 30 Rock, and all the Shopping you can handle Long story short. Both bathroom sink and toilet was clogged. Front desk assitant manager - Margaret was rude in unrelated matter. Call to speak to general manager after stay. Spoke to Josette, \"executive assistant\" in great lengths. I asked for a refund, she said no, she may be able to do a partial refund and would have to get back to me. Spoke to her later and she said she never said she could do a partial refund and said I misunderstood. All the while, the General Manager never called back. If the the General Manager thinks she is too important for a guest, then I will never stay there again. They can keep the money. My second stay at Le Parker Meridien was as pleasant as the first. While I find some of the super hip stuff irritating, the service is great, as is the location of the hotel. This time, I had chance to use the gym, which is well equipped and has a great juice bar. Large rooms, a bit cold decoration though. Fantastic bed, to me. Very kind service, great location. Burger joint is just a myth, don't waist your time in the long lines. Just average hamburger. Baths refurbished in a nice way. Cafeteria is warm and comfortable. I didn't have any meal in the hotel. We have been travelling to New York several times a year for decades, and after much trial and error, have found a \"home\" at Le Parker Meridien. Its location is ideal: a few blocks from Central Park, Park Avenue, 1/2 block from Carnegie Hall, and a 1-minute walk to Times Square. Several subway lines are 1/2 block away, so we can get to the Village or Brooklyn easily. The \"scene\" is professional but with enough glamour to make us feel like we are someplace special. We try to stay in Starwood Hotels when we can but the extra French touches of Le Parker Meridien are welcome here. During the day, Looney Toons cartoons play on the elevator TV screens; at night there are black &amp; white videos of Thelonius Monk and other jazz legends. We used to stay at the Peninsula - l loved my daily swim in their rooftop pool. But with their prices &gt;$800 per night, that's out of our range these days. But Le Parker Meridien has one too!! Finally, there is a secret restaurant with no sign, off the lobby, selling the best burgers in Manhattan. The only sign it is there is the line coming out the door. There is simply no better hotel in New York for the money. Friends and I decided to go up to NYC for the weekend over Thanksgiving and were fortunate to get this hotel through Priceline.\\nWe are Starwood members and they upgraded both of us to higher rooms. My friend got upgraded to a suite and I got upgraded to a room with a beautiful view of Central Park.\\nThe staff was very friendly and the rooms were extremely nice and clean.\\nThe location of the hotel was great. Only a few blocks away from Time Square, Hell's Kitchen, and Central Park. I've stayed here before so I was looking forward to returning. The check-in was a breeze. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient. The room service food (French Onion Soup &amp; Mini Greens salad) were absolutely perfect. The swimming pool was nice, but it is in need of an up-grade. It's not the cleanest pool in the world and they don't enforce any kind of diaper policy - so kids in saggy diapers are in there all the time. Also, there is a $10 fee for using the pool. Normas restaurant had lovely food, but the service was a bit contrived. The host was arrogant. Also I sat for 20 minutes before anyone offered me coffee or juice. It took another 45 minutes to get my food and coffee. I was just starting the food when the waiter slapped down the bill and told me he would take the payment. I thought that was a bit much. On the other hand, the bar there is lovely ... sort of The Russian Tea Room meets Amman, Jordan ... with friendly, beautiful wait staff. My wife and I were just there for two nights this past weekend. Pluses: Great location one block from Carnegie Hall, Easy subway to Theatre district and Lincoln cente3r. Famous for its burgers, but long waiting line to get in. Swimming pool on rooftop ($10/day); luxury linens and down duvet and pillows. LED reading lights by bed and desk allowed reading without disturbing others. Lots of breakfast places on 56th St, and on 7th Ave -- all had good croissants. Minus: inadequate staffing at front desk made for long lines; calling concierge from room got no answer; $15/day charge for wi-fi; We preferred the Park Central -- less expensive same location, better service. Everything expected from a top hotel. Beautifully decorated for the holidays, close to all the great shopping. Extensive gourmet room service menu and Norma's is an experience in itself. Upgrade to a Tower room for a spectacular view. Already planning our next stay... Le Parker Meridein NY lived up to all my expectations. Great service, Amazing room with incredible views and the best location in NYC. Also, if you have a chance, go to the burger joint in the lobby. Absolutely the best burgers in NYC. You would never expect this place to be in that type of hotel. Unexpected surprises are what NYC is all about and LPM offers the greatest example of this. my second stay and will be back\\nthe location the bar the burger, the rooftop has a great view\\n your not going to find a better place for any price\\nwe had a ball , clean friendly and very good service. the russian tea room is next door for a night cap. This hotel has passable facilities, but the service for the most part is terrible. Let me list a few examples from the times that I've stayed at the hotel.\\n- Front desk staff has terrible attitude, rude.\\n- Additional charge for anything extra - fridge, microwave, etc.\\n- Asked us for additional charge just to borrow some wine glasses! \\n- Burger Joint is overpriced for the portion size. Stayed at Le Parker Meridien for a night when in town for a quick New York City Christmas fix. Lobby on the 57 St. side was PACKED. Tip: try to come in on the 56th St. side much easier than dragging your bags through the bar they how have set up at the 57th St entrance. Check in was quick and I got a room in the tower. Room was decent sized for NYC, but had the oddest closet, a tiny cupboard like affair with a curtain to close it off. I was in for one night by myself, so no problem for me, but if I'd been with my wife there would not have been nearly enough closet space. And, with the safe at the bottom and the ironing board in the tiny spot for longer items like overcoats or long dresses there was no room for such clothes. if this is important, I would check at desk for something with a better closet before you check in. Perhaps this was just what I got being a single for a one-nighter.\\nFor me the midtown location is great and the hotel is only a few blocks from several subway entrances. Cabs were good (except during the dreaded early evening hours, which is true everywhere in midtown) and are on the 56th St. side. Lunch or dinner tip: Out that 56th St. door and turn right (west) for a reasonably-priced Thai restaurant, Topaz, just 10 yards down the street, perfect when it's raining. Breakfast tip: Out the 57 st. door, turn left (west) and walk the 1/2 block to 7th, then up a block and on the west side of the street is a coffee shop, La Parisien. Though it has nothing to do with French food, a perfectly adequate spot to get eggs or whatever at a fraction of the hotel's prices.\\nI found the service very good, the little that I needed it, with everyone efficient and polite. Bed was very comfy, all the usual items worked well in the room which was spotless and decently decorated.\\nI'd go back again any time. Went up and back from DC for a trip that lasted less than 24 hours and this hotel was booked for us. Stayed one night, had breakfast the next morning at the Waldorf and lunch at the Four Seasons, then back to DC in the afternoon on the train. Pretty good trip except for this hotel.\\nIn a nutshell, all I am willing to devote, the lobby was splendid, including the gingerbread rendition of Carnegie Hall with the crane hanging overhead during storm Sandy. They called it \"The Hurri-Crane\" and it should win a prize. The room was small, sleek, cold and impersonal. On the plus side there was a killer view out the window from the 32nd floor. We dropped our bags and headed back downstairs for dinner. Guess what? No restaurant. We decided to go to the bar and have a glass of wine and ponder possibilities. Guess what? No room at the bar, where you have to be seated. Then we decided to try The Burger Joint, a dive-themed burger joint off the main lobby. There was a line and we were tired of lines. Back to the room and the room service menu. BLT's and a bottle of wine arrived 30 minutes later. For a hotel that charges a fortune,nthe only things worth comment werenthat gingerbread construction, the view and the wine, a very nice Syrah. I can find other hotels in this price range that deliver a much better experience for the same price. I have stayed at this property before but I usually don't because I don't need to be in midtown when I go to NYC. That being said, if you need to be in midtown, the hotel is in a good location. Rooms with city views are on the small side and even the \"suites\" are nothing to write home about. And if you need to open your window for ventilation, you will not sleep! It is noisy!\\nCompared to other SPG properties in NYC, this one is a notch below in terms of quality and service.\\nSo if you get a good rate, go for it. As a couple with a 2 years old little girl, we were excited to spend a night in the heart of Manhattan. We booked a junior suite with kitchenette for 1,009.00 dollars plus 154.33 dollars taxes. For this price you can really expect something more than just decent and guess what we got....a small and poorly furnished room with a tiny living room....but the worst is yet to come.....the kitchenette was only a sink with a microwave....there was not a single plate, glass, knife, fork or spoon...if you want to have these items, you have to order them and pay 5 dollars each to have the right to use them...more than a thousand dollars for a room with kitchenette and all the silverware costs extra....total RIP-OFF...we were treated like S--T, shame on Le Parker Meridien, definitely not a family oriented hotel, this is the worst of its class in NYC Very disappointed in the staff at this hotel. They could care less. Its a problem at many NYC hotels but this place takes it to a new level. The problem is it is a tight hotel market and it is sad to say I am paying $700 a night and I don t get much back.\\nSome things like showing up at night and there is no bellman to help with bags. A front desk staff that is very poorly trained. A pathetic night manager Mona who has no concept that she is in the hospitably business. Her English skills are poor and her people skills are worse. Come back from being gone all day and our room was not cleaned. Road noise from the street is the loudest I have experienced from My 20 plus years coming to the city.\\nThe Management of this hotel should embarrassed but the fact is they are the problem. Every employee I come in contact with could give a crap.\\n$15 for internet. I will include a photo of what looks like mold. What is wrong with this world when a major hotel chain in a major U.S. city can pull this kind of bait and switch ?\\nStarwood should be ashamed this place falls in every way. You can do better move on to another property. I would defintly recommend the Le Parker Meridien to anyone visiting NY. When I arrived I was greeted by the doorman who helped me bring in my luggage and showed me to the front desk. The front desk had my reservations and told me about the restaurants and Burger joint located in the hotel so I would be able to have dinner late which was great since I was expecting my brother around 10pm from his fight. I was helped by the bellman who told me about the ammenties offered by the hotel which may be helpful during my stay as well as how great the burgers are at burger joint which by the way are fantastic and I love the fact their open late. I loved Norma's which has the best orange juice and give you great portions of mouth watering food seriously! I loved the stuffed berry waffles with berry brulee and banana macadamia pancakes which were amazing!! The concierge was extremely helpful with the events I planned and also gave me great information on other things I may want to do!! I love NY during the holidays and everything is within walking distance. To the parade route to the great stores which were decorated with great Christmas decor. The rooms were very clean and loved the modern theme. From checking in to my stay the hotel covers everything. I would stay there again and next time I would take advantage of the gym and rooftop pool as well as the blowdry bar which I thought was great idea. My brother thought the barbershop was also great and would take advantage of it the next time we visit! The hotel is in a great spot in NY, however the rooms are horrible for two distinct reasons......the pillows smell like the last person staying here and the heat is unbearable. I am writing this in my hotel room during my stay. To simply put my problem with this location:\\n1) When I lay down on the bed, it would be nice if the pillow did not smell like it has been used for ten years. Very Nauseating.\\n2) Even though it is cold outside, it is torture to require your guests to sleep in 75 degree rooms with no ventilation. I'm sorry I am incorrect....there is a thermostat that supposedly allows you to turn on the AC. No matter the temp you set it at.....hot air blows out of the vent. TORTURE!!!!!\\nFinally this morning they sent engineering in to open my window.....Trust me I tried on my own...required a screwdriver to get the safety window open.\\nI could understand a lower cost hotel having these issues.....but for the premium they charge here.....this is insane.....worst night sleep ever. beautiful rooms, fantastic location, great hotel for location to all attractions.\\nwould recommend this to anyone. this hotel was very clean and staff were helpful. if going for the macey's parade this is ideal as the parade was at the bottom of street. Although we don't come from that far away, feeling of welcome that the staff provides really made our stay relaxing and so enjoyable. We love the gingerbread contest and holiday decorations for Christmas. This hotel knows the value of customer service and makes you want to come back again and again. The addition of the wall mounted TVs in the rooms is brilliant as it makes the room a lot larger (plus the quality of the TVs is excellent). We plan to come back again soon. My daughter and I spent 2 nights here at the beginning of December, and had a great stay. The room was spacious for a New York hotel, and very clean. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was fine, though the shower head could use an update. Would have been nice if there was coffee or water in the rooms, but not a deal-breaker. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially the concierge staff. They helped us navigate around what we wanted to do while there. Location was perfect for us, since it was close (walking distance) to all the sites we wanted to get to. The hotel was nicely decorated for the holidays. Hotel was beautiful. The room was bigger than most New York hotel rooms. Which made the stay that much better. Very clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful!! The gym is HUGE and the spa is fantastic We stay two nights and is really nothing bad we can say. Great location, great room, great service, but even that I wasnt feeling that extra that a nice hotel makes u feel. There was always a lot of people around the lobby area, we expect a better decoration in the room but we like it. Have always liked the Parker Meridien. Staff, location, restaurants are all excellent. But for a hotel of this caliber/price, I should be able to adjust the temperature. To add insult to injury, there is a \"bogus\" thermostat in the room to set the temperature but actually does nothing. A call to the \"engineer,\" as suggested on the thermostat confirmed that the only way to cool the room is to open the window. The small opening didn't do much except make it too noisy to sleep. Not being able to sleep turns all the good things bad! Seems like others have similar complaints, so please, Parker Meridien, fix the heating and air conditioning! A wonderful location for a week-end get away to the city..perfectly suited for a week long stay as well. \\nClose enough to Central Park for morning/evening walks, near enough to walk to Wollman ice skating rink in Central Park and Rockfeller Center. \\nGreat for shopping on 5th Ave and seeing the Holiday windows, near enough to Broadway and Lincoln Center. A stones throw away from a wide array of great restaurants that are moderately priced. \\nGreat meeting place to meet up in the \"lounge passage way\". Fantastic hamburger joint in the lobby and just the perfect location overall! This hotel is fantastic - great location, friendly &amp; helpful staff, wonderfully spacious rooms. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Manhattan. Special thanks go to Lisa Tharp who not only made sure that we had rooms close to each other but left us lovely fruit &amp; cheese plates with a friendly welcome note - really nice touch! We really enjoyed our stay at Le Parker Meridien. The hotel location was great. Near Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center, etc. and walking distance to Times Square (close enough, but far enough away from the frenzy of Times Sq) We went there for Thanksgiving weekend and we were also very close to the parade route. We basically watched it from outside the hotel, though we weren't right up front (the parade went down 6th Ave, about 100 yards from our hotel lobby. The indoor pool was great. It is on the top floor, with windows everywhere and beautiful views. There is also a deck you can go out on, during the day. We stayed in a junior suite which was spacious and comfortable for the family. Knave, a coffee bar and lounge is lovely. Very cozy place for a drink. Norma's was expensive but a great menu of yummy and unique breakfast items. We also went to the burger joint which was TINY...it's basically a take out place with some tables if you are lucky enough to get one (we did!) but it is burgers and fries and shakes....and that's it. Yummy, but limited menu. A few negatives we experienced at the hotel....we arrived at 4 pm (check-in was supposed to be at 3 pm) and our room was not ready. We had to wait until 6:30 which was inconvenient. We had been on the road since 9 am that day and just wanted to get settled and rest for a while. The room was nice but we found it to be very HOT. We couldn't get the room to cool down the first night. The following day we called maintenance. THey came and said the only way they could lower the temperature was to open the windows. A little strange, but seemed to work a little bit. The windows only open about 6 inches, which was a good thing as we were on the 37th floor with children. Seems to me the hotel should have a better cooling system, right?? I heard several complaints from other people about how hot the hotel was, so it is clearly a problem the hotel should address for the satisfaction of their customers. Another inconvenience was that there was no coffee makers in the room. If the hotel chooses not to have coffee makers in the room, that is fine, but I think at the very least they should have urns of free coffee in the lobby. Especially a hotel of this caliber, and on Thanksgiving Day/holiday weekend! There is a Starbucks right across the street, which I went to each morning. But the lines were painfully long each day. It shouldn't be so hard to get a cup of coffee. Not a great way to start the day. But as I said, overall I really liked this hotel. I thought is was a great choice for the family for the location, the pool and the suites. We had a great stay. I really wish the hotel would fix the problems we experienced. If they would, it would have been able to give it the maximum rating (5-star) Good sized rooms, clean, comfortable beds, quiet. Friendly service, lovely view. Norma's food is excellent but the prices are too high, $100 for breakfast for two is a bit much. Portions needn't be so large. People were taking out \"doggie\" boxes. Everyone at this hotel was a wonderful host when my choir stayed there Thanksgiving week. Such a busy time, and yet I never felt rushed or mistreated. The rooms are lovely...spacious for New York...clean and very comfortable. Our room was right by the elevator, yet we never were bothered by noise. The location is terrific. It was an excellent spot for the Macy's parade. We ordered room service one afternoon and the food was delicious. We did get a good group rate as we were there with a large group. My husband and I travel to New York often and definitely plan to stay here again! We have just got back from our first visit to NY. We went to see Macy's thanksgiving parade &amp; luckily the route had changed so we only had to walk outside to the first corner &amp; there we were able to see everything! The hotel is in a great location for walking to the shops, central sights like the Empire state building &amp; Rockefeller centre. About 3 minutes from Central park too! Our whole experience was great. Although we chose not to eat in the hotel, just because there are so many pubs &amp; restaurants close by, the lobby at the hotel always was filled with people going into the burger bar, so must be good,as so popular! The rooms are a good size, very clean, comfy beds &amp; always had HOT water!! If I had to sugguest ways to improve the hotel, it would just be to have complimentary tea &amp; coffee making facilities in our rooms. Easier free, Internet access would have been useful too, as it does get busy in the lobby with everyone using it free in there! I would certainly recommend this hotel &amp; definitely stay there again. Stayed here 7 nights in a very comfortable and quiet room. We found all the hotel employees to be very friendly and helpful.\\nOther than wishing for a coffee pot in the room, I give this hotel a thumbs up. Great location! Close to stores and Time Sqaure, walked around the corner on one side to Duane Reede and otherside was an organic Store that was clean and nicely priced. Only down fall was my daughter wanted to swim and you had to pay extra for the pool...so she did not swim. Large lovely , comfortable, stylish room. I called the front desk because room was warm on Thanksgiving night at 10:00pm and a maintenance man came within 10 minutes and solved the problem CHEERFULLY.\\nFrom check in to concierge assistance to check out, everyone was kind and helpful and welcoming.\\nNorma's is the BEST breakfast in the city.\\nMy only suggestions are that bathrobes, toothpaste, and q tips would be welcome in the room. Also, when the lobby is crowded, checking in can be hectic because there are no defined lines to reach the desk. Family of 7 traveling together, 4 separate rooms. Rooms were spectacular, everything you needed was there. Only issue was that the rooms were a little too warm upon arrival. Turning the thermostat off solved that. Everyone very helpful with directions for subway travel.Front desk was very polite and accomodating. Parking attendant very helpful also. Elevators are a little slower than I would have liked, but we had a great time. VERY nice. We have always booked the Meridien whenever we stay in the city, which is at least 1-2 times per year. If you could catch an e-mail special this hotel was a good value, with lots of space for our family of 3. Plus, our son, who is an avid swimmer, loves the penthouse pool. Unfortunately our most recent stay was a big disappointment. Here are the reasons why:\\n- Although a special was advertised on the website, it wasn't available for any date that I tried to book. I caved in and booked at a regular rate. I then received an email with an offer for a suite upgrade, which AGAIN was not available at all. Why offer discounts that aren't available? Extremely frustrating.\\n- The charge for a rollaway (even for a kid) is now a whopping $50 per night. When we started coming to this hotel, a rollaway in the room was free.\\n- The hotel now charges an outrageous $16/day for internet access which was included in the room charge until recently! \"Free\" access is available for 30 minutes in the lobby, if you're willing to sit on a hard bench for the duration, as the plush lobby chairs have been removed for \"renovation\". We skipped this \"option\".\\n- The hotel now charges to swim in the pool - $15 per family per day! There has always been a charge to access the gym (which is a full-blown gym, so I'm ok with that), but now we had to pay $25 extra per day just to work out in the gym and swim. What's next -- a coin lock on the bathroom?\\n- The pool is poorly managed. One section of the pool is supposed to be reserved for laps.The lap section was overrun by a gaggle of wild and screaming kids, who were busy swimming into everyone and batting each other on the head with foam noodles while their parents hang out on the sidelines drinking. When we nicely asked the lifeguard to please ask the group to move to the non-lap section, she was very hesitant and not only didn't bother to move the group, she allowed the screeching and chaos to continue. Needless to say, our experience in the pool was extremely stressful and unpleasant. If I'm going to pay $15 to swim, the pool should at least be managed appropriately. \\n- Service is mediocre at best. Housekeeping usually requires several calls, and dirty dishes stay outside rooms all day. \\nThe Meridien is still a fun hotel with large rooms in a great location. Just expect mediocre service and to be \"nickel-n-dimed\" to the tune of a few hundred dollars extra by the time your stay is over. for $500 a night, i should be able to set the room temperature to anything I want. But no. I walk in at 1am and the thermostat is set to 80 degrees. I lower it to 67, but warm air is still coming out of the unit.\\nThe front desk's response - we don't have air conditioning. Instead they tell me to turn off the thermostat and open the window. BUT the window doesn't open.\\nSO I wait for the engineer to come help. He takes forever. \\nSo now I have the EXTREMELY LOUD noises from the street cooling my room. \\nMy choices are either NOT SLEEPING because it's too loud in the room, or NOT SLEEPING because it's 80 degrees in the room.\\nDon't stay here if you want to sleep. I always enjoy my stays at LPM. They remember me at the desk every time I check in. The rooms are clean and comfortable. For NY they are even big! They have counters in the bathroom which is not all that common in NY and a must for make up etc. pedestal sinks are pretty but not to balance hair, make up etc. Nice amenities, decent room service and fun bar. The location is prime with the park, 5th avenue shopping, funky west side restaurants on 9th, walking distance to Times Square.. It's just perfect. Sad that the new building on 57th blocks many of the park views which are beautiful. Go up to the pool for some great views. I don't eat meat but people rave about the burger joint in the lobby. Norma's breakfast is decadent and huge. Plan to share. Not cheap either. Will always stay here. The Parker was great for us. We had a car to park and they had reasonable parking (no additional for valet or SUV as other hotels have. The location is great and getting in and out of the city to the hotel was super easy. It's also well located within NYC, near the park, restaurants, shopping, everything. There's an indoor pool which looked fun if we had more time. The room was very nice and comfortable and all the staff we encountered were a pleasure. Will definitely stay again. The room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel lobby is very nice. It is 3 blocks from Central Park south which was good for walking my dog. My dog was intrigued with looking at himself in the mirrors that are in the lobby. The hotel staff were wonderful and very accommodating. The only think that I didn't like was the refridgerator was not cold. However, there was an ice machine just down the hall. The neighborhood felt safe. The New York Athletic Club is right across the street and they will let guests play there. We surprised our girls (ages 5, 8, 10) for Thanksgiving with a trip to NYC~ After much debate we went with Le Parker Meridien mainly because of the location &amp; the fact that any negative response someone posted was quickly answered by Lisa in Guest Relations. Not every hotel is going to be perfect &amp; that goes a long way in my book. \\nPositives:\\nClose to EVERYTHING...quick (5) min walk to Central Park\\nquick 10 min walk to Times Square/The plaza/Rockefeller Center/Broadway, etc (we walked almost everywhere with my girls)\\nGuest Relations sent up Cookies the first night welcoming my girls to NYC for their first trip (big thumbs up from the girls)\\nHotel was clean, not overly crowded (although it was close to sold out), staff @ front desk was friendly,etc\\nKids loved cartoons in elevator\\nThe Pool upstairs was great. The view was one of the best in the city. You have to go to the outside area &amp; up the stairs to really take it all in. The guy @ the pool was super nice. \\nYes, its $15 per day per family, however, my kids really enjoyed it &amp; it gave us a nice break from the hustle bustle of the day.\\nNegatives:\\nConcierge...since we were traveling during a \"holiday\" I expected a little bit more from the Concierge desk. They did not know a lot about anything except what was right around the hotel. \\nThis to me is the biggest draw back of the hotel. Not the most friendly group of women I have dealt with on my travels. I called weeks in advance for help with Thanksgiving dinner reservations &amp; they seemed a little put off that I was calling. I even asked for help when we arrived &amp; it was very apparent that a \"local\" restuarant had dropped off their menu to sell to the guests. That being said, there was brown haired curly guy, that was very helpful. He sent us to Brooklyn Diner (Diner is too informal of a word for this place) for dinner. I am pretty particular &amp; I have to say it was wonderful. Super nice staff &amp; excellent food. The hotel needs to step up their game with Concierge especially in a place like NYC. They did not go out of the their way to help you with anything. Very disappointing...\\nHouse Keeping....Again, not the best. The room was clean, however, the first night a bag of lotion, shampoo, etc was just dropped off on our bed...not even sure why it was there. I used one of the bathrobes &amp; never saw it again. They do not look to see what is in the sheets before sending off to be laundered. They actually took my daughters \"blankie\" with the sheets. As you can imagine the sheer panic when my 5 year old realized it was gone. We did end up finding it (thank goodness) with the help of some very helpful front desk staff. A VERY big shout out to them! We also realized this morning that another item (my little ones panda pillow pet) was sent out with the wash as well. Too late at this point~Do not leave anything in the bed...it will be lost forever....\\nSide Notes:\\nThe doorless shower drains all over the floor. The hotel really needs to look into fixing it. Nice size though...we had the JR Suite &amp; it fit our family of (5) just perfect!\\nThe Hamburger place was fine, not the best I have ever had but certainly good. We had a better burger @ SarahBeths down the street. \\nCoffee/Bar was great. Super nice people!\\nDo not take \"bike taxi\"~total rip off, as they do not tell you the price is per person in addition to per block.\\nThe hotel does charge for everything. If you want to have your own items in the room you have to rent a seperate mini fridge which I found to be funny (we did not do it). The window does open a little bit in each of the rooms which was nice because we could not get the temp to regulate at night. There is not a coffee pot in the room which surprised me a little but there is a Starbucks on every corner, literally! \\nThe rooms are pretty quiet when the windows are closed. We brought a sound machine just in case &amp; did not have to use it. \\nOverall it was a fine stay. I would not rate it as a \"luxury stay\" but fine all the way around. Would I stay there again, yes &amp; would I recommend it to others, yes mainly because of the location. Le Parker Meridien was:\\n* easy to access, no queuing at reception, pleasingly a late 12 noon checkout...\\n* friendly staff\\n* a very spacious room (especially for New York City)\\n* clean, modern rooms with big beds\\n* close to Duane reade a chemist/food store for all your needs and opposite a Starbucks\\n* fabulous location for walking to 5th avenue, Central Park, Times Square\\n* a nice touch....we had an umbrella in our wardrobe just in case\\n* our room had all required amenities - bath/shower/hairdryer/plenty of electrical sockets/massive flat screen tv/great shampoo/conditioner/soap/body lotion/shower cap replaced daily/ ink pen and note pads also provided. There is a rather expensive mini bar but we chose to use the provided ice bucket and buy in our own drinks\\n* a spacious combination safe which you can fit your ipad in :) amongst other things \\n******** if you choose to stay here, please be aware that just like most other NYC hotels their can be excessive noise from hotel plumbing and outside traffic including late night bin collections.....take ear plugs to be sure of a good nights sleep ******** It's worth noting that I very seldom write a review for a hotel. I am posting this review because our stay at the Parker Meridien was throughly enjoyable. I would rate the hotel itself: rooms, staff, location as excellent and will definitely be returning to this hotel in the future. We have stayed at several hotels in NYC and Le Parker Meridien is now our favorite. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and engaging. The junior suite provides modern styling and spaciousness rarely found in a Manhattan hotel room. We are used to jam-packed rooms when staying in the city and couldn't believe a Midtown room with separate sleeping, sitting, and work areas. All the furniture and decor were modern and the room and overall hotel were very clean. The bathroom was large and had a tiled, walk-in shower. We didn't use any of the restaurant facilities because we like to explore the plethora of restaurant offerings that are within easy walking distance of this centrally-located hotel. I would highly recommend this property to anyone staying in Midtown Manhattan, and I would not hesitate to make reservations at this location again on a future trip. My wife and I just returned home from NY and we really enjoyed our stay at the Le Parker. \\nThe staff greeted us warmly, and that is worth noting in NY. Our room overlooked the park and the view was breathtaking. You really appreciate the size of Central Park with the view.\\nThe location is a block away from Central Park and Times Square. Location is excellent-period.\\nIf you are travelling with kids they can enjoy the pool. If you are travelling for business and want to get a work out in the gym is huge and full service. A very pleasant surprise.\\nWe went to Norma's for brunch on Sunday and yes it was a little pricey but the food was unreal and the vibe was NY cool. Definitely would recommend guests give it a try.\\nWhen travelling to NY keep in mind that your room is not going to be huge. This hotel has a great location, friendly staff and excellent gym, spa and pool. Ask for a room with a view of the park and enjoy.\\nAnother note is my wife and I both forgot our blackberry and I Phone chargers...nightmare. The consierge was able to charge both our phones. Amazingly generous and helpful. I stayed in a junior suite with friends which was spacious and clean. I most appreciated the early check-in which was very helpful. The pool and the view from it and the roof were also a real pleasure. The only shame was a mix up over the reservation at Normas which turned out to be no one's fault in particular just a misunderstanding but it meant I didn't get to try the famous brunch. The location is fabulous, close to so many places and fab for shopping! Le Parker Meridien is an outstanding hotel with the feel of being in a top rated condo. Friendly staff and very knowledgeable of NY. Norma the on site restaurant Sunday Bunch was worth the 1 1/2 hour wait. I will definitely be staying at this hotel on my next visit.\\nTy B Our first stay was a year ago &amp; did not meet our expectations. The rooms were dusty &amp; the maid service was not what I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. However, our most recent stay was a total turnaround. I would like to commend Lisa Tharp, the guest relations director. She takes guest comments seriously &amp; takes proactive measures to make sure guests are happy with their stay. I cannot say enough about this person as we travel extensively &amp; she clearly takes her job seriously. As for our stay, our kids enjoyed the rooftop pool &amp; the decadent breakfast served at Norma's. I would advise ordering half of what you would normally order as the portions are quite large. The location is convenient to central park which was a treat for my two children. We will definitely return! Just stayed at Parker Meridian. Friendly staff, Excellent! onsite restaurant for breakfast at Norma's. Expensive morning coffee but Starbucks across the street. Don't forget your bathing suit to enjoy a swim with a wounderful view of the city on the 40some floor. Will be going back without a doubt. Great location; great brand; still solid value. This hotel has had its ups and downs and is now trending back up. Rooms are clean and somewhat spartan, which some of us like. Professional staff - visible when you need them, invisible when you don't. Food is good if pricey. Good location, comfortable bed, great coffee in the lounge area, great burgers at the Burger Joint.\\nHowever!! our room sevice breakfast was hardly edible... $23 eggs Benedict, $17 bowl of oatmeal. Asked about getting some last minute broadway tickets, we're told $250. Per ticket. Went upstairs and got great seats (orchestra) for $100........ (On our ipad) No in room movies, can't adjust your own ac/heat.. We come to NYC every November. Will be going back to the Hilton for the value/amenities. Check-in was a breeze and the desk staff was courteous, attentive and quick. Hotel has a bit of an older feel but rooms were still very nice. Location is great as you are in walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central Park, etc. Only had two issues: 1) several black strands of hair were hanging from the hair dryer when I entered the room which was a bit disgusting and the hot water was not working the morning I was checking out. Overall, I had a very nice experience and would stay there again.\\nMake sure you check out the top deck (on the same level as the pool). You need to sign a waiver to go out on the deck but the view is great. we arrived in new york-it was pouring so much we missed bthe hotel under our raincoats, so by the time we reached we where soaking, even the clothing in the suitcase, all wet...\\nthe receptionist gave us a room right away, it was about 11am.we were happy to take ahot shower.\\nsome of the staff were too cool, barely looking up from the computer, not helpfull as I had difficulties with the bordingpass printing, they just told me to try at another plasce in the 3rd floor.for a 4 star at the rate of 300 $ I definitely expect more service.\\nthe rooms are rundown, mold in one corner of the bathroom.not possible to open the windows, you need to call someone to open them for you and close them again.the room smells of cheap airfreshener.the rooms are big but anonymous.\\ncarlos at the reception was very nice and went out of the way to make things happen, thank you carlos it made all the difference.location is good..I do not recomend the palce and would not stay there again. Recently stayed at this hotel in NYC. For New York, the room was quite big, but quite uncomfy for 3 people. My wife and 16 year old ook the King size bed, and I was relegated to the roll away (which they normally charge $50/night for). Terrible sleep the first night. My wife and kid left the next day (to go back home), so the second night was quite comfy.\\nThe hamburgers were amazing - always a large line-up.\\nThe staff are very friendly.\\nMy pet peeve was that the sink and the tub always got clogged up. Figured the Housekeeping staff would notice and get it fixed, but they didn't bother.\\nThe location is amazing - there is a 24 hour food market right next door. I think I will make this hotel my \"regular\" when visiting NYC. Just hope they do something about the plumbing.......... The room HVAC didn't work, and it seemingly could not be repaired. The bathroom and room were nominally clean with dust on the broken clock and hair in the shower. The \"top rated\" fitness center has dated equipment that is noticeable to any avid fitness enthusiast even through the disguise of the renovated walls and ceilings. The staff are surly with but two exceptions: Mohammed, the bellman, and Alex, of Knave. Friendly front desk services and helpful. The room decor is contemporary and I love the swivel TV panel partition which you can watch TV either from sitting area or bedroom sides. Great locations and 1 min walk to 24hrs drug store which carries lots of necessities. Solid hotel experience. We needed a place to stay after hurricane Sandy. We had been out of power for 10 days and were uncomfortable imposing on friends any longer. We decided to take a little mini-vacation and Le Parker Meridian had rooms available. Good service, friendly staff. Junior suite was nicely set up. Good location. I would definitely recommend it. It took our minds off the problems at home. It's really all about location and since it's perfect there's no reason to write more about that.\\nWe booked a parkview room and got a room at 23. floor. Sure, we could see the park in between the buildings in front of us. But with a building covering 98 percent of the view we felt obliged to kindly ask for a better view. The room was otherwise really nice. And... \"sure, of course, no problem, will 39. floor be nice ?\" Great service at the desk! And great view !\\nWe also enjoyed the casual atmosphere and small amount of twisted humour here and there. (Please don't use the minibar as a fridge. If you need a fridge, please let us know and we will be happy to provide you one :) \\nSomewhat strange though, to find absolutely no information about the facilities in the hotel. But the concierge could tell us everything.\\nI must mention the bed, which was just fantastic !\\nMany reasons to stay here, but I'm not to sure about coming back. I expected a little better value and missed a sort of \"soul\" you can find at many other hotels. The building itself is probably most to blame in that matter, but the staff is doing a great job trying to compensate. \\nBut of course, if you like to sleep well in a spacious clean room (with a view) within walking distance of everything, don't look any further ! We stayed at Le Parker Meridien one weekend in October in a junior suite. \\nThe positives:\\n-GREAT location close to Central Park. \\n-huge room, sitting area, amazing bathroom.with incredible space, great products\\n-staff friendly &amp; helpful.\\n-price for value (we paid $310 per night)\\n-upgrading to a junior suite puts you on the highest floors with a decent view.\\n-great little burger restaurant in house. You can call from the room and order your food and skip the long line trailing through the lobby. Very easy fast food you can bring back to your room. \\n-Starbucks right across the street with free wi fi\\n-UNBELIEVABLE pool on the 42nd floor overlooking Central Park. You pay extra for the pool use but it's so worth it. views of city and park outside on roof. Grab a chaise and lay in the sun. It's free and one of the best things you'll do. \\nThe negatives\\n-no coffee maker in room/free coffee in the lobby\\n-lobby is rather small and loud\\n-parking will kill you. Google \"central parking coupon\" and you can get a coupon and save about 40% off parking. We paid $40 per 24 hours rather than $65.00\\n-no free wi \\n-restaurant is expensive. \\n-you can't easily find coffee until 6:30 am on the weekends. Gesh!\\n-you pay to work out at the fitness center &amp; swim. Really??? Really???? Good service and nice sized rooms and bathroom. We stayed partly because it was recommended to us by a friend and because of its midtown location. It has a pool but you have to pay extra to use it as you do with wifi which was a bit annoying seeing as we had paid a lot of money to stay there. The hotel has a burger joint attached to it which is pretty good, people queue night and day for it.. Norma's is supposed to be good for breakfast and lunch too. \\nEverything you need is in the room, iron, umbrella, flat screen tv etc but do not remove anything from the minibar unless you want it because it automatically is added to your bill even if you replace it. Take your own hair dryer though if you have long hair because the small one provided isn't very powerful. \\nThe staff were helpful until we were evacuated during hurricane Sandy due to the collapsed crane opposite, when they handled the situation really badly.. Rooftop pool on a clear day cannot be beat. Jr. Suites are great for small families. Have stayed here many times over the years and hotel was pretty cool when we first visited. Elevators always seem slow. Maybe they should put cartoon tvs on each floor to watch while waiting for the elevator vs. having them in the elevator cars. I have stayed here several times and LOVE the location... but each time I come back I am reminded that this hotel does not live up to its promise or potential. This visit, the heat in my room did not work - on the second maintenance visit to fix it, the maintenance man told me 'this is a problem with a lot of rooms, I'll just bring you a space heater.' So I spent the week getting up every few hours to turn the space heater on/off. I think consistent, dependable heat should be a basic requirement in a $450/night hotel room. Having stayed at the Meridien Parker from Oct 26th to Oct 29th 2012, I can say that the hotel operated with supreme poise and effectiveness in the lead up to Hurricane Sandy. The staff couldn't have been more professional, considerate, helpful and friendly if they tried. Even though we faced mandatory evacuation on Oct 29th, as the crane attached to the highrise next to the hotel collapsed, we received detailed updates on a regular basis regarding the expected time frame for re-entry to the premises. And even when it was deemed too dangerous to re-open the hotel, the staff went the extra mile to ensure that everyone's belongings could be collected in a safe and timely manner.\\nWhile the storm made the experience somewhat uncomfortable, we would stay at the Meridien Parker again in a heartbeat. Some rooms need updating and brightening up, Although I was there at the end of October, air con needs improving. My room was either cold or stuffy.\\nThe location was terrific and the hotel's customer service was even better. Spacious, amenities good, no coffee in room. Went to shows, shopping down 5th Ave and as far as Macy's, went to M&amp;M Store, Victoria's Secret and everything in between. Ate on East River side down near Wall Street area - South Street pier very 'user friendly' with lots of shopping and eats. Also got to Central Park - walked everywhere except to Statue of Liberty. The subway is very usable, though obviously Hurricane Sandy has since taken its toll. Checked online and as SPG member got a 'pay ahead and save' rate - which was quite helpful. Skipped museums, but saw so much of the city. Very comfortable for our family of 3. My family and I stayed at the end of October. We liked our room. We found it clean and well organized. We also enjoyed the location. My only constructive criticism would be that we partly chose the hotel because the pool. Upon entering the pool room we were informed that it would cost us extra to use it. This was not made clear at booking and was slightly disappointing. We were not going to inform our 7 year old son dressed in his bathing suite that the pool wasn't going to happen. Aside from this our stay was comfortable and we would probably go back. Stayed here several times. This is a very nice hotel, with clean ande very spacious rooms (by New York standards). All mod cons in the room, including DVD player. Lovely and clean batrooms with great showers.\\nBeds are very nice and you will most definitely get a good nights sleep.\\nGreat swimming pool on the rooftop as well. \\nJust one street from Central Park and the Subway. Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops close-by. Highly recomended! Stayed mid-October for four nights on a package trip with Thomas Cook. Great location for Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Museum Mile, Times Square and lots more of the city's attractions. Service was couteous and efficient, rooms and bathroom clean, and very comfortable beds. Power showers and plumbing also very good. We'd asked for a quiet room, and our certainly was, very little street noise on 22nd floor. However, air con was noisy, so take ear-plugs! Breakfast at Norma's expensive so we didn't sample it. The burger joint behind the curtain in the lobby was constantly busy and was highly rated by a friend. Would happily use this hotel again for a city break/short stay. I go to NY for business a few times a year and office is around the corner so Le Parker was walking distance but what a mistake:\\n- 600 dollars per night was standard rate for a room which is expensive and one expects top service, but here we go:\\n- every morning there was a 20-40 min wait to get a table for breakfast (and the breakfast is very expensive btw). The few days I decided to wait I would say more than 1/3rd of hotel guests opted not to wait but to leave the hotel just to get breakfast. I had to turn to room service instead which has very few options;\\n- i tried to use the laundry service. just dial 53 the laundry form says, which i did for 2 days - no one picks up. There are no instructions on how to drop laundry off (apart from dialling 53) so i hung the hotel laundry bag with completed form on my door handle in the morning, only to find the same bag on my sofa when i returned, still dirty;\\n- I had to stay a few days longer (so you can imagine my hotel bill @ $600 per night at this stage) and run out of toothpaste one night. I ask in reception if they hand out these small travel portions but just get pointed to the pharmacy around the corner...\\n- Since I had no USD on me I go to the hotels cash machine, which charges $ 4 extra per withdrawal; \\n- Felt thirsty when i came back and took a small bottle of still water from the minibar....charged to me at $6.53, just plain robbery; \\nThere is just no reason to stay at a place which doesnt appreciate your custom and tries to rip you off every way you turn. Last time for me - there are so many better places in NY.\\nSoren Fantastic location and staff very helpful. Our room was on the 22nd floor and had a great city view. Had a problem with our bathroom sink, reported it to reception in the morning and by the afternoon it had been fixed. It had been years since I stay at Le Parker Meridien because my annual conference chooses the hotel. This year I returned because of a bad experience at the conference hotel last year and I needed a change. So glad I did. The location is perfect for a quick jog in Central Park or a short walk to Times Square or shopping on Fifth Ave. The Burger Joint is great for that late night munchies and the brunch at Norma's was delightfully different and fulfilling. The staff was very helpful and friendly without being pretentious. The location is just enough off the park that the businesses near by are much more afforadable and it is easy to keep on budget. Recently stayed here for a quick business trip to the city. Pleasantly surprised to get this hotel/location for the price (much lower than comparable hotels in the area and below our corporate cap). Attentive service all around - everyone from doorman to front desk to baggage storage was very nice. Good room size for NYC/Starwood property. Clean with comfortable bed, updated (or looked that way) furnishings. Top notch bathroom amenities (Roth). Beautiful bar off of lobby - typical NYC price for drink but came with nice selection/quantity of snacks. Had heard about Burger place in lobby - ran in there for quick lunch - was quite a scene and good burger! We ate fairly early (12:30 - 1) and line was huge when we left. Location is great - easy walk to stores, work, park. So far, I think this is one of the best hotels in the city, modern and classy lobby, I got a nice room and good service. \\nAnother point is Burger place, located on ground floor... Very convenient.\\nThis place is just south of central park (3blocks-big bonus) and easily walkable to times square, and had several subway lines minutes away. Definitely consider if its in your budget! Amazing mid town location next to lots of subways so super easy to get everywhere. \\nCan imagine in the 90s this was a crazy luxury hotel but seems a bit dated now. \\nNO TEA &amp; COFFEE FACILITIES IN THIS HOTEL, which is totally crazy considering it is supposed to be a top hotel, but maybe that's cos I'm a Brit... \\n$10 fee per day to use the gym facilities, but brilliant classes.\\nCharges for putting any item in the fridge. \\nCleaning not so great... \\nGenerally good but not amazing. Close to everything you want in New York. The room was large, very clean and comfortable. Skip the burger downstairs and go to 5 Guys down the block. Staff was attentive and quick to take care of a leak. They arrived as soon as we departed the room and everything was cleaned up by the time we returned. If you're visiting to do the \"tourist thing,\" this is your perfect home base. Spectacular location in Manhattan near 5th Avenue shopping and MOMA. Very comfortable, large (for NYC) rooms and beds. Breakfast at Norma's is truly special. Excellent subway access and rather easy to find cabs. A great hotel in the great location: One minute walk to the Carnegie Hall and five minutes walk to MOMA, or to the Central Park. And ten minutes walk to the Lincoln Center.\\nThe service is Excellent and the bed is comfortable. Dream-like breakfast and a very quiet, beautiful bar which serves delicious cappucino. This is a perfect hotel for who travels solo, and for a couple. I stayed very often in this hotel. I like the view from the rooms to the central park, the comics in the elevators is a great idea. the service is very friendly, so its great to stay here for business or holidays The Le Parker Meridien in my opinion is the best Starwood property in NYC. That includes the St. Regis. Yes the St Regis is nice and has a great address, but I've found it a bit too over the top and you really don't get the value when you compare what you get to what you pay. The LPM is a luxury hotel in every respect. The lobby is simple but grand. The service is excellent. The rooms may seem a bit dated until you realize the theme in the Mad Men era. Clean lines, and simple. The location of the hotel is set away from the frenzy of Time Square and just two blocks from Central Park. Within a few minutes walk, you can be in Central Park or the heart of 5th Avenue shopping, or surrounded by the lights of Time Square. The hotel gym is ridiculous. You can't call it a hotel gym because it puts most sports clubs/gyms to shame. There's also a hidden little gem tucked away in the lobby that serves one of the best burgers in NYC. The Burger Joint is nothing you'd expect when you stand in the pristine lobby. Walk in and you're transported into a neighborhood greasy spoon that serves the perfect burger. A must try even if you're not staying at the hotel. A rock solid upscale hotel with wonderful staff. The room was large, clean and perfectly functional, albeit lacking any particular charm. An excellent bed and huge TV. Better for business trips than couples (we were a couple). Brunch at Norma's was insanely good. The staff, the location, the lobby, the random burger joint in the lobby, Norma's!!! \\nI didn't give it 5 stars because the view from the rooms say \"park view\" but my view was actually of a newly constructed building thats 30 feet from the hotel. So for the most part I had my shades drawn. As stated by others, the rooms are just average as far as furnishings. Felt spacious. The bed was a comfortable firm. The hotel has 2 street entrances on 56th and 57th. The lobby is very nice. I kept hearing about their famously delicious hamburgers, but did not have time to try them myself. Located on same block as Carnegie Hall. Just a few short blocks from Central Park. This hotel is easy to miss as their signage is not very prominent and faces sideways. location, location, location,....You can walk to Central Park and Broadway, shopping on 5th, and great restaurants on upper West side......it's midtown west on 56th- between 6 and 7th. rooms were average size....comfortable, bath was small but sufficient. Bar is great, also good good for coffee in am....Dry Bar for hair style blow outs is a plus Stayed last week as part of our trip to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary.\\nThe hotel has a great location with fantastic views to Central Park.\\nThe staff went above and beyond their responsibilities to make sure we had a pleasant stay.\\nWill definitely stay again. Great location. Excellent service all around. Room were very chic and well planned out. Larger than most rooms we've stayed at in New York. A bit on the pricey side for what you are getting (the main reason I didn't give it all 5 stars) but overall worth it. Rooms were clean but need a little more minor upkeep. At this price point throwing in some mini bar items would go a long way to making people very happy at very minimal expense to the hotel. If you are planning an NYC get away, are sick of the Times Square hotels, and are ready for an upgrade, I think you'll be pleased by Le Parker Meridien. We would definitely stay here again. Ideally located just a short walk to Central Park , shopping, and several restaurants. The lobby is elegant and front desk staff, Carlos, was very helpful. The room service was good especially breakfast menu from Norma ( supposed to be one of the best breakfast in NYC). However, I was less than impressed with the room. While it was fairly spacious, certain area reminds me that this is not up to par with Westin, Marriott. I haven't seen a room that use cheap looking curtain and aluminum rod in lieu of wooden door for the closet area even at lower end hotel such as Fairfield Inn. If I chose to stay with a non park view room with starpick rate of $250, it prob OK. But for the usual price near $400 / night it certainly not worth it. I actually chose park view starpick rate of $300 which is not too bad considering the location. But other than the room, everything else was good. The view of Central Park from 32 floor was not that great with a lot of building blocking part of the view and not worth the extra $50. If you can get near the 50th floor it might worth it. Burger joint in the lobby has a very long line but as a guest you can order it without waiting in line. I tried a Thai restaurant near by, Topaz, and found the food to be substandard. Morimoto restaurant , 5 miles away, was worth the $10 taxi fare with excellent appetizer and entree from iron chef. Just stayed for three nights. Great location, rooms are well-appointed - but what makes this hotel excellent is its staff. The concierge on this visit found just the right restaurant for me and a friend who had recently gone through a divorce. We needed something lively with a good scene to remind my buddy of the possibility of good times ahead -- but not so loud or tables so close together that we couldn't talk. The concierge delivered with just the right steakhouse within walking distance on a busy Saturday night. \\nBut more importantly, when I stayed there a few years ago and had a kidney stone -- their reference to a great concierge doctor who made a hotel call to my room to see me -- saved me a trip to the ER! (Still painful, but his diagnosis saved me the drama of a strange emergency room.) Far better hotels in New York at half the cost - try Distrikt Hotel on 40th Street. If it wasn't for switching hotels mid-stay then my special trip to New York would have been a disaster!! Wi-fi at 25 dollars a night!!!!!!!!! I won't take up a lot of space repeating what others have already said. The location is good, the lobby is beautiful and staff really try to be friendly and helpful, but the rooms are really basic. Not much better then Motel 6. \\nIf you are not going to spend a lot of time in the lobby, try to get a better room somewhere.\\nWe didn't use the restaurants or bar. I don't see the need to spend $30++ on breakfast when there a lot of great places nearby for less the $10.\\nThe first room we were put in did not have a working phone or mini bar fridge. The second was ok and larger, but there really no views. Generally it's quite.\\nNewspapers are available at no charge from the concierge.\\nAnd why should you pay to use the gym and $16 for in room Internet. I know it's New York but they are really taking advantage of their patrons. My wife and I checked in to the Le Parker Meridian for a 4 night stay that was a mix of work and play in New York City. We like the area and its proximity from a business standpoint as it is close to most of the meetings I needed to attend, but it is also great for people that want to access the great shopping on 5th/Madison Ave, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Carnegie and Central Park. We like the fact that there are are entrances on both 56th and 57th St as that makes getting to the hotel from different areas very easy and convenient. The hotel is clean and nice but the rooms are somewhat small with very little drawer space and the bathroom is literally a closet. It is not realistic for two people to be in the bathroom at the same time. As for prices I think they are reasonable for what you would expect in New York City. The only disappointment is the $10 charge to use the gym. While it is nice, it is the first Starwood property that I have had to pay to use the gym as a gold member. The umbrella in our closet came in handy as it rained heavily one day of our trip. If you are basing your choice on location I think this is a great hotel. If you are looking for luxury I would look elsewhere. We didn't spend much time in the room so based on location it was great for us. Would look around next time in New York City but would be open to staying here again. This was my third stay, and while I wouldn't have thought it possible, Le Parker Meridien keeps getting better. The rooms, location, and rooftop pool are all wonderful, but it's the staff--and I mean every single hotel employee I've met--who make this hotel a truly joyful place. Everyone is friendly, helpful and professional. That's what makes Le Parker the only place I'll stay in NYC. My fiancee and i stayed here recently and were not disappointed. The staff were courteous and friendly and extremely helpful and obliging. The room was light,airey and clean, the bed was so comfortable i was sleeping ten hour nights! And the pillows too...so soft. There was also a big screen tv on the wall if you got the chance to watch it as there is so much to do in NYC! The view of Central Park was amazing and it was quiet up on the 22nd floor too. One minor detail, the room couldve done with some darker curtains as the room got light fairly early in the morning without them plus be aware of a small charge for using the pool and gym too, only 7/8 dollars per person each time. The location is great, right on the doorstep is Central Park and numerous bars and restaurants plus its a short walk to The Empire State Building and Times Square. Just returned from staying in Le Parker Meridien while on a girl's break to NY. The hotel was great in every way; lovely spacious room tastefully and thoughtfully designed and decorated, very friendly service, classy bar, good food and great location. The roof -top pool was amazing! A fab hotel in every way. very good location .nice modern well managed hotel .\\nrooms facing the park have excellent view.\\nexcellent reservation and check in.\\ninspite of late night we had a smiling and helpfull staff at check in.\\nspecial thanks to sophia and mona....\\nnice restaurant at lobby with special breakfast menu and smiling staff We were back at the Parker Meridien for our annual Anniversary trip to New York and had another wonderful experience. Great location, great staff and great rooms (with new televisions)! We'll be back, again and again. What a terrific time in New York City! I travelled with my two sisters and three nieces. We stayed at Le Parker Meridien on 56th St. What a terrific hotel. The rooms were great, the beds truly are stupidly comfortable and the front desk staff and concierge were great. \\nBe sure to go to the Burger Shack behind the curtain in the lobby. The burgers are awesome!!!\\nWe enjoyed coffee and wine in the bar. It is a lovely atmosphere, but $18.00 for an okay glass of wine seemed a little steep, but hey it is NYC.\\nI would strongly recommend this hotel and a trip to New York City for everyone. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to be amazed at the lovely, helpful people in the city!!! Loved the location of this hotel to Times Square, 5th Ave, and Central Park.\\nHotel rooms are showing signs of wear but we liked the dining options within the hotel\\nand the value of the Junior Suite vs. other hotels in the city for a room the same size. A half block from the subway, two blocks from Central park, 5 short blocks from Times Square.....I cant think of a better location to get to do all the things we have learned to love about New York\\nThe Hotel being an SPG lodging means a lot for us as I just used points to upgrade to a wonderful view of Central Park. The people inside make the stay enjoyable and the Burger Joint gives a person hunger pains the minute we walked in for check in\\nWe will stay here again soon This hotel is dated and showing signs of wear, decent, but not special in any way. It is busy, the staff is decent and attempt to be helpful, but it is not a good experience It may be that they are not able to shine given the chaos in the lobby, there is not enough staff. There are so many great hotels in NYC in this price range I would suggest staying somewhere else. If you do end up here you should read below.\\nDo not stay in a lower room facing 56th street. The garbage trucks apparently begin working between 10pm and 11pm to clean up the streets. The noise was so bad i called up and requested another room. I was on the 8th floor, if you want a decent nights sleep avoid at all costs a room facing 57th on a lower floor. My reservation was originally for the \"Tower\" they said that they upgraded me into a larger room, which they did. But if you enjoy sleeping don't get duped by the upgrade, stay in a smaller room in the tower. It is quieter. I was much happier in the smaller tower room. I reently completed another excellent stay at the Parker Meridien hotel. I have been staying 3-4 times per year at this hotel for the past seven years.\\nThe hotel is well-run and maintained. It is located in an excellent mid-town location near Central Park and Rockefeller Center. Driving to this hotel from points north of NYC is also very easy and you get the big benefit of avoiding the messy and crowded I-95 and the various East River tunnels and bridges. Simply take the Hutchinson River Pkwy to the Cross County Pkwy. At end of Cross County, take the Saw Mill Pkwy Southbound which becomes the Henry Hudson Pkwy. Pass under the George Washington Bridge. When Henry Hudson Pkwy ends at 60th Street, Simply make left turn at the 56th street traffic light and travel straight until you reach 6th Avenue. You then pull up in front of the hotel.\\nAs a Lifetime SPG Platinum member, I was well treated and provided as usual with a Junior Suite upgrade. Room size is good for a Jr. Suite and everything was clean. The valet parking ($52/day) is easy and efficient. Overall, the Parker is a very nice and well-run hotel in a prime location in Manhattan. In terms of location for visiting the top museums, Central Park and upscale shopping areas, this hotel is hard to beat! I already look forward to my next stay! Excellent service and the spacious rooms made my stay at Le Parker Meridien memorable. There were a few ways in which the hotel could be improved e.g a second turning down of beds in the evening if they had been used in the afternoon. Other than that, the staff were wonderful and the waiter delivering my morning coffee made a happy start to my day. Room service was also very quick. We had a wonderful stay at the Le Parker Meridien. From our arrival when the bellman who was very busy made sure to tell me how to get to reception and follow with our bags a few minutes later when he was able to get the group e was helping taken care of. The front desk staff was also very nice. We were upgraded to a deluxe room and it was huge, not only by NY standards, but any city. Bathroom was tiny and lighting not great, but other than that it was a nice room. Towels were newer, soft and fluffy, amenities were good. What really stood out was the concierge staff. I have been to New York 8-10 times before, and have family that lives in the city, but always check to see what is recommended. They definitely steered us perfectly! I appreciated that when we asked about going for a drink or a place for lunch they took time to ask a few questions to see what we would be interested in, and gave very thoughtful suggestions. We had our 3 year old daughter with us and everyone also made an appropriate fuss over her. It was a nice grown up hotel where she felt very comfortable. Definitely on our return list!\\nI was also surprised at how quiet the rooms were, especially considering we were on a lower level. We have stayed at the Soho Grand, St. Regis, Helmsley Park Lane and other places in NYC, but for the price this was a great value. This is a superb location! The Parker Meridien offers a fair value for the price. It provides stylish, yet comfortable hotel surroundings. The restaurant is fantastic - great scene and decor. I first stayed at this hotel in 1991, and we will absolutely stay at the Parker Meridien again when we are in New York! My partner and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 7 nights at the end of September. First impressions of the hotel were great, the entrance lobby being very grand with modern art on the walls. The service at check in was excellent and friendly, however there was no offer of help with our 5 cases to our room. We stayed in a park view room on the 37th floor, and the room was fantastic. The view over central park was stunning, we didn't close the curtains for the entire week such was view both day and night. The room had a huge TV on the wall with lots of channels which was good for entertainment whilst we rested after a long day and before going out for dinner. Location-wise, the hotel is very central for all tourist related places and there are lots of good restaurants very close to the hotel. We tried the Burger Joint (the queue was around 20 minutes) and although it was good, it wasn't amazing, perhaps I had high expectations after reading so many good reviews. The barbers shop was a nice touch and I had a old fashioned wet shave which was well worth the $40 I paid. All in all, we had a lovely time in NY and the hotel was a great base to see the city and comfortably relax in. Well recommended. We stayed in a nice very large room with fabulous views of Central Park (for those with a room on the other side or lower down the view is also to be had from the top floor where the pool is, as well as a great 360° terrace). The location is obviously terrific - a couple of blocks from the Park, close to shopping and theaters, lots of public transportation nearby. Service was very attentive (and had to be because a number of things you would normally expect were missing from our room when we checked in). The breakfast place on the ground floor (\"Norma's\") is great; very crowded on weekends (make a reservation!). Minor criticisms: the furniture could do with an upgrade and the airconditioning controls were not working properly (we wound up putting newspapers over the vents to keep from freezing). We and our friends had a great birthday weekend at Le Parker Meridien. The hotel was a perfect location to travel from to all our outings. The service at the hotel was excellent, giving us tips and directions on where to go. We had a great New York experience. Let me start by saying that I am a well travelled individual and have stayed in some beautiful hotels around the globe therefore I think my thoughts/opinions count.\\nThis wasn't my first choice of hotel for my recent trip and it was with some trepidation that I agreed to stay here.\\nOn arrival I was upgraded to a junior suite which was a nice touch - checking in process was acceptable. \\nThe general feel of the hotel is \"Tatty\" - the lift interior is scratched and bruised and the corridor leading to my room was littered with used food trays and wine glasses. Most of the hotel room doors had seen better days.\\nWine glasses remained on the corridor floor for a 24 hour duration.\\nEntering my room took me back to a 1960's bedsit. The artex ceilings had seen better days and in places the paint had been renewed creating varying shades of white. The net curtains had a yellowish hue to them and were certainly in need of a good wash. \\nThe air vents were clogged with fluff and dust and the 1960's wooden interior had seen better days. The primitive double glazed windows had collected a lot of grime over the years and there was an array of dead moths/insects in the room which bewildering had not been cleaned up.\\nBreakfast 15 minute wait so went to a nice place on the corner - Rue 57.\\nThe rate charged was well in excess of USD 500 (room only), and yet I was still charged USD 15.00 a day for wifi and USD 10.00 to use the Gym. In addition to this when I requested to use a computer/printer to arrange the boarding pass for my flight I was to find out that this would incur further charges.\\nThis hotel is tired, dirty and behind the times - believe me, for the money they charge you can do a lot better in Manhattan. AVOID. Great property .. great location ... the Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridien,just off the Lobby, is Killer !!! When you see 30 people standing in line to get a Cheeseburger and Fries ... it's GOOOD !!! So easy to get to anything in NYC from Le Parker Meridien ... location, location, location We stayed two nights over a weekend in early October 2012. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous, from the unloading of luggage at the curb to check-in, to ensuring that we had enough pillows, to answering questions about taxis, subway stations, and tourist attractions. Likewise the service and menu at Norma's Restaurant within the hotel was first class. You felt every inch that you were staying at one of the finest of New York City hotels. I would certainly stay there again! Stayed 4 nights for a birthday weekend in NYC. Chose this hotel because of its location. However, Darius made our stay amazing. It's hard to find people who care in NYC, and he is someone who definitely makes a difference. We checked into the Parker Meridian after traveling for 6 days. We had a reservation for 5 nights. The first thing I wanted to do is unpack my suitcases but unfortunately there wasn't a dresser in the room and the closet was very small. If this is a one night stay go for it. The location is great and the staff is very nice but the room takes minimalism to a new level. Fortunately, the manager who was extremely accommodating upgraded us to a Jr. Suite which had a built in armoire that was more than adequate. The room is a good size and can more than accommodate a dresser and larger nightstands, hopefully it's in the plan. Stayed 7 nights on 40th floor with a Park View. Super friendly, yet completely professional Front Desk staff. Not overbearing valet/bell people. Quickly developed a daily routine: a) up at dawn to enjoy the Park; b) Breakfast at off-the-lobby Norma's (but get there first thing; beware mega-sized portions); c) run around for business and/or fun all day; d) Cappuccino at off-the-lobby Knave Cafe; d) different top quality restaurant each night all within walking distance with concierge recommendations being spot on; and e) collapse into supremely comfortable bed so as to rest up and do it all over again next day! I recently spent two days at the Parker on business. A few quick notes:\\n1. It has a great mid-town location (though so do a number of other hotels).\\n2. The room was fine, clean and comfortable. \\n3. The small bar area is a nice place to have a drink if you can manage to swing one of the seats.\\nNo real negatives, just nothing particularly special about the hotel to set it apart. Its actually somewhat colorless - though in fairness, a Monday-Wednesday stay isn't exactly the time of the week most hotels show their charm. \\nSo, depending on what type of pricing you can get, it may be a perfect place for you to stay on your trip.. I am very fond of the Parker Meridien. When I lived in NY I belonged to the gym and walked through it weekly. When I moved away, we stayed there and my kids loved the cartoons in the elevator. And it is still a well run and charming hotel, with a couple of glitches. The rooms (or at least my room) had no way to change the temperature. Instead there is a note to call the desk if you want it changed and an engineer will be dispatched. Not helpful if you wake up at 3 am too hot and are trying to get back to sleep. Second, I didn't see a place to get coffee and run - the only choice was Norma, which was slow and very expensive, albeit quite good. But I don't really need a pound of lox on my bagel :) Otherwise, it remains a fun hotel for business or family travel. Hotel was far more modern than I expected, staff fantastic - funky little lounge and we loved the burger bar. Above all, clean and comfortable, and great location. My friends and I agreed that we would stay here again...because we never even got to the pool! Le Parker Meridien is a great place to stay. We were able to get a discounted price for this place. The service was fabulous and friendly. The room was big enough and the beds comfy! My daughter and I were in New York to celebrate our birthdays and the Meridien was the perfect spot to do so. It is close to everything. The doormen and staff provided a safe environment. Plus, Central Park and the Carnegie Deli are a short walk away! The hotel is very conveniently located for a business trip to New York City. The staff is attentive and the hotel offers a number of on-site venues that are great if you don't want/don't need to leave the premises - ie. great restaurants, new gym. My only compliant is that the rooms are a bit on the older side compared to other hotels in the area and the bathrooms are quite small. I will NEVER again stay at this hotel. The front desk service was horible. It was my husban't bday so I booked 3 rooms for us and our guests. When I arrived late at night the hotel wanted to charge me for 4 rooms claiming I had a no show. All of my guests showed up, but I only reserved 3 rooms! The night manager \"Mona Salh\" was exremly rude and was notin anyway trying to resolve the situation. The rooms are note worth $600/night, they didn't even leave shampoo/conditioner each day and had to call and request them each day we were there! I'd rather stay at the 4 seasons or St. Regis where I know what I am getting. The hotel doesn't have a business room just a small kiosk which is a nightmare as well! Never again! This hotel is in a great spot. It is within walking distance of Central Park and Times Square. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go. The subway was only a block away. \\nThe line was long at check-in but because of that the staff sent up a fruit tray for us to enjoy later. \\nThe room was very nice and had a nice view. \\nWould certainly stay here again. I will give the Parker Meridien one more chance. I stay in hotels about half the year. When I'm in NY I usually stay at a W, but thought I'd try the PM again. \\nThe things I liked about the PM include the location and the design of the rooms. The staff is also very good, and I appreciate the high level of service. However, on this trip, there were a MILLION little irritating things broken / wrong:\\n- I wanted to see about pre-ordering an early breakfast because my husband had a very early flight the next morning. I picked up the room svc menu but a child (apparently) had scrawled all over it with a pen.\\n- I got on the phone to call room service. No one picked up the phone. After 2-3 minutes, I hung up. \\n- I started to get into bed and thought \"I'll just call from the bedroom phone\" (we were in Rm 1718, a Jr. Suite) but it was broken. So much for room service.\\n- The next morning, I needed to iron a shirt. Someone (same child?) had scrawled all over the ironing board with a pen or magic marker.\\n- The safe wouldn't close, so it blocks the door unless you lock it.\\n- It was raining, so I grabbed an umbrella and started walking across town with it. The handle fell off.\\n- The sink in the bathroom was clogged -- the water barely drains out.\\n- The AC in the rooms was either on full-blast or not at all, so we got to choose to freeze or sweat.\\nSo, would I stay there again, or recommend it to a friend? Maybe. I'll probably give the Parker Meridien hotel one more chance, but if things don't improve, I'll choose a different option. I have been to NYC many times and have my favorites uptown but needed to stay in Midtown this time for a quick 24 hour stay and was looking for a reliable, somewhat luxurious hotel for a competitive price. I ended up staying at the Parker Meridien and loved it! It is in a perfect location. I never needed a cab after I arrived and was able to walk to everything. I was upgraded to a deluxe room and it was very large - tons of space. The room was very clean and the bath amenities great. I was a little surprised that in such a large NYC hotel there wasn't some sort of security at the elevators (security or key card). Ate breakfast at Norma's in the hotel and it was fantastic. Will definitely stay here again! Smart hotel in a great location close to Central Park, diners and Empire State, Times Square etc.\\nGreat view from pool but £10 to use. Popular restaurant although we chose to eat out. Would recommend. This was undoubtedly my most pleasant experience in New York. A short trip to the city was not long enough to appreciate the outstanding location, service and amenities at this hotel. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Perfect location to use as your base, close to all great shopping spots and sightseeing (2 blocks from Central Park). Park views from the hotel are stunning. I would recommend a Park View room. The Dry Bar downstairs was such a treat with great service and outstanding work - not badly priced at all! The Burger Joint lived up to it's reputation, with an awesome cheese burger - I was able to bypass the long line and call in the order from my room. All in all, a great stay. I will definitely be staying here again! My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The rooms were much larger than expected and were clean and modern looking. Very comfortable beds- we slept great! Good location near Central Park. The staff was friendly and helpful...we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others. One night stay, I am a premier member of whatever the club is called - SPG? In any event, in business for one night. I always ask for a \"quiet\" room, which is always tough in Manhattan. They put me on the 5th floor, which turned out horrible because you re close to the street. I was too tired to change rooms or even ask. But seriously, when someone asks for a quiet room you are put on the 5th floor? I think this hotel is 42 stories. So I was able to hear the trash trucks on 56th street. Good times, and I just blasted the air conditioner to drown out the NYC garbage trucks, although it was not enough to drown out the occassional motorcycle noise.\\nThe room itself was decent, and the walk-in shower was a smart design. I had what they called a mini-suite or junior suite, which is usually what I get.\\nCheckout process was awkward; you would think they would stuff the invoice under your door or permit online check out. But nope, these folks are stuck in a process that is old and slow; you have to wait in line and make it \"official\". What a complete waste of time for everyone...\\nIn any event, two stars for these people, as they likely too advantage of the knowledge I was only in town for one night. Stayed here the weekend of Sept 20th to 23rd. Had a great stay. Staff was always very pleasant and willing to help. The location of the hotel was very well situated. We were within walking distance of everything. the staff was fantastic - from the doorman upon our arrival to the front desk at check-in and housekeeping at the end of the night. Our room was perfect - clean and a good size. The location is perfect. We were lucky with a good deal at somewhere we wouldn't normally afford. We really enjoyed our stay. A cool burger joint, the beautiful bar/cafe and great pool, though u need to pay extra for it. Staff generally friendly. We like it as it was beautiful but not stuffy. Room was a good size with a great view. A fine hotel with great views on the park side. Wonderful view terrace above the penthouse that somehow goes unmentioned on the website---was a highlight of our stay!\\nDid not like the fact that you have to call the engineering staff to adjust your room thermostat--the guy came very quickly, but I've never had to do that. Room service breakfast was NOT worth the price--$47 for tepid scrambled eggs, limp bacon and soggy toast with near-frozen butter.\\nLove the espresso bar, Drybar, and the comfy beds though! We'd stay again at the right price, and would go elsewhere for breakfast.\\nStaff were very helpful and polite. I stayed here for two nights with my husband and two ying kids, and loved that the hotel has a Burger Joint, great breakfast place and pool on site. It is also within walking distance to Central Park, which we loved. The hotel and staff were great, the hotel itself is nice, and the rooms were fine. However, they do charge for every little thing: coffee, Saturday paper, Wi-Fi and use of the pool and gym. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. I booked the hotel on short notice, and was only going to NY for a short stay. The service was great, rooms were clean, ambiance was nice. Wish I would have been able to stay longer. I would stay here again. Not right in Times Square, but easy walking distance to all the sites. Stayed here as I couldn't get in to my favourite hotel, Essex House. Now I remember why I like the Essex House so much. The Parker Meridien charge top dollar rates and therefore that sets your expectations. Aside from location I dont know how they justify the rates.\\nThe room is basic though the bed is very comfortable. No tea or coffee making facilities, no complimentary water in the room, actually no frills at all. Internet is also chargeable and not very quick either.\\nThe one thing that annoyed me more than anything was being asked to pay extra to use the gym facilites. I have never experienced that before and I could tell the guy on the gym reception was deeply embarassed to tell me. Poor guy. It's a really cheap policy by the hotel to try and screw every last dime out of you. I won't stay here again. Well, it is all relative. I had dozen or so stays in NYC over last years, and this is definitely one of the better stays. I moved for one night from much worse hotel with the price tag astronomically high. Usually, in NYC you settle for less room, service or location, due to very high prices. I had really good deal, and being Gold Preferred Guest of Starwood doesn't hurt either. No complains about location, service and size of the room. All was very good. Bar and breakfast prices are way too high, no need to eat or drink there. Had a nice quiet room, without the view though. The room had a bit dated and tired decor, although quite a good size. Internet should be free, not as Gold status perk. Would recommend to stay there, if the price is right: definitely under $300. Le Meridiem Parker combines classic elements and also modern desing and facilities. They have a fancy bar and a great burger place at the same enviroment. It's worthy to pay the fee for the pool, this is one of the greatest views you will have from the city and you can lay at the sun looking to the city and the Central Park.\\nViviana and Stefanie from the Front Desk were so nice!! They were very friendly, smart and made me feel comfortable and definetely made my stay much enjoyable.\\nBy the way, they are just few steps from Central Parl and some block from Times Square!!\\nI definetely recommend it.\\nRodrigo Casanova I go here off and on and absolutely love the location. It's close to Columbus Circle and Central Park and minutes away from Fifth Avenue. When I think of traveling to NYC I immediately think\\nOf staying here. They often have Flash sales or promotions for the $250 to $299 range, however\\nWhen you get the notice via Starwood, hotels.com etc those prices are gone, either from a blackout date or the Hotel claims\" sorry that rate is no longer in our system\".then you are stuck in the $500 range for a king bedded room.and really unless you go on Business and your company\\nWill pay or have disposable income( which I don't)then who can really afford that? The last time I stayed there was last spring for a few nites, I was awoken very early in the morning with sounds\\nThat felt like an earthquake( which everyone else in the hotel felt as well). Apparently and with\\nNo prior notice to me a new building was going up right next door. The Meriden Hotel was litterly\\nShaking from the jack hammering. I asked for a modification in my room rate and they said no.\\nI was surprised considering this is supposed to be a 4 or 5 star Hotel. I did think they would have\\nOffered me a free breakfast or 1/2 of my next stay, anything but alas nothing.\\nI must stay the staff is very friendly , and beds are very comfortable and location great,but unless you get good value then look elsewhere, there are plenty of hotels in New York City,\\nLy My wife thinks I am a hotel snob, maybe. I booked the Le Parker Meridian because a friend was also staying there. I couldn't have been more pleased. Outstanding service was provided from the moment we walked through the lobby. Our room was ready and very nice with modern decor and a view of Central Park. The hotel was convenient to everything we wanted to do in NY and the subway was a short block away for the trip to the WTC Memorial. This hotel exceeded my expectations and we were 100% satisfied with our stay. The staff were friendly and helpful to two newcomers on their first visit to NY, the bar on the ground floor of the hotel had the best cappuccino, I thought I was in Italy.\\nGreat stay, excellent service and best of all, one very happy wife. I have had a wonderful experiences at this Hotel in the past but after the last two stays they are now off my list. The staff is very good at the desk and in sending someone to help with the air conditioning.(The air conditioner was dirty too.) The room was dirty, we had to go buy socks so our feet would stay clean. the carpets were stained. The bed covers had stuff on them and the cover sheet was not supplied on one of the beds. I hate to tell you what a bear blanket was like. The chair in the room had no table how do you put a drink or anything down. The TV has no movies or TV guide station. I could not wait to get out of that room and pay my 600.00 for the experience . Upon arrival we decided to see if our room was ready early and to our surprise it was ! It was nice to check in unload our bags and go sight see . We decided to ride bikes through Central Park . Great experience.I love Central Park !\\nWe came back to the hotel to shower and change and saw all these people standing in line next to a curtain wall so I asked why was there a line and was told that is the famous hambuger rest !.We were hungry so we decided to check it out . Food was great ! small room but very good non the less !\\nOur Hotel room was very large on the other hand by New York Hotel room standards and the bathroom was also very nice size. Very modern and up to date !!!\\nI would love to come back and stay again at this hotel as they say location,location ! Nice location, always spotless, yummy room service food, fun quirky old cartoons and film clips shown in the elevators, cute bar area, entrances on both 56th and 57th Streets, modern, simple chic rooms, nice shower, soft fluffy bathrobe, soft fluffy white towels, blow dryer provided, good flatscreen TV and channels.\\nOver the years I've had some temperature problems. They don't tell you (and I tend to forget in between stays) that the thermostat which appears to regulate the room doesn't in fact regulate the room... you figure it out in the middle of the night when you're burning up and you keep turning the air down but eventually realize it's not changing. The only solution to it being too hot in wintertime is to open the windows. Unfortunately, when I try I can never get them open (it's usually in the middle of the night). But if I ever remember to ask when I check in, the hotel will send somebody up to open the window for me. Also be aware, they just don't tell you some things! For example, I found out from another guest at my most recent stay there is actually a pool on the property. I never imagined there was one, and they never mentioned it and I've stayed here regularly for almost 20 years! Would you believe in all these years of having me as a regular customer, they never once mentioned to me they are part of a rewards program I could have joined? Just found out about that today while staying at an entirely different hotel. I also didn't know until recently that they have a famous Burger restaurant on site, but it's unmarked and behind a sort of curtain and nobody mentions it to you or tells you about it. I found that out from a native New Yorker friend of mine. In their effort to be chic and hip, they act almost a little too chic and hip at times. (Like, if they have to TELL you they have a famous burger joint behind the curtain, then you aren't the kind of person they really want eating at the burger joint.) I believe they have a fitness center that costs extra to use. They have a small gift shop and bar area. When I forgot a toothbrush on my most recent stay I asked for one at the front desk but they told me I'd have to buy one at the gift shop. Then they confided that the one at the gift shop would be overpriced (which I appreciated) so I should go to Duane Reade (which I did). I've occasionally had a few problems. For example major construction on a visit in the past year meant a giant, and I mean really loud constant banging sound in my room. Upon checkout I told them how bad the noise had been. They seemed nonchalant and sort of shrugged it off. They didn't seem to care that I had a problem. There is a barber shop/beauty salon on the premises, though I haven't had occasion to use it. If you're taking a taxi around the city, don't go out the 56th St. entrance where you'll have to tip the bellman and get a cab that may be angry if you're not going to the airport. Instead, go out the back entrance on 57th St. and wave down a cab yourself. Great location. Walk to Central Park, try the campy diner Moon Rock Cafe on 57th St. nearby, lots of great eateries in 3-4 block area. Beautiful hotel in a convenient location between pretty much any subway stop desired and two blocks from Central Park and many museums. The park view room is fantastic, with stunning view of the park - a breath of fresh air from looking at the city! Service is helpful, but not outstanding, and although the furnishings are nice with some modern touches, you can also see the wear come through. Rates were lower than normal which made it a great value, may not recommend otherwise. I found this hotel to be perfectly well-situated, staffed with knowledgable professionals and a nice change from the gigantic Manhattan mega-hotels. My room was large by NY standards, well-maintained and the bed, was ridiculously comfortable. I'm a SPG member, so this is my new default hotel to book in NY. This is a terrific hotel property. Nice finish out, great location and friendly/helpful staff. The rooms are very clean/modern and well furnished. They even provide Herman Miller chairs next to the built in office desk.\\nThere were only 2 items which left me wanting. First, the hotel did not have any sort of Iphone charger clock and one of the outlets I tried to use to recharge my iphone was not functioning. Second, the price of the hotel was fairly expensive. I paid $575 for 1 night in a standard room, on a Wednesday. I think for $575 you can pretty much stay at just about any hotel in NYC and next time I'll check out the Mandarin Oriental. The high price is also apparent at breakfast where a glass of orange juice costs $10. \\nAll in all it was a great stay and I have no regrets, but for me to consider going here again I'd like to see a price point closer to $350-400 a night for a mid-week stay.\\nHope this helps! While visiting NY as I did every second week i decided to use some of my SPG points to try the Parker Meridien and we are so glad that i did. I then made this my first choice when visiting NY and now that we have moved here, always urge family, colleagues and friends to consider and stay at the Parker Meridien.\\nThe rooms are big and comfortable, the room service delicious and the overall atmosphere of the lobby and hotel fantastic. Breakfast at Norma's is a MUST! There are so many choices and hotel guests get preferential seating even if you do not have a reservation. The burger joint always has a line-up and were the most simple yet perfect burgers and worth the wait.\\nThe staff at the front desk were great and when i sent a thank you to the Manager Sylvie, i received a response within 48 hours. Overall the Parker was fantastic and if you are considering it, make the reservation, eat on site and enjoy every minute of it. Nice location at 56th &amp; 6th with friendly staff and impressive lobby... However, the city view was of the back of a building with scaffolding and workers at our window and the bathroom was tiny, outdated and the door couldn't open without hitting the toilet. Bellmen,doormen &amp; valet pass off the bags so frequently it costs us $45 to get out of the hotel with one bag! We stayed there only for one night (Saturday) before fashion week, so i imagine the hotel was probably more busy. But the overall experience was a bit like staying at the busy train station. We arrived at the hotel st 1.30 p.m. the wait for check in was 10 or so minutes. The girl informed us that our room is not ready and please come back at 3. OK the check-in time is 3 p.m. but normally most large hotels can give you a room by 1.30. When we came back at 3 p.m. and after staying in line for another 10 minutes we were told that our room is still not ready and come back in an hour. No explanation or apology was offered. \\nWaiting for the elevator takes A LOT of patience so be ready to wait and wait and wait. \\nThe gym is $10 and the pool is $10. Funny that they call it hotel amenities when you have to pay for them separately. Why stop at the gym, maybe they should charge for the elevator say a buck per ride and if customers dont want to pay they can use stairs.. \\nThe concierge (we only dealt with the older gentlemen) was as helpful as \"tourist information\" center. When asked to recommend a place for brunch with outdoor seating on Sunday the only suggestions was sarabeth's - this place is in every tourist guide; yes its good but on Sunday if you want to get a table you need to wait for at least 1 hour! \\nThe rooms were good; large and comfortable. Wif is paid for service ...so annoying.. \\nNYC has a lot of great hotels but this one is not it. Yes it has a nice bar and its buzzy but if you want a nice service and a smile and maybe something a little more exclusive and intimate this is not the place to stay. There are better places to stay in the city. \\nP.S. Just a note to say we did use our starwood points to book this hotel, so maybe that's why we got I used my SPG points to stay 5 nights at the Parker Meridien for the US Open. The location was perfect for us (Midtown Manhattan) as it was close to everything we needed, especially the subway. The room (Jr. Suite) was spacious with modern decor. The two things I didn't like about the room was that it only has one TV (it was mounted on a wall that swivels back and forth between the sitting area and the bed) and no coffee maker. \\nI did think that the front desk clerk that checked us in could have been a little more friendly. She didn't confirm the type of room we were assigned until I asked about it. I would expect a little more courtesy from the front desk, especially since I'm a Starwood Gold member I have to say that the hotel is perfectly located and has easy access to almost every place you will want to go to the city. The rooms were extremely clean and surprisingly quiet. We were there for almost a week and never heard any traffic noise or horns so sleep was never a problem. The bar area was lovely and we enjoyed sitting with a glass of wine or coffee. And don't miss the burger joint...best burgers in NYC!\\nThe problem area was the lack of amenities in our room. First of all there was not a coffee pot! Yes there is room service, but i want my own coffee pot i don't want to wait for someone to bring me coffee every morning. Also, there was only one chair, no table, and most of all....NO DRESSER! The room was very spacious for a new York hotel, there was plenty if space for a dresser or a small table to eat if you order room service. There was only one drawer...come on...we are two people staying for a week in new York!!!!! I have clothes...lots of clothes and shoes and no place to put them! I would think that that for $500+ per night they could put in a couple of drawers and a coffee pot! Okay so I consider this hotel much more than a hotel and that is why I love it. \\nThe room's have been slightly touched up recently (carpets and wall paper). Also, for NYC the rooms are spacious.\\nThe best part is what the hotel has on site...\\nNorma's - The best breakfast... ever.\\nMoonshine - The coolest/unique spa... ever\\nThe gym is HUGE.\\nIts a urban resort...Enjoy! my daughter and I stayed at the le parker meredien hotel. the stay was fantastic, the burger bar is not to be missed. Hotel rooms very comfortable.the hotel is well situated , easy acces to all amenities. have staye din other meredien hotels in europe and would stay with any other group. excelent service and value for money. We had a nice stay at the Meridien. Our second time there with kids in tow. We took advantage of the family special and got a spacious and comfortably outfitted room. The rooms are looking a little tired, but they are a good size by NYC standards. The kids loved swimming in the pool and the proximity to the park and kid friendly attractions in NYC was a boon. The staff was not as attentive, or friendly as they were during our previous stay and at times seemed downright out of it. When we went down to pay for the sitter we had booked well in advance through the concierge desk, as instructed, we were told there was no sitter booked and that we couldn't put the charges to our room as we'd been told previously. After much confusion and back and forth between the concierge and the reception the whole thing was sorted out and we did indeed get our babysitter and the method of payment was accepted. Only exception would be the bellman, who especially made the kids feel welcome from the moment we arrived. We were hoping to eat at the burger joint but the lines were too long. We will return to the Parker again, we hope it'll be less busy (we were there during the Tennis Grand Slam) and we'll have better service. We stayed here first week of September and arrived home yesterday. Couldn't rate this place high enough to be honest. We were on the 38th floor, sweet view of Central Park. Nice big room, big TV, 6ft bed. Everyone we dealt with couldn't help enough. If there was one very minor issue, there wasn't an ice machine on our floor although the front desk were more than happy to send up a bucket when we needed it.\\nWe didn't use the hotel bar, restaurant or the gym, but (and here's a biggie), we did get several takeouts from the Burger Joint which is located just off the front desk. Seriously, if you like a great burger, then this is THE place.\\nWe hope to make it back soon! Arrived at the hotel at about 8:30 am after a 9 hour flight from Hawaii and was pleasantly surprised to find that our room was ready. We used SPG points and paid for an upgrade to a view of central park but Michael at the front desk informed us that there were only rooms with partial view. We decided to forego the upgrade and Michael put us in a room on the ninth floor with a partial view of Central Park anyway. The bellman, Maurice was also very courteous and helpful with a lot of information. These two individuals started our stay in New York on a very positive note and we enjoyed Norma's for breakfast. The Burger joint did not live up to its hype. We thought it was good but not one of the best we've had. The location is very close to Central Park so we rented two bicycles and had a nice ride around the entire park. There are some small hills to climb and my wife (65 years young) does not exercise regularly so we did have to walk our bikes in several areas. Although very close to Central Park, the location on 56th St is quite a distance from Times Square and say 41st St where Newsies is playing. Enjoyed our stay. I've been going there for business trips to NYC for 18 years now -- wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. Terrific rooms, awesome staff! OH and did I mention the breakfasts at Norma's and the food at the Burger Joint? First class all the way! great room, location and experience, placed in midtown manhattan, just a few blocks from central park, carnegie hall and 5th avenue. rooms are rather large, very clean and quiet, bed comfortable. staff was helpful (a special thanks to lamia for her kindness). top floor pool with a spectacular view. burger joint is worth visiting though there can be some awsom I really liked this location, close to the park, right between east and west sides. Starbucks is immediately adjacent on both sides of the hotel, and a 24 hr grocery is on the corner. Rooms were very spacious for the price and there was plenty of storage. Our Jr Suite had a great built in desk with good lighting, I enjoyed eating breakfast there and reading the NYTimes. Excellent, large shower and the towels were good, a must for me. However, I thought the bed was not very comfy and the pillows were cheap.\\nWe were there over Labor Day and the US Open was going on, there was a big crush in the mornings and some guests reported up to a 30 minute wait for an elevator to get down to the lobby, yikes! We were on more of a night schedule so this didn't affect us.\\nStaff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, I like the renovation and feel the rooms are clean and modern. For the $ I preferred this to the St Regis, and I think this location is better. Our group of four couples stayed over the Labor Day weekend. We were all very pleased with the hotel. The service at the front desk from arrival until we left was excellent. \\nWe ate breakfast at Norma's for three days straight. To say that Norma's food is exceptional doesn't even come close to describing the amazing food. There is a waffle dish called WaZa that is unique and includes a cornucopia of fruit. The prices are fairly high (at least for what I am used to in Houston), but are worth the cost (except possibly the $9 orange juice).\\nTo work off the calories from Norma's, we exercised downstairs at Gravity. The gym is excellent -- especially the spacious weightroom on the 2nd floor.\\nThe one challenge with the hotel is that when it is a busy time of day, the elevators can be a little slow. Also, one of the elevators had doors that were not working well over the weekend, so they opened and closed slowly.\\nThe location for Le Parker Meridien is superb. We were able to walk to Central Park and Times Square. Also, Calvary Baptist was right across the street.\\nOverall, we highly recommend Le Parker Meridien. We were fortunate enough to have chosen to stay at LPM during our recent weekend in New York. With the blurring amount of hotels in the city it is often difficult to choose where to stay, and often you end up in a nice hotel but stay in a 10x9 room. That is not the case at all here. The rooms are very nice and very roomy for NYC. Obviously if you look at the location you'll see that you are right between broadway and central park so you never have far to go. The hotel staff are very helpful from the front desk check in, to the concierge, to the bell staff. We recommend staying here if you have the chance. Perhaps industrial minimalist is your thing... then LPM is your hotel.\\nIve been looking forward to staying here for quite some time. Business and opportunity brought me here at fairly decent corporate rate - still it was slightly disappointing. And the opportunity to get an upgraded room is probably nil since its a common known fact that most biz travelers have the SPG Am3x card.The fact that biz travelers prefer SPG properties is going to hinder your chances at getting that upgrade or prime corner room, etc. I got a room with a shared door... first couple of days was fine... I think the person next to me was playing in the US Open?! I noticed a US Open limo waiting outside as a cart was being taken from the room with a huge tennis racquet bag... and then the problem occurred. A fairly loud couple moved in the following day. Lucky enough they sleep pretty early and I didnt hear a peep after 11pm. However, my preference was for a quiet room -- which the receptionist seemed to obliged with a room away from the elevator and away from ice machine. But shared door aside...\\nPros:\\nModern room\\nLack of huge furniture pieces made the room seem pretty big for NY standards\\nClean, lovely cleaning staff\\nGreat lobby and entrance, bar area and burger joint (slightly hidden - didnt go but heard positive reviews)\\nTV is massive at prob 46\"\\ndesk is great set against window...love that\\nhowever, my room faced hilton club... with windows looking back... great for working not great for \"browsing\" NY sky line \\nlocation is fantastic... near Central Park, but a bit of drive to hot spot restaurants in lower Manhattan... but far away from time square to give you some peace.\\nduane reades and chase banks nearby... Fifth Ave shops one street down... great location all around \\nCons:\\nfelt underwhelming relative to expectations\\nmodern as in minimalist industrial cold feel... probably not my think... although i like 'modern'\\nwifi is $17 per connection, thats right per connection, although that might be the norm around here (not sure if you can swap the 'registered' connection to dif PC/tablet/smartphone)\\nbathroom pretty small\\nshaving razor is $7; how about free? is that too much to ask\\nIs there a lobby to relax? not sure... wasnt told or invited\\ngym, $10, i suppose thats not awfully outrageous... not sure is thats entirely common here\\njust not much to warrant an immediate return... as i type from another NY hotel room which is tiny compared to LPM but fantastically designed... review to come. Ordered room service several times... its good food... pizza is good, breakfast is great... prices are high. couldnt get the bill under $50/meal... might have been worth it to go downstairs in the restaurant.\\nSummary... great location, great size, good layout, ok feel. New York is expensive.. your expectations should be as well. placed in midtown manhattan, just a few blocks from central park, carnegie hall and 5th avenue. rooms are rather large, very clean and quiet, bed comfortable. staff was helpful (a special thanks to lamia for her kindness). top floor pool with a spectacular view. burger joint is worth visiting though there can be some queue to get in. be prepared to pay for any extra. additional fees are charged to your bill for the use of gym, pool and internet. My husband and I have stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 14 years. Since then, it has become part of the Starwood chain which we love. The rooms are lovely, nicely renovated in a contemporary fashion but not over done. Friendly front desk, concierge, and bell man staff. We have a very special feeling for this hotel and for a longtime member if it's staff, Naji. He saved my huband's life in 1998 and we will never forget his kindness and professionalism. My husband was not feeling well that day but refused to see a doctor. Naji helped to change rooms because, at that time, we detected cigarette smoke. That is no longer an issue. Naji looked at my husband and said \"Mr. B, you don't look well, may I call the house doctor for you.\"My husband listened to Naji , the house doctor came, and to make a long story short, my huband was extremely ill. Had Naji not gotten my husband the medical attention he needed, he might have died. There are many wonderful employees here and the location is terrific. I have not eaten in the main restaurant in many years but enjoyed the hip burger bar a couple of years ago. If Le Parker Meridien is in your budget, I highly recommend it. Prices vary with the season and availability.\\nSincerely, \\nSue B. Have stayed here twice recently - once for a weekend trip with my husband in Dec 2011 and again in August 2012 with husband and 2 kids in tow. \\nClean hotel, friendly, courteous staff. Rooms updated and spacious. Close to all major midtown attractions. Walk to Central Park, museums, hop two blocks over to the top of 5th Avenue and hike down about 15 min walk to Times Square. \\nUpgraded to Junior Suite on our first visit and booked jr suite again to accomodate two kids on a pull-out sofa. I have been at this hotel few years ago.\\nI found new decorated rooms and flat screen TV. Rooms are quite large and not that noisy, despite to be in very busy NY!\\nIf you manage to have an high floor with central park view.....is fantastic.\\nConcierge is outstanding, efficient and friendly. \\nGreat location, close to central Park and 5th and broadway.\\nSome negatives?? the minimbar: DO NOT TOUCH IT! is an electronic system, you will be charged if you touch the bottles!!\\nbreakfast is too expensive, but easy to have it just outside the hotel. I am an SPG member gold and I was upgraded to 35th floor. What a view!! Last minute booking, it´s an amazing location because you are minutes to the park, half of block to metro and few block from time square. Quiet, elegant, refined, and amazing service Stayed here one night for wedding. Received a double upgrade as a SPG Gold. Front desk was helpful and knowledgeable.\\nJunior Suite is very spacious and well appointed.\\nNorma's the restaurant is expensive, but tasty and the portions are huge. Make sure to get a reservation ahead of time.\\nPool on the rooftop is beautiful.\\nOnly minor thing- Bathrooms are nice, but could use a few minor upgrades. Westin or Element type shower heads would be a nice touch.\\nOverall: Best Value near central park. Great Hotel My wife and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary with a trip to NYC, so when our 20th was coming up, I planned a return (surprise) trip to NYC. When choosing a hotel that was in a good neighborhood and close to attractions we wanted to take in (Times Square, ABC, the theater district), the Le Parker Meridien seemed like a great fit.\\nWe had an excellent view of Central Park from our room on the 26th floor, appreciated the friendliness of the staff from the front desk check-in to asking advice from the concierge. The \"bonus\" came when we returned to our room after supper our first night and found a nice plate of fruit and chocolate-covered strawberries along with a bottle of water and a note, wishing us a Happy Anniversary--totally unexpected. Someone paid attention to my comments about this being a surprise trip for our 20th anniversary and took the extra steps to make it special for us.\\nIf we return to NYC, I'll be sure to strongly consider staying at the Le Parker Meridien again! We booked to go to New York very last minute through expedia in fact we booked and flew the very same day! Was very lucky as when we checked in with british airways they noticed it was my birthday and upgraded us to buisness class a very good start. Once we arrived at Le Parker Le Meridien we were met by the doorman who was very friendly as it was late and we were tired/jet lagged etc.. He took us to the front desk got us all checked in and even took us up to our room showed how to put black out blinds etc and suggested we try to stay awake and have a drink in the coctail bar for at least an hour to climatise and then go to sleep. The next morning after sleeping great in our very comftable bed we headed down for breakfast to Norma's which is part of our hotel,we had the best panckes i have ever tasted they were amazing! It is in an ideal situation for the best shopping experiance you are gonna ever have! We later headed back to the hotel and went straight up onto the roof for a swim to cool off as was very hot and lounged in the sun the rest of the afternoon before heading down for a beautiful meal in the resturaunt next door which is part of the hotel. We definitley will return to this hotel on our next visit to New York! Also visit the secret burger bar for a real New York burger even the stars visit here and have signed there names on the wall this is situated behind a curtain just off reception area! I was amazed at the hotel staff, their genuine and caring attitude, especially Sylvia at the front desk, and even the telephone answering staff were so pleasant. The Meridien is clean, modern, and perfectly located...\\nI'm a W fan, but, no more.\\nI am a new Meridian Fan...\\nJean-Guy \\nCEO \\nTagga My friend and I stayed the weekend at this hotel and had an enjoyable experience. The staff were friendly upon arrival and had provided me with a larger than average room. The room was extremely quiet, had comfortable sheets and nice toiletries. Would have liked to have utilized the Dry Bar however each day they were not able to fit me in due to the popularity. Make sure to make a reservation for this service before arriving if interested. There is a beautiful cocktail bar inside and a Starbucks directly across the street. The location is unbeatable. I would definitely recommend. I was immediately put off by the front desk agent calling me \"hon\" at least four times in the five minutes it took to check us in. We booked a jr. Suite. It was a descent size but the furnishings and decor were very dated. Also a shower no bath tub. We were traveling with young kids so that was a negative. A good portion of the space in the room was taken by an entertainment center holding a huge TUBE tv. It seemed silly and out of place. We love to stay in midtown so location was great. the roof top pool was a real plus for the kids. I've stayed here before and had great experience a few years ago. I was disappointed this time and I don't think I'd stay here again. Far too many hotel options in NYC to settle for barely ok. We choose this because of the central location and large rooms, and neither disappointed. there was disappointment though that they charge for the pool - which is small - on the top floor. Also there was a lack of information in the room on hotel amenities. so we had to ask about restaurant openings etc. My husband and I recently stayed at Le Parker Meridien. Wonderful hotel, wonderful location. We had a nice room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would like to go back again, this time with the kids. The only complaint I had would be that the room had a slightly musty smell to it, but it was clean and very nicely decorated. It was very modern and stylish, and the rooftop area had spectacular views. This is my second review of this hotel. I needed a room with 3 beds and emailed one of the guest relations manager prior to my stay and she was able to secure me a Jr. Suite with 3 beds. As a frequent traveler its nice to have people at hotels you frequent able to handle those special requests you may have once in a while. The room was excellent, renovated and very spacious by NYC standards. \\nThis hotel has an excellent location great burger joint, Normas for breakfast, nice indoor pool and excellent service. You can walk to Central park, 5th ave, Rock Center and subways are lcoated near by. I have stayed at all the SPG branded hotels in NYC except the ST Regis and this hotel is one of my favorities. I look forward to coming back in a few months for the holiday season. You can read my previous review on Tripadvisor on the Le Parker Meridien and please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks This is a nice hotel with an attentive staff just south of Central Park. I was there recently and really needed a late checkout....despite being completely packed, they gave me a 5 pm checkout.\\nAn added bonus is the burger joint just off the lobby. It is always packed, but if you ave the time, it is worth it. What can I say--we got a great rate in August and it definitely was worthwhile, given the price and the location. The rooms are really small (but probably not small for New York), so if you can, get a junior suite. It's a bit more, but basically, you get another room. The hotel rooms are standard mid-budget corporate--curtained shower, smaller than you'd think bed, and typical hotel furniture. Also, no amenities are included--you pay an extra $16 per room for pool/gym access and another $16 for wi-fi. But my big complaint would be the elevators--the one time I had to be somewhere on time, I waited 20 minutes for an elevator, which never arrived, and had to run down 30 flights of stairs (in heels). Service is fine, not extraordinary. For $200-400, it's worth it. More than that, not so much. Also the lobby bar is small, and the mixed drinks are killer strong. Just be warned. I used to come to this hotel frequently and was excited to return mostly due to the gym. I stayed here for a weekend in August.\\nThe gym, \"gravity,\" has changed a lot; no more racquetball courts, now a cafe and nail salon, etc. plus a it spot of the second floor is reserved for those circuit training machines that measure slow range of motion rather than being a normal machine. But it's still a great gym, even If non-platinum SPG members have to pay $20 to use.\\nSame fees apply for the rooftop pool, which is a little on the small size for laps, but is still good enough for a short workout and apparently one of the few pools in the area. The interior greenhouse surrounding the pool was a bit of a terrarium however.\\nRoom itself was good though there was a big chunk knocked out a corner of one of my walls, which needed repair. Bathroom amenities by Paul Thomas Roth were fine but on the small side. \\nSoundproofing was pretty good, and yes, the room was indeed larger than most NYC rooms (and mine looked northward toward Central Park). Elevators are hit and miss.\\nBell desk is totally understaffed so make sure to leave an extra half-hour in there when retrieving bags. Nice hotel and outstanding burger joint :-). My preferred hotel in nyc? Our room was perfectly fitted even for a one week stay like ours and everything was handy and comfortable. The location is perfect for visiting midtown manhattan and very close to theater dist and times square. Everything is actually near once you get subway station access close to your hotel in nyc Rooms are well equipped, people were lovely to deal with, location was super convenient, and there is a Drybar in the basement. Loved my 5 night stay. Wish it could have been 10! Pool on the 41st floor was treat as well. Internet seemed a little pricey but 3G worked well. Fantastic location, close to central park, subway, 5th avenue etc. The room was a standard size room with king bed and good quality sheets, generous size bathroom with quality toiletires provided. I did find the room quite dark even with the curtains open, due to the paint colour and dark coloured furnishings and the close proximity of surrounding buildings. The service was good, friendly staff at check in, and the concierge were very helpful in providing me with directions to make my way around NYC. The cafe attached to the hotel served good quality coffee too. If you are looking for a hotel in a fantastic location, I would recommend this hotel. Accomodations &amp; guest service were all very good (with the exception of the sofa bed in the suite being uncomfortable, but aren't they all?). Location is very convenient to subways, park, shopping, and very walkable to most of Midtown. The room did get noisy during the late evening hours when they seemed to be hauling debris from the construction site next door, but I assume this is a temporary issue. Two specific items cost the fifth star on this one.\\nFirst, $15 add on charge for the pool is silly and a bit offensive. When I'm paying high end prices for a high end room, I hate being nickeled &amp; dimed. Anyone paying for a room at this hotel can easily afford the $15, so I don't believe it's there to keep the \"riff raff\" out of the pool. Just add the cost onto the room and save us the bother of having to fill out the form confirming we'll fork over the few bucks for a swim!\\nSecond, the rooms lack any information about the hotel itself, other than a room service menu for Norma's. When I inquired whether it was something that was supposed to be in our room but might be missing, a staffer explained to me that the hotel purposely does not use signage or provide informational binders in the room because they want the guests to have to interact with the staff. I must be missing something here because I fail to see how inconveniencing me in that I have to go to or call the front desk/concierge to find out basic hotel info (where is the pool, what are the hours of the onsite dining/bar establishments, how does one access the tower elevators going to the health club, etc.) is a good marketing strategy. \\nOther than those two minor annoyances, we really enjoyed our stay and would return again. I just returned from a 3-night stay at Le Parker Meridien in midtown NYC. There is no doubt the location of the hotel is great. Easy 2-7 minutes walk to 3 different subway stations (with different subway lines), and just a block from Central Park. \\nI have to take off two points because:\\n- The iron in my room didn't work. When I called housekeeping to request another one, I was told it'll be brought right up. 30 minutes later, no iron. I called again, was told it'll be on its way shortly. 15 minutes go by, still no iron. Called a third time, this time I said I will need to speak with management if it's not brought up in 5 minutes. Finally, the iron showed up minutes later. But 50 minutes to get an iron brought up, for a hotel in this class with the high room rates to match, I expected better.\\n- The elevators, though fairly fast, there's not enough of them when one goes out of service. One morning, 1 of the 3 elevators was out of service. I stayed on 5th floor. Waited 7 minutes before an elevator showed up, but of course it was full. Not wanting to wait another 7 minutes, I opted to walk down the staircase. Here's where the problem began. The doors inside the staircase are not labeled. I went down several flights of stairs and couldn't find a door with \"lobby\" written on it. When I finally opened a door, I was already in the basement. I had to find another set of stairs to make my way back up to the ground level, and exit the building. I can't imagine what would happen if there's an emergency when stair use is mandatory.\\n- Sound insulation is generally good. I couldn't hear the neighbors, but was able to hear the elevators (my room is next to the elevator shaft).\\nOther than these issues, the room is well appointed and clean. Nothing exceptional though. My windows faced a construction site, so no views to speak of. Very friendly staff, clean rooms, concierge was very helpful. Overall a great experience.\\nthe issues...the internet was down and i called and got transferred and then placed on hold and left with no one returning after 10 minutes causing me to hang up and call again just to get placed back on hold again with the company who provides them their internet.\\nthe other issues was when i checked in..american express platinum says you get free upgrades with starwood hotels. when i asked about it he looked confused and said no. i said you sure it is suppose to be automatic and he said no. He said no we don't offer it for that card. if he would have looked and confirmed it would have been nice because i was under the impressions from AMEX that you get it if available. \\nBut all things considered it was a great experience...and the breakfast was great in the hotel! The room was very comfortable and the staff was very polite. I especially noticed the sheets, which were comfortable and of high quality, and we loved the rotating tv panel. Some minor cleanliness issues with the room were immediately dealt with to our satisfaction by the staff, which we very much appreciated. Norma's is absolutely amazing for brunch, although you should make advance reservations if you plan to eat here on the weekend. Before you book the hotel, though, be aware that there are extra charges to use the gym and to use the pool, a fee to use the internet, plus parking your car is about $50 per night. These charges can quickly add $100 per night to your bill. If you are used to these sorts of charges, then I would highly recommend the hotel. I am a frequent traveler to very nice hotels in NYC, LA and Chicago, and this is the first time I have been charged for gym or pool use and it clouded my impression of the hotel. Perhaps I should have looked more closely at their web site, where I would hope they mention these additional charges. I was torn between 4 and 5 stars. But the fact that I came home relaxed, oh so relaxed pushed this into a 5 star event. The rooms are reserved. Nice not overly done. For me just right. Large for New York. LPM has its own style for sure. The staff were always helpful and great. I had a room view of the park. So worth it. Great alternative to the hustle bustle to the south. With so much food in the city I actually worked in a room service breakfast. Very good. The French Toast with caramel was created by Satan. I am still in a diabetic coma. I would do it again. Room had great wall mounted LCD. Only bad thing is there was no movies to select from. Which I think is why I was totally able to unplug. Great location. Multiple subway lines nearby. I walked the city. Good cardio for Norma's French Toast. And the park is 2 blocks away. Again great exercise opportunities. Will be back. I stayed here for 2 nights on business because my client had a corporate rate. The location on 56th between 6th and 7th is fine, close to Central Park and Carnegie Hall. There is a Starbucks right across the street.\\nThe rooms are big for NYC, although the bathrooms are tight. The bedding and towels were nice. There is a nice big desk area if you need to do work in the room. There is a minibar, but it is one of those that if you so much as touch something, you are charged for it. To me, it would be better if these hotels just had an empty fridge. There are so many drugstores and groceries nearby that you can easily (and more cost effectively) buy your own snacks. The front desk seemed efficient. My check in experience was good -- the person who helped me was very nice and the process was fast. \\nTwo issues to keep in mind: 1) The safe in Le Parker Meridien was in the most awkward position I've ever seen in any hotel -- on the floor in the closet with the back of the safe against the side wall of the closet. You have to sit on the floor and contort your body to put things in the safe. Honestly, a larger person, an older person or anyone with mobility problems would not be able to use the safe. 2) There is a major construction project next door to the west. Whether due to the fact that I was getting up early or the phase of the project, the noise did not bother me much, but it's something to keep in mind. If you want to ensure quiet, perhaps ask for a room that does not face the construction. I stayed at this hotel for a girls weekend in NYC and to go to a Broadway show, we didn't spend a lot of time is the room, if you are in NYC that the last thing you want to do! \\nthis hotel was OK, room size was great for NYC standers.\\nLocation is the best of this hotel! you are near all the attractions, walking distance from time square, central park, you have to try the burger bar, go there early for lunch! awesome burgers!\\nno real closet in the room, very old TV's very strange on a 4 stars hotel\\n Front desk staff was efficient but little bit of less rudeness will be great, check in and out was quick and easy.\\nhousekeeping service was excelent! and super friendly....\\noverall is a great hotel with a perfect midtown location if you find the right price this is the hotel for you! i paid around $150 per night so it was perfect! Love the junior suites. Great design. Nice upgrade, one of the largest rooms I've had in NY\\nLent me an umbrella in the rain!\\nBreakfast always packed. Room service expensive!\\nBar was good, pricey? \\nMy go to hotel in NYC, although pricing very variable. As a Platinum guest with SPG I travel quite a bit, and this is the worst Starwood property I've ever stayed at. My experience from start to end was horrible.\\nI booked two rooms for two nights with points, and used 4 suite upgrade certificates to ensure a good room. Turns out the certificates are a waste, as they won't upgrade anyone to a park view room \"per policy\".\\nUpon check in at noon I was told neither of my two rooms was available. My request for a park view room (noted my platinum concierge) was not mentioned at all. I asked if I should called in an hour to check on availability and was told someone would call my cell phone. t 2PM having gotten no call, I called and was told my room had been available since 1PM. I asked that a manager be available to explain when I checked in. At 2:30PM I checked in and the employee who promissed the call back was at the station next to where I checked in. I mentioned to the front desk agent that I never had a call back, and the first individual promptly claimed that my cell phone was \"busy\" and he had tried to call. All my cell phone calls are routed through a central phone system that logs all calls, and no one attempted to call my phone during the time period in question. A manager then came out, and stated that no one called me because they were still checking on the room. I asked him to explain why the other employee had a different story, and the two gentlemen began to argue. I asked 4 times that they have a general manager contact me, and was told no the first three times, but finally told someone would contact me. Another manager called me, and gave me two possible explanations but would not explain why one of the two people I spoke to at the front desk had lied to me. Starwood and the hotel refuse to comment on the matter.\\nAfter using the shower for the first time, it immediately backed up. I called down and was told someone would be right up to fix it. After more than 45 minutes no one showed up and I called again. Someone then came right away to fix it. This was after bedtime for my child, so it was quite inconvenient.\\nWhen I went to pick up my car from valet on the final day I was astounded that they wanted me to walk in the rain down the block to the parking garage where the actually park the cars. As a matter of policy the refuse to actually pull them around to the valet stand where you dropped them off. American Express agreed this was fraud.\\nWhen I initially brought these matters to the attention of the Starwood Twitter team they responded with the insulting reply “Sounds like they are really busy in NYC today.”\\nThe in room movie system did not work at all, and no one bothered to mention it at check in, or put a warning on their website. The outage was scheduled, so they knew it was going to happen.\\nIf you are expecting a real platinum continental breakfast here, think again. All the hotel will offer you is coffee and a croissant. They claim since the coffee and croissants are custom made for them, they should be considered more than enough. Don’t expect to get your coffee early on a weekend either, you can’t get coffee at 7AM.\\nAfter all these issues, both the hotel and Starwood refused to offer any credit or compensation. I spent a night at Le Parker Meridien in New York City and it was enough to see the great value of the hotel. I highly recommand it, not just for business stays but also for leisure trips. The staff was very helpful and friendly and the rooms were very clean. I had an amazing view of the central park from my room. You will definitly enjoy your stay at Le Parker Meridien! This is the second time that I have stayed at Le Parker Meridien, and it was even better than the last experience! I stayed for three nights in late July. The room was very well-designed, clean and spacious and I had a great view of Central Park. One thing I observed was that all of the staff -- the bellhops, room service, housekeeping, concierge -- were very friendly, polite and helpful. It was more noticeable than the last time I was here. This is a nice surprise in a hotel this large. I did not go to The Burger Joint or Norma's but they are both wildly popular and have great reviews. This is a great midtown hotel and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. We had a really great time at Le Parker Meridien for a 3 night stay in early August. The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. The rooms were spotless and fresh towels awaited us daily. The water pressure in the showers was strong and amazing. The Burger Joint was delicious and trendy. The Knave bar was cool too. Pricey alcoholic drinks but REALLY good espresso drinks. The doormen were friendly and recognized me every day and asked about the previous night. One night after partying, we came back to the hotel at 3:30am and I asked him where I could get food, pronto, and he pointed me to a great food cart near by. I felt important and valued so I would definitely go back.\\nThe only snag: I booked the hotel through Magellan Vacations and was told we were guaranteed a Superior Double Park View room. When we got there, they tried to put us in a non-park view and I told them that we had a park view guarantee. They put us in a \"partially obstructed\" park view room and once we got into the room, it was clear that partially meant you could see the tiniest sliver of Central Park. Also we noticed the double beds are really just twin beds. Maybe a few inches wider. I've never seen beds that size before. Tiny. So we went down and said the beds were too small and the view was silly so we asked if they had a king bed room plus a roll away, regardless of view, because we wanted more space for sleeping. They immediately upgraded us to a Junior Suite with a king and a hide-a-bed. They said they'd look for the same room with a view and we could switch for our last two nights. We ended up staying in that room because we'd sort of \"moved in\" after the first night. It turns out we were hardly ever in the hotel room to enjoy the view, so it didn't matter anyways. Even though there were snags at the check in, I don't know if it was the fault of the booking agent or the hotel, and we got a good deal in the end, so I was happy overall. The room was the smallest on the floor plan but the price we paid, given the location in Midtown and the quality of the service, overall it was a bargain. The concierge was very helpful suggesting restaurants and making reservations for us. Two of the three dinner reservations were perfect. \\nThe burger joint in the lobby also made a good homemade style burger at a reasonable price (for New York). At check-in time I was told that even thought I'm a Platinum Starwood member, I would be much happier in a king room with a park view on the 31st floor, than a junior suite on a lower-level. Not so. Starting at 6:45am, there was incessant banging and clanking -- so loud, that even my Bose noise canceling headset failed. So loud, that I needed to take a work call on the toilet with the door closed. \\nAt 7:00 I opened the blinds to find 15 hard hat wearing construction workers staring into my room. On the 31st floor! Oh, and the park is completely blocked by the new structure. See accompanying pictures.\\nThere's no way I'll stay at the Le Meridien again -- far too many excellent hotels in NYC to bother. We love the junior suite and the movable tv. It was also nice to have a dining table and chairs when we brought in snacks or coffee from Starbuck's right across the street. Staff is very helpful and knows the best way to get anyplace in NY. We got some good tips on walking trips. Can't wait to come back. I almost had to look for a different hotel for my upcoming NYC trip and it was an awful feeling. I have stayed in so many Manhattan hotels but this is my favorite. If you can get a room overlooking Central Park... it is a breathtaking way to start your morning. The fitness room is phenomenal though I don't like that I have to pay extra for it. The only complaint I had was the wireless internet was spotty, but they told me after my issues they were going to revamp their whole system. The service is excellent and housekeeping is fast and accommodatingly proactive. Its the little service details that make this hotel extraordinary. The rooms are fresh and clean and it is always peaceful and quiet. \\nThey have a \"world famous\" burger joint in the hotel that is the size of a walk-in closet, and sometimes the lines midday run through the lobby. I tried the burger and it was... a burger. love the Le Parker Meridian ~ Crisp, Polished, Refined Chic Elegance with a Fun Flair! Service is the best and all the little things are fully lined up for each guest. I particulary like the large rooms with cozy and plush linens. The Gravity fitness center proivdes a top-notch workout facility right in the hotel and offers a variety of great group exercise classes. I particulary love the morning spin class! Great location - close to the N and R lines and a quick ride to downtown. Starbucks across the street is convenient as well. And above all ~ right at Central Park. Love this place and stay here whenever i am in NYC. We stayed here with some family members for a family get together for one evening. The room was not ready when we arrived at 11 am but we were able to check in by 2pm. It is in a great location. We were able to walk to Time Square etc. There was not a coffee maker in the room but there is a Starbucks across the street. I did not find the staff overly friendly but the room was clean. Some family members ate at the Burger Place and loved it. I was surprised that all the leather chairs in the lobby were peeling. I would think a hotel of this caliber would replace or fix them. Over all it was a nice stay ...clean room....excellent location. My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights while we were in the city for a wedding. I booked the hotel through Jetsetter for under $250/night. We had a corner room 1227 which didn't have a view but was more spacious that expected. At 300+ square feet it was definitely more space than we've had at comparable hotels in NYC. We didn't hear any of the construction noise that some others have complained about. \\nAmenities were basic, bed was average, peter thomas roth bath products were a plus. They hold $100/night for incidentals so I ordered room service one morning - ended up being $30 for just a bread basket. Having the dry bar located in hotel was really convenient since I wanted to get my hair done before the wedding (and honestly this is mostly why we booked at this hotel in particular) - my blow out was perfect.\\nThe staff were helpful and efficient but not particularly friendly. They were able to accommodate both an early check-in and late check-out without any trouble so no complaints! Le Parker Meridien was a great choice for our weekend away in NYC. We saw 2 shows on Saturday and the hotel was very conveniently located to both. Also, Norma's was excellent. We ate there on Saturday and Sunday. The food &amp; service were both excellent. Our room was comfortable and the park view was very nice. The Burger Joint was fun for lunch as we checked out on Sunday. The hotel room was very quiet, well appointed, and comfortable. Great location for shows, shopping, or running in the park. Highly recommend for your weekend away in NYC. The hotel is fun, clean and provides everything you need for a short or long stay. I like the renovations to the lower level (former racquetball and basketball area). There is a gym, salon, juicebar and spa.\\nWhen will the construction in the area be done? The back entrance in impossible to find amongst the scaffolding. I think this hotel is the best value for the money in NYC. The size of the rooms and amenities can't be beat at this price. The only complaint I would have is that the air conditioning wasn't cold enough but it was probably average, I just like to sleep in a cold room. Stayed at the W-Downtown for one night, but my boss and I didn't like it and moved here. What a refreshing change it was at 2/3 the price. \\nService was a quantum leap above the W. Check in staff was friendly and was the concierge who knows what the best eateries were around the block. Have the say the guys were warmer than the ladies, who were professional but a little more aloof (both front desk and concierge). Bellhop was a bit of a rip-off. Only helped to bring the bags from cab to the front desk and took off after getting the tip. \\nLocation was much better. I was walking everywhere, even 10-15 blocks to TIme Sq for shows. Summer evenings are bearable, noon-time not as much. \\nRooms were average and dated. When I stayed here 9 years ago, it felt more amazing, But it was clean, unpretentious and functional. The shower was great. One complain is that there wasn't night curtains on the living room windows and was quite bright in the morning. Not easy to sleep in. \\nHave one of the largest gym I have seen ever, and has a very complete set of equipment, if not a little old. Only complain is the trainer who felt he had to come over and give me training tips even though what I really wanted was a quick 30-min in/out. Not judging how out of shape he was - just saying.\\nGreat breakfast / brunch restaurant at the lobby. A bit expensive but very good. A cheaper and great option is the Brooklyn Diner one block over as recommended by the concierge. Went there 3 times after. We stayed two nights with our son who is 4, in a junior suite. The entire experience was great. The hotel is very welcoming of children -- and the bellmen were especially entertaining. The room was the perfect layout (and very clean) and the location of the hotel in the city made it easy to get everywhere. The renovated lower level was so nice -- I had a fast manicure while my son enjoyed a juice and muffin from the Blue Dog. My husband thought the new workout facilities were top notch. Since my husband is Starwood Platinum, and there is no club floor, we enjoyed complimentary lattes and baked goods both mornings. We will definitely stay at the Parker Meridien again. We booked with Amex travelservice.\\nThey refuse to ad spg points to my account although i payed with my amex card.\\nthe explanation they give is that a third party (amex travel service) payed in my place!\\nWhatever!!! \\nIf this is such a problem to attribute points for a 4 digit number bill beginning with 2...well i'll stay at another hotel next time...mariott, sofitel...they don't make a fuss with their fidelity program!!!\\nit's a way of binding customers to your brand....well bad luck spg!!! never again!!!\\nThank the parker meridien!!!!! Okay, first, it wasn't a fat lady, but after a wonderful time, the last few moments in the hotel left me shaking my head.\\nI was coming into NYC with a well known person for a party, and because of previous experiences while out with him, I have literally had his fans toss me to the side like a rag muffin so that they could get close to him and a photo, and my experience with another well known hotel the week before where I was actually panhandled by a driver and badgered unrelentlessly, I with purpose called the Le Parker and specifically requested that we be placed in an area of the hotel that might assure us some privacy and they handled our request beautifully. \\nOur room was spacious and well appointed, we were never bothered by staff, and our request for an extra robe and towels was met quickly and with efficiency. Note to hotel- when 2 guest are checking into a room, it would be appropriate to have two robes available for each guest, especially with the fact that it was specifically requested that we truly wanted privacy. \\nThe staff upon check in were wonderful and allowed for a very quick check in with very little needed. The concierge was quick to provide an umbrella fir our use during the rain pour, and were kind enough to remember who I was when I returned the umbrella.\\nThe bar area is beautiful, as is the pools view. The decor tasteful, sleek with a very Euopean flair. Our mini bar was well stocked and the shower in the room was a treat for a physically tired body..... I had just commuted well over 33 hours in just 4 days and was a little beaten up by it all, and the shower felt like a hundred magic fingers releasing the stresses of travel.\\nEverything was perfect for us, as we have both stayed at the hotel before, and my last experience had left me with a headache, this one while there did not, and for him, it brought back a rush of memories of many a night there while in tour or seeing old friends and this trip was also proving to be an experience of fondess until our check out time.\\nWe had opted for the breakfast package where we could check out later, this giving us some time to relax before hurrying off to our next destination, which we luxuriated in. It was a wonderful treat to be able to do this..... but upon check out is when it became nasty and well turned a wonderful experience into one that fell short of what we would expect of a hotel of this level.\\nInstead if opting for the express check out we went to the front desk to do so. I had placed our incidental charges in cash and as we had not used anything, not even getting the breakfast that was part of the package, this should have been a very easy process. It was not. The woman checking me out was insolent, and quite frankly her behavior was unacceptable by all means.\\nI wasbnot rude, did not speak down to her, was not snippy, but walked away in complete frustion and with a foul taste in my mouth.\\nWhen I went to check out, I handed her my receipt for my deposit. She pulled up my info on her pc screen and asked me how I wished to pay for the reminder of my charges that I owed after she would be crediting my account with the 100 dollars for incidental charges. WHAT?????? What charges, we hadn't used anything, hadn't ordered room service, hadn't gotten the breakfast that was part of our package, had not used the minibar, had not purchased a robe, but yet she wanted me to pay an additional 299 dollars that she was stating I still owed. My mind was completely boggled now, I had pre-reserved the room, which also meant that I had put the room on my credit card and had already seen that the amount had been dedeucted from my account, how on earth could I owe another 300 dollars???? This went on and on and on... meanwhile my companion is beginning to get very restless and becoming very uncomfortable standing there as all of this is playing out.... and to top things off, we were checking out before the time we needed to as we needed to beat traffic out of the city so that he could make his next concert in an entirely different state within a few hours. \\nUpon feeling his extreme discomfort and my total frustration at the situation that was unfolding I urged him to go get the car around so that we could still try to make it out of the city in time, and I pulled out my IPad so that I could pull up my account online and show this woman that the room was already paid for. At this point she disappeared for an ungodly amount of time, leaving me unattended and nervously looking at the time that was passing. \\nWhen she finally returned she was still rude, which is when I explained that I had and have been a previous guest at this very hotel as well as the entire family if hotels that they have, which is when her tone dripped with sarcasm and actual disbelief tht I could have possibly stayed hee before. At that point I was fed up and told her that the way this was being handled was completely unacceptable on every level and if we had not been pressed for time I would have demanded to see a manager. \\nI showed her on my IPad my online banking account that indeed showed the room had already been paid for, and at that point she sulkingly returned my deposit and I left the hotel completely exasperated, frustrated and no longer with the fond memories of a night spent blissfully but now only concerned about my companion making his previously booked engagement and apologetic that he had to stand there in the lobby while all of this transpired.\\nAfter my last two experiences with this hotel I am truly questioning if I would indeed be a guest at this hotel again, the only saving grace may be the location and the pool and the performance of the other staff during my stay. Housekeepers were great. Room was great. Don't expect a lot of help or personality from the rest of the staff. Minibar fridge was not working, nor was the toilet. However, they fixed toilet quickly and efficiently, and provided a small fridge at no cost. I guess I was expecting more. When a concierge tells you there aren't many places to dine after 9:00 on a Sunday in New York, and that you could try looking online for Broadway tickets, you know the service is very poor. Sometimes a little service or a recommendation makes all the difference even if you are quite proficient in finding your own tickets and reservations. Dopey decor. Really great bellmen and location. We are back to the W, Waldorf or Fairmont next trip. We very much enjoyed our stay. The location is perfect, the rooms were clean as well as the entire hotel. I highly recommend this property. It's a great value too! Vivvian at the front desk was exceptional. Check out the \"burger place\" down teh hallway behind the front desk. We'll definitly book again. Excellent location, very close to the real heart of Manhattan. Extraordinary view of Central park from certain rooms: I actually enjoyed that.\\nProfessional service. Good solution for family vacation (as in my case) but also for business stays...and regretfully my business does not usually take me to NYC. For midtown hotels, Le Parker Meridien satisfies my usual requirements when traveling for business. I'm not crazy about the gym that you have to pay to use, BUT Central Park is close enough and jogging early in the morning in the park is 'ze best way to start a tiger lady's day. I also like being near Columbus Circle. Yeah, the restaurants are tasty (but pricey) BUT Whole Foods is the best way to end a day... salad bar, yo. This is a wonder to behold in and of itself. Not to mention the J Crew and Sephora for last minute clothing and beauty needs. The hotel is clean, the staff VERY friendly, the Starbucks across the street is among some of the slower services I've seen (go two blocks south or east and you'll find faster ones), but the Burger Bar is the late night, I'm-so-hungry place to grab a tasty meal.. only to run off the calories in the morning! The bar at the hotel is very lovely.. a great meeting place for a cocktail with a client. Oh, the keys are ridiculously large and you have to check it at the front desk if you want to run hands free. It's weird. But its orange so its kind of cool, I guess. I stayed in the hotel for a long weekend of shopping with my wife. I choose it because it was recommended on expedia and seemed to have a good price and location.\\nOverall, a pretty good hotel, a nice bar and rooms. It has a gym on the lower ground floor, but seemed to be part of an external chain and wasn't open when I wanted to use it.\\nNot a really cosy hotel as the lobby is wide and the receptions is a little to the side and discreet. It has a cool burger bar in the lobby but is small and packed.\\nOverall, if you are looking for a reliable quality place in a good location, then I would stay here. Due to my business i choose this hotel and i am totally satisfied with the location.Everything is done in 1 day and hotel get the credit due to the location.Thanks for staff also for the amenity sent to my room.\\nJ We stayed here 3 years ago and it was awesome, so I had high expectations for our recent trip. The hotel and service exceeded all my expectations and has even improved in the new spa facilities. This hotel is perfect for families, as they have a rooftop pool, junior suites that are partitioned with sofa sleepers and a day bed on one side, and king bed on the other, The Burger Joint in the lobby, and even cartoons playing on the elevator TVs! Icing on the cake for us was the razor scooters for the kids to ride in Central Park. The location can't be beat, and the service is incredible. I highly recommend Le Parker Meridien for any traveler who is looking for a comfortable stay in a great location at the right price! I stay here solely because my office is on 125 west 56th street- that's literally across the street, doesnt get any closer than that.\\nelevators are slow, you'll find that you will need to wait for the elevator at the lobby and when you are trying to come down. i was on the 19th floor. \\nPrice is not cheap, again I stay here for work, i wouldnt actually pay face value for a personal trip as i found the rooms to be old and small. i dont like how the shower head does not have a removable shower head, the water pressure is low. the cleanliness is great, housekpeeping are very considerate, change soap bars every other day. \\nlocation is a big plus, a block away from 5th avenue and right next to 6/7. \\ndont really have much else to say, i feel the hotel is pretty neutral, nothing great, nothing horrible, but at prices north of $350/nt for a basic room, i do expect more.\\nfood is not cheap, room service, etc - eating at norma's is expensive and three is always a wait. \\ni like how they have nice 55\" led tvs in the room, but the selection of channels is not great, i expected more espn channels, there was only 1. Was a really nice hotel in a good location. The hotel is expensive to stay but we got a good price through a package deal. My husband and I were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary with a trip to NYC and this hotel was close to walk to all the main attractions we wanted to see. The bathroom was quite small but was clean. Room was nice, again not overly big but this is typical of NYC hotels. The front desk staff were ok, not the most friendly people I've met! All in all it was great for our first visit. Would stay here again if on a deal but wouldn't pay the regular price. I've stayed in many hotels in NYC, and this was the first that didn't actually resemble a NYC hotel room (i.e. a tiny, dirty shoebox). The staff was great, room was beautiful (great technologies in it as well), and the property is in a great location. My only qualms with it were the meal I ordered ($41 for a bowl of really bad mac and cheese) and the fact that the hair dryers in the room are from the 80's and pop out of the wall. Even the Holiday Inn has blow dryers with nozzle attachments and multiple speeds, and since I don't travel with a blow dryer, I was pretty unhappy about that. What made it worse was that they make a point of placing a sign in the bathroom announcing that there's a blow dry bar on the premises, but since I was in town for work and couldn't wait for it to open (nor did I want to pay $50 for something I can do myself in 20 minutes), I wasn't able to do my hair. Not a great way to head into a meeting. All in all, I loved it and will stay again, I'll just be sure to bring a blow dryer and purchase food from the outside. My husband &amp; I travelled to NYC for a 3 night stay in July. On our first night we stayed at a hotel in Soho. It was so noisy we barely slept. We moved to Le Parker Meridien in Midtown because we hoped it would be quieter. It was and we were very happy with our stay. Andrew at the front desk was great and gave us a room on the 35th with a great view of central park. Claudia in the Concierge got a reservation at OTTO where we had a great dinner. Wonderful trip and great stay at this hotel. The perfect place to unwind after a busy day of touring NYC! Would definitely stay here again. This delightful hotel is always fresh, clean, yet makes you feel at home...but maybe that is the Orange washcloths.\\nThis stay I decided to test out the hidden Burger Joint located in what used to be the bar when I first started staying there. What a delight...had a great burger and glass of beer for $15 and then went to the bar in the lobby and had a Lemon Drop Martini for the same price--ahh New York!\\nVisit this hotel--you will love it! I made reservations, for my sister's birthday present, by phone. Agent was friendly, seemed very knowledgeable. She said this was a great gift and that maybe the hotel would do something special for her birthday. Room was put on my credit card. When my sister and her husband arrived, she was told that she needed to produce the credit card on which the reservations were initially made. Obviously, she did not have my credit card. They could not procede with the check-in until they canceled the charges on my card and billed her card. I was irate to say the least. I spoke to credit department and unless I stood on my head and jumped through hoops, the charges would stay on my sister's card. Also, the room with the beautiful view that I was promised by the friendly agent turned out to be a dud. A room with a view of construction ONLY. Nothing but a large green wall and construction workers. NO OTHER VIEW. Hotel was \"booked\" so they couldn't move my sister and her husband. Spoke with desk clerks, hotel manager, credit agent, credit manager and NO ONE was helpful. I just got fowarded from one person to the next. Never, never again. Please think twice before booking here. Great location, clean, funky rooms, super-friendly, helpful staff, fabulous bar and Norma's. You couldn't ask for anything more!\\nI have never had a better sleep in a hotel in my life thanks to the comfortable beds and quiet room. Great stay, clean rooms and friendly staff. Norma's for breakfast is a MUST! Check in was a little slow due to a computer issue but Alex at the front desk was wonderful. Location was perfect- close to Central Park, Nobu 57 where we had dinner and shopping. Did not get a chance to use the Spa on this trip but will definitely return to check it out. Traveled to NYC with family over a long weekend. Stayed at Le Parker Meridien. This is a big, fancy hotel. I'm not used to such luxuries, usually staying at the cheapest places I can find. That being said, I was surprised how smallish the rooms are. Internet costs 14.99 a day. The pool closes early. And the mini bar will cost you a lot. The televisions are very nice and the bed was extremely comfortable. Arrived late on Saturday Afternoon, Noticed building site directly outside our window,23rd floor not too impressed, no warning given when we booked, View of the park extreamly restricted. Out all day Sunday so not that bothered. Awakened early Monday by start up of building work, This was bad enough the real shock was the 50 to 60 guys in hard hats not fifty feet from our window.No draw curtains on the window, only thin nets. It was like living in a gold fish bowl. Not what you expexct from a 5 star hotel. Called the desk and the initial attitude was \" what do you want us to do about it.\" no rooms available\". After working my way up the management chain a room miraculously appeared on the opposite side of the hotel. So we packed up and moved but this disrupted our day. Another problem was no control over the air conditioning. As a warning to anyone else, If you are staying here in the near future check the room before you unpack Needless to say we will not be back.\\n SPG Gold.member The Le Parker Meridian is the best hotel to stay at with or without children. The rooms are clean and updated. What is better then cartoons in the lift. The food in the hotel is the best with the Hamburger joint right in the lobby. If you can stand the snobby waiters and poor service at Norma's its worth it because the food is to die for. The roof top pool and the great gym is also a plus. Love this Hotel it is the only place I stay in New York. For my wife's big 30th birthday, I rented a jr suite for her and her friends. The hotel staff, from front desk woman to bell men to spa people, was fantastic. Room was beautiful and extremely well-designed. Our stay was simply perfect. Friendly staff, especially Lawrence at the front desk was welcoming and fast. Clean rooms, amazing pool and central location to family friendly NYC locations like central park and fao schwarz. Fast service to get beds turned down. Loved the Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons and Charlie Chaplin films in the elevator! Will be back! For the most part, we had no complaints. We enjoyed the complementary continental breakfast (lattes and a choice of croissants) in the cafe/bar area and found the staff there very pleasant. The staff at check-in were less welcoming but it's very crowded there, with lots of people coming and going, so I don't want to be overly critical. They were pleasant when we checked out, when it was considerably less crowded and noisy. We find the location is very convenient and our room was fine. We certainly would come again and have been here several times before. This was our first stay at Le Parker Meridien but will not be the last. We came to NYC for the weekend to celebrate my mother's birthday.From the moment we walked into the lobby, the staff at Le Parker Meridien Hotel made us feel very welcome. When they heard it was my mother's birthday, their fabulous guest relations manager, Majda, made sure my mother had a room with a view and even sent some birthday treats to her room. The warm staff, beautiful rooms, and view of central park made this birthday weekend one to remember. Thank you, Majda!! This hotel is located near the center of the world’s most energetic city but, because it is on the edge of an upscale residential neighborhood near Central Park, it offers a quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. By no means do I wish to insinuate that this place is away from it all, far from it. This hotel is located within walking distance of many of the cities greatest attractions as well as some of the best museums, theaters and restaurants the city has to offer. Its close proximity to Central Park and between two of the city’s main thoroughfares (5th and 8th Avenue) makes this location perfect if you want to feel what it might be like to live in the heart of Manhattan. As for the hotel itself, it has everything you expect from the Le Meridien brand. It’s the blending old world and modern that is the signature of many of their best properties. The rooms are modern and well appointed. Don't miss the roof top pool, coffee in their magnificent lobby bar and ask for a room facing north on one of the higher floors for spectacular views of Central Park. I rate this hotel 4.5 out of 6 stars. Fantastic location, great staff, great restaurants (we usually want to try new restuarants every day but were thrilled to go to Norma's every single morning for breakfast), great room, our kids loved it, and really nice to have the pool -- though waiving the $15 daily fee for hotel guests would be a nice touch. Great location, staff very helpful.\\nExpensive drinks and food.\\nRoom ok, small bathroom. View great on 42nd Floor facing Central Park.\\nUs Brits like our tea and coffee in our room, sadly this was not the case so missed our cuppa, also no trouser press.\\nAll in All I recommend this hotel. My daughter and I spent a pleasant weekend in NY, aided in many ways by the Parker Meridian team. The hotel is sleek and contemporary, especially the room and bathroom, although the hallway on our floor was a little worn. The staff was quite helpful in recommending restaurants, transportation, and even suggested a place to jog. The pool facility, which was a major attraction for us, was lovely although in the end we didn't swim. Location was excellent, within walking distance of Central Park, Times Square and Broadway, and midtown East and West. It was a decent value for a NY hotel. I would definitely return and also recommend it. Great location, very friendly and welcoming staff. nice room, nice pool. Great place to visit with a young child! Just returned from a long weekend in NYC. My daughter and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien. The location was perfect, the room was immaculate (each day) and the front desk staff was extremely helpful and accommodating. The nightly room rate was more than reasonable for the value we received. We would stay here again ... and again. This hotel is in a perfect location, a few minutes walk from central park, several subway lines nearby, and only about 10 mins walk to Times Square.\\nI paid extra charge for a 'Park View' room, only to find a large crane in the centre of my view outside my window during my stay (no warning or mention of this by staff at check in desk!). Building work which was about 10 floors below my 33rd floor room and started before 7am each morning, (on the positive side it helped me to be up and out enjoying NY early!) They built 2 floors during my 7 day stay....so I wonder how much longer the view will be there for? Also a very tall thin building opposite, to the left of my room, had just gone up, not very attractive concrete with orange mesh around it, still internal building going on, so more noise! The view was still good - straight ahead beyond the crane, my room was lovely, clean and spacious, and as i was out most of the day building work didn't really spoil my stay too much, but if you are looking for a lie in - don't stay here! \\nThe most annoying thing about the hotel were the charges for the use of the pool $10 (or $15 for two in a room) a day, and also the same charge for use of the sun deck to sunbathe, I can't believe they charge this on top of high room prices, most disappointing since this was the reason i chose this hotel over others nearby, and there was no mention of this charge in any of the hotel information at the time of booking. There is also another $15 charge for use of the gym. Thankfully Central Park was so close and free!\\nI don't think this is a very 'tourist friendly' hotel - there was not a shred of information in the rooms about the City/area, or even about anything in the hotel (eg pool, gym, room service etc), for that matter! No kettle (I had read the reviews and took a travel one) and no fridge - but there was an ice machine down the corridor, which they don't charge for - yet. Generally the hotel seemed to be more geared to buisness/conference guests or people with so much money they didn't need to think about the cost of anything in advance!\\nCertainly a nice hotel.....but not sure if i would recommend it, even when the building work is over, because of all the hidden charges. First let me start by saying that this was the first visit to NY! We selected the Meridien based on feedback from a friend. Andrew at the front desk was great! he had a great attitude about him and was very helpful. The rooms were just as expected....very clean and cozy. I would recomend this hotel to anyone! Looking forwad to my next visit, and for sure will stay st the Parker again! Thanks for a great experience! This is an overpriced hotel, but what isn't in Midtown?\\nThe rooms have a scandinavian decor that is to my estimate at least 25 years old and in need of complete renovation. Stained rugs, patched ceilings, old TV set, worn counch, you name it. I stayed in a junior suite with the shower big enough to hold six people but there is no bathtub, and not a single hook or towel rack large enough to hang anything larger than a face towel.\\nThe best thing i can say is the staff are very nice. Central location. Calm and quiet. Helpful, courteous, knowledgeable personell. Clean room, very well appointed. Very comfortable bed. Loved every minute Stayed here for 7 nights with my daughter. Hotel was comfortable and clean, staff wonderfully friendly and when I had a problem with the air conditioning someone came and sorted it within 10 minutes! Room service prompt and good. We loved the pool &amp; sun deck and had a couple of meals up there. The location is superb - 20 mins from Times Square &amp; Rockafella Centre, 2 blocks from 5th Avenue shopping and Central Park - lots of supermarkets, eating &amp; drinking places and feels very safe. Would definitely recommend for a 1st trip to NYC! I've stayed at many, many hotels in NYC. Not only was this hotel super clean, the rooms were very spacious and comfortable. And despite the construction across the street, it was pretty quiet, as well. We were traveling with our baby and it was just perfect. Stayed there for a week-long NYC vacation with the family (including 2 boys 6 and 11). Place is very kid friendly and the location can't be beat.\\nThe Knave bar was very nice for some late night drinks. Norma's was OK but it is too fancy for kids. There is a Dean&amp; DeLuca practically across the street which was very nice for breakfast, although there are also many other choices up 7th Avenue.\\nIt was a little noisy at night (it is NYC after all) and the bed quality wasn't the best, but everything was very clean and fresh, which is not always the case at NYC unless you're willing to pay big money. checking in lacked continuity,in terms of one receptionist checking us in and the extremely arrogant Edwin denying we were checked in and implying were were not even booked, despite me spelling my name twice. he eventually agreed we were checked in but changed my wifes' name.He handed us our keys with a rude and patronising comment that ruined the start of what we hoped was to be dream holiday.\\nWe found his attitude dreadful. Although the hotel is to be commended generally, our perceptions were shaped by this initial very poor experience. It is all about location, location, location and the Parker Meridian is the perfect location for a NYC trip. It is close to everything. The Parker is a good, classy hotel. Attractive building, smart and well-kept rooms, that has somehow managed to avoid the reverse facelift and smudgy purple-blue lighting of so many Meridiens that now look like seedy small-town nightclubs.\\nService is OK - not stellar, but adequate for New York.\\nThe bar is very nice. This hotel is at two blocks for central park and some blocks to Times Square, so it´s the besto option to stay. The rooms are very confortable (big), the bathroom is a little small, but is find, is very clean everything. The people from front desk it´s very kind, also de concierge. And these hotel has the best burgers in New York at the lobby, the space is small and most of times you have to make a line that goes fast. I´ve been in many hotels in these city and It´s the best option to stay at New York Le Parker Meridien We stayed at the Parker Meridian during one of the hottest spells of the summer and it was very comfortable and yes the air conditioning worked. However, what they are not telling everyone is there is major construction on this site and the cranes start at 8am. This was a major noise issue in addition to the already noisy NYC streets. I found the room and bed very comfortable and I liked the shower, but they could improve on the amenities and at a minium have free water. There was no wi fi in the rooms. I really like the location of this hotel next to my favorites, Stage Deli and Rothmans Steak house on 54th and Madison. It is very close to the park and I found the staff very friendly and the security was excellent. I would stay away from this hotel until the construction is finished or demand a room away from. My fiance had a big event there the week we stayed and I was really surprised that they put us next to the construction and did a minimal room discount after her company had spent so much on their investor day. No bueno in my view. I recently traveled to NYC for business and spent 4 nights here. This was actually the second time I had stayed at this hotel, so I knew all about it already. As most of the other reviews have indicated, the location is unbeatable. I was able to walk wherever I needed to go - both for business meetings, and for dinning out at the huge assortment of great mid-town restaurants in Manhattan. The lobby is simple, subdued but modern in design. The hotel has a very unique burger bar off the lobby (behind a curtain). And there is a breakfast only cafe. There is also a bar. The atmosphere was very 'hip' but not pretentious. The place does have a unique personality. There are TV monitors in the elevators that show old black &amp; white movies and classic jazz performances. The room I stayed in was a junior or mini-suite. It had a nice sitting area with couch, coffee table, a built in bench under the big window, a desk with a nice Aeron chair for working and a TV set in a swiveling cabinet. The cabinet can be rotated so the TV can face the sitting area or the bedroom area. My room was on the street side of the hotel (facing south - 56th St.) and I was on the 17th floor, so there was no view to speak of, since the buildings across the way and surrounding are much taller. My understanding is that you need to be on a higher floor (although the elevator only indicated 22 floors) in order to have a view, and you need to be on the north side. The room was modern and comfortable. Spacious enough that you could spread out. The bed was a very comfortable king. The last time I stayed here, the first room they gave me was near the elevator, which was noisy, so I requested a room away from the elevators this time around. I found the valet staff, bell staff, front desk personnel and the concierge to be very friendly and warm. For travelers away from home, that kind of service is always important. I will be back to NYC on business again this year, and intend to stay here again as well. First ever trip to New York was made so much easier by staying at this hotel, it is close to all the major shops, Central Park and Times Square.\\nThe room was spacious and bright, air conditioning was used 24/7 as it was 95 degrees during the day and 85 degrees during the night and being British we were not used to these sort of temperatures!\\nBathroom was spot on, nice big mirror and will lit, shower was lovely but a hand held attachment would have been nice.\\nThe desk chair was asbolutely fabulous, having a bad back from all the walking and sightseeing and then sitting down in this chair was such a relief :)\\nStaff were very helpful and many thanks to Lourdes on the cleaning crew who left us a personal message wishing me and the wife a happy anniversary, this sort of personal touch was welcome.\\nThe TV could ahve done with on demand films/tv but it was more than big enough though.\\nThe reception staff and concierge staff were first class every time.\\nThe Burger Joint sell the best burgers ever and Normas comes a very close second.\\nWould recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone Stayed for a week and loved the food at Normas and the burger joint. Also loved the location is to die for. The room was large but the bathroom is tiny. We had a view of central park. Fantastic. Stayed here on business in June for a week. Perfectly located for the shops on 5th avenue and central park. The check in was super swift which was great but the service experience thereafter was poor. Got woken up twice by the laundry service calling who were asking questions about my cleaning and the maid service did not clean my room to 5 star standards and my shampoo disappeared. we really enjoyed the parker meridian. It has a cool, funky atmosphere yet is great for families. Located just north of times square, south of central park and west of 5th avenue, it gives you great access to many of the tourist spots. My wife and I booked via a conference agency, to stay for 8 days June-July 2012.\\nWe visit New York approximately every 2 years for work, pleasure and to meet with family and friends.\\nWe requested a refrigerator and a non-smoking room. We were not warned of the absence of what, in retrospect, we would expect as standard guest facilities.\\nAt check-in, we were not given any information regarding the functioning of the hotel, there was no room guide, we were warned (by the bell-hop) not to move the contents of the in-house beverage cooler as removal of any item, even if replaced, would be automatically added to our account. We were told that a refrigerator had been supplied. This was placed in the middle the wall of the room.\\nWe were not warned that our \"Central Park\" view room also had a full view of the skyscraper height crane immediately outside our window, which operated from 6.30am-3pm except Sunday. The rooms do not have adequate sound proofing to block the continuous noise from the crane motor. It is true we were offered a room on the other side after complaining about not being warned at check-in, but re-packing is no small task and my wife declined. There appears to be no customer relations response, as there was no contact made to see how we were faring. There was no mention of staff assistance with any proposed move. At least the crane did not work at night.\\nThe room was adequate without being luxurious, the fittings reasonable, the bed and pillows comfortable cleaning service timely and good. The toiletries are average. The window blinds do not provide sufficient black-out and daylight intrudes even earlier than building activities.\\nClothes storage space is sub-optimal for more than one person. The room safe is awkward to access if there are objects inside the closet. The TV is large, flat screen and HD but seems to offer only limited cable TV without an apparent menu of other entertainment available. Fortunately this is New York, so we were not dependent on the in-room entertainment system and its limitations.\\nThe absolute absence of any added features e.g. in-room coffee making facility, news-paper delivery without cost, $10/person daily charge for gym use (I paid and attended the excellent spin classes on 3 occasions) , $15/person daily charge for pool use, $17.50 for internet use (ironically free to passers-by in the lobby who are not in other ways contributing to the costs of running the facility) , not to mention the absence of included breakfast of any sort, was disappointing when compared with our previous experience with Le Meridien properties. In our opinion, it marks the establishment as having a management which judges its clientele as exploitable. For example, additional services for laundry were, risibly, well above those of the local laundry about 100 metres away, the quote for a car to return to JFK 4 times higher than publically advertised car services or hailed taxicabs. \\nThe experience has resulted in a decision never to use the property again and to caution friends and relatives visiting the area, to seek alternatives where some of the additional services such as internet are provided in the basic tariff.\\nAs the hotel had already been paid for, via the conference agent (the conference rate being the same as is available on the web-site to any member of the public), there was really no redress for any of these issues. However, at check-out, I was presented with an account which included a $40 daily charge for the refrigerator, totalling $320 for an $80 item! I explained to the staff member that I had been told it would be $11 daily. She needed to leave the desk to see her manager to deal with this. Given our previously articulated dissatisfaction with the room noise and absence of additional services, this particular issue confirmed our assessment of the property and its management policies in relation to its clients and since the tariff is about the same as for many other properties in the area, a review of the cost-benefits of the current guest facility policies might be considered. The location is midtown and it is near Central Park and very close to Times square and all the touristy stuff your little heart might desire to see. I loved being able to walk to the MoMA and Central Park. It was also a lovely walk to all of the 5th avenue shops as well.\\nThe hotel appears to be in a state of renovation of some kind. Our first room was totally modern and upgraded. I loved our lovely view of Central Park. Unfortunately we were unable to stay in our room the second night because someone had rented out our whole floor. We were then moved to the exact same room a few floors up. Unfortunately that room was not upgraded and I did not like it nor did I want to stay in it. However, when we complained to the front desk they were super-helpful and moved us. We ended up getting upgraded to a junior suite, which was nice. I appreciated the effort that the front desk put into making our family happy.\\nFrom other reviews people seem really annoyed about having to pay for the gym and the pool. It's $10 and you're already paying a lot for a hotel room so... Also you can pay $15 for a gym/pool combo per room. That is seriously not a lot of money, and the pool has a beautiful view of the park. The basement of this hotel is also seriously cool. It has a spa, a blow dry bar, nail salon and a coffee shop. Best little underground cluster ever.\\nLast but not least, it also has a cool bar and of course Norma's restaurant. Room service was also quite tasty.\\nStay here if you are looking for a nice hotel in Midtown :) We just completed a weekend stay at Le Parker Meridien and EVERYTHING was excellent. I was astounded when Priceline gave us this extraordinary hotel for what was, in New York City terms, a fairly measly bid. Then I read reviews about construction noise, etc., and arrived mildly anxious.\\nTurns out the experience was exceptional in every way. No street noise whatsoever. Frigid air conditioning with near-100 degree temps outside. A friendly and courteous staff. Of course, a location to die for. An ultra-spacious room far exceeding our expectations. We have stayed at the nearby Hilton several times, this was a much better experience.\\nI hesitated to write this review because it would result in higher Priceline bids in the future. Oh well, honesty has its price. My wife and I stayed here for a quick 1 night getaway in December 2011. We also stayed here the previous December as well. Both of our stays were very nice. We had a very nice modern park view room. The location is perfect, we walked to the tree at Rockefeller center during the day and then walked to Lincoln center at night. You are in the middle of Manhattan so there are obviously good restaurants everywhere around you. We had lunch at Bar Americain and dinner at Rosa Mexicano, both were very good. Previously we had eaten at Burger Joint which is in the hotel (fast food) and is real good as well. We loved the Le Parker Meridien. The conceirge staff were all very helpful as we were new to the city. It is conveniently located to Rockafeller Center, the Yellow and Blue lines on the subway, Central Park, numerous restaurants and walk-in deli markets. The coffee in the bar downstairs is amazing and our boys both enjoyed haircuts in the vintage looking barber shop in the lobby area. The rooms were spacious enough, but the beds were only double beds, not queen size. Nicely decorated, but queen beds would've been better. Very popular breakfast/brunch restaurant and a separate popular burger restaurant downstairs as well if you don't want to venture out. Nice place! Very Nice 4 star hotel, the bar, gym, spa are 5 star but comes at a price. We had Sunday brunch at Normas...Great Burger just off the Lobby... really cool bar.... breath taking view of the city from the roof top pool. We will be back. My sister and I spent three nights here in late June. We were in NYC to see a show and the Meridien's location was perfect. Right around the corner from Time Square, the Theater District and Central Park. We were able to walk to just about everything we wanted to see. Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. A beautiful lobby, the beds were comfortable and the room was scrupulously clean. The wine at the cocktail lounge was overpriced (it was actually cheaper to drink the wine in the minibar) but the wait staff was awesome and they do capuccino right, so I was happy. The only complaints are that the charges for WiFi and for the use of the pool are exorbitant. WiFi should be complimentary these days and so should the pool, but if you must charge, make it reasonable. I will definitely stay at the Meridien when I go back with my husband. The first time I came here was ten years ago. Returned not to be disappointed. Certainly there have been changes, but none that interferred with a comfortable and pleasant stay. I was pleasantly surprised. Fairly large sized room for NYC, was able to fit the whole family in a double with the fold out couch. Went to the pool on the top for the kids and since it was during a snow storm, was pretty cool to watch the snow fall while they were swimming. Also used the gym and had a nice work out. Starbucks across the street, diners on every corner and Central Park around the corner. Plus if we really had a desire to get to time square, a quick walk down a few blocks. Quite enjoyed. had a great experience at the Parker. Right next to central park, Times Square, Rockefeller center, and all the legal offices in Manhattan. Lots of great food and entertainment places within a short walk. Fun bar at night and great breakfast options right in the hotel. Had an amazing time. They catered to our needs.. Very helpful. Was there for our 25th wedding anniversary and had a great time. The poll also has one of the best views of central park. I stayed here for a night on business as I continued to try new hotels in the NYC area. Upon check in I was immediately upgraded to a suite. The room was extremely comfortable. The furnishings could use some updating as they are extremely dated (tube televisions, old sofa and bed), but still the room was clean and spacious. Especially compared to rooms at the W and other hotels in the area, the room was extremely large. If you are looking for a normal hotel experience versus the \"shoebox: new york hotel this hotel did not disappoint.\\nThe lobby is large and very grand which creates a different feel then other hotels. That being said hotel gets a lot of traffic which makes it feel like more of a tourist hotel then one for business travelers, but it did not detract from the stay.\\nThe gym was probably one of the largest I have seen of any hotel in the area. That being said it was kind of weird that you have to sign and authorize payment, but for the size and options its worth the $10. For SPG platinum members that fee is waived which is even more of a bargain.\\nI would recommend this hotel for others, especially if you prefer space. We had a staycation and spent a night at the Parker Meridien. As an SPG gold member, I was granted an upgrade to a room \"with a great view of Central Park\". All we saw was the massive crane doing construction on the building next door. Kind of a let down. Service was very good, otherwise. Room was spacious (compared to other NYC hotels we've stayed in) and very comfortable. great location for museums and theatre, loved having Starbucks and Dean and Deluca across street. Would have liked little Cafe for before or after theatre snacks. I atayed at this hotel for 4 nights this June with my daughter and friends on a site seeing trip. The hotel was mostly filled with business people. As mentioned by previous reviewers it is a perfect location for Times Sqaure, Fifth Avenue (Aberrombie is on corner of the block, Central Park and mueums. The hotel itself is reasonable for its price and I chose it as we are SPG members. Our King room on 26th floor was nicely appointed with flat screen TV and was in good order, huge desk at window and great view over central park two blocks away. As mentioned by previous reviewers the bathrooms are small but the room was larger than expected for NY. Bed was comfortable with lots of pillows.\\nWe didn't eat in the restaurant for breakfast as we were told we would have to book but there are diners and Starbucks on every street around the hotel so this was no problem adn much cheaper. The Burger Joint is very good but not at all waht we expected in a hotel, you queue at the counter to order and your burger is paper wrapped like a take away but cooked perfectly and full of lfavour, recommended. There is a pleasant but unusual bar area where we had drinlks one evening, its very Spanish in style and service was good.\\nWe didn't find the staff friendly on reception but they were efficient, I would stay here again and would recommend it. This hotel is perfectly located in NYC. It is blocks from Times Square, 2 blocks from Central Park and 2 blocks from the fab shops of Fifth Avenue. The hotel itself is modern and clean and reasonably well appointed. The standard king room comes with a nice sized flat screen TV and a comfortable desk area. My complaints about the room are a) There is no dresser in the room, so drawer space is extremely limited; b) Too few hangers in the closet (fixed with a simple phone call to the desk); c) The bathroom is a bit small for the price point - at least compared to other cities; d) the thermostat can only be controlled by the front desk (how about training your housekeeping staff to reset the room temp when they clean, instead of forcing the guest to contact the desk to change the temp??) Otherwise, the staff are extremely friendly, the hotel restaurant, Norma's, delicious and the lounge nicely appointed. If you're looking for a nice, reasonably priced (by NYC standards) hotel with a great location, this is it. I've never been to this hotel before but I do travel a lot and stay in Hotels for my work.\\nI can say that this is one of the best I have stayed in and the Staff,the rooms ,location and the ambience did not let me down.\\nNo leaky showers ,No cables hanging as mentioned elswhere and I look for this stuff much to my Wifes annoyance. I inspect the safety of electrical installations for a living so it's always a Busmans holiday. The place has a good vibe with cheeky humor. Huge desks (along the window) make it a fantastic option for business travelers; the restaurant Norma has deservedly an excellent reputation for unusual breakfast options (think red fruit risotto and artichoke eggs benedict with truffle porcini sauce) - but its popularity means that esp. on weekends you may not get a table without reservation. The commercial gym in the basement is very nice but the $10 usage charge per visit was unexpected. Bathrooms are OKish - not big, shower tub for shower, no shower gel. The location of this hotel is great. True, it looks like a construction site at the moment, and you should enter off 56th St not 57th St to avoid this. The room was a bit worn down and could use a freshening, but it was clean and spacious. Not the best hotel in NY by any means, but very adequate. Beware: wi-fi costs a lot of money at this place. We have stayed at this hotel probably at least 10 times. It is very convenient to a great number of \\nNyc attractions . We have stayed at some of the cities other fine hotels before , but continue to\\nReturn here. We have stayed at this hotel many times in the past and used to really enjoy it. It has been a couple years, but remembering it as a fun and cool place to stay, we decided to stay there this past weekend. The location is great, but the hotel itself was really disappointing. As Starwood Gold members, we were upgraded to a high-floor room overlooking Central Park. The view was great, but the room was very tired and dated. The hotel rooms are in serious need of renovations. The bedspread was stained (I just pulled it off and left it on the floor the entire time), the walls were very scuffed (I am not the type to \"look for\" stuff like this, but it was very noticeable) and the swiveling console that houses the tube television (no flat screen) ate up so much of the space in the room we had to negotiate ourselves around it. The decor is really starting to look tired. Even the bed, which is usually a selling point to Starwood properties, was pretty uncomfortable. I thought it was just me until my husband commented how uncomfortable it was. Having spent a fair amount of time in NYC hotels, I know not to expect huge rooms and bathrooms, however our bathroom was so tight that the bathroom door just about grazed the toilet and sink as I was closing it. Getting in the bathroom and closing the door required maneuvering yourself around the sink and toilet. I'm a small person and I could barely function in it. Even the lobby, which used to be fun and hip, was lackluster (although \"The Burger Joint\" is still a great place to grab great burgers and fries). When my husband and I went to use the pool we were told there was a $10 fee per person, per day to use it. There was no mention of that fee anywhere on the website or paperwork we received. We used to enjoy staying at this hotel, but will probably not be staying there again in the future. Our visit to Le Parker Meridien was again, great. The hotel and rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable. Just wish the pool wasn't an additional charge. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room service food was excellent. Concierge dinner recommentations were very good. The beds were comfortable. Very good balance of value and service for NYC. Only downside was elevator wait at a peak time on one day of my stay. We recently stayed at the Parker Meridien after having not stayed there since it became part of the Westin chain. The hotel has really been upgraded and the accomodations were excellent, much better than when it was an independent hotel. We would heartily recommend this hotel. As a SPG Platinum, I really appreciate the warm welcome and room upgrade that I received at this mid-town hotel. They have an impressive attention detail, with systems that allow them to remember my favorite newspaper and other preferences. The burger joint is consistently wonderful and the concierge staff knowledgeable. Another great stay at the Parker Meridien. Well run, comfortable, and convenient. Solid and dependable! First class service from check in to check out. Very nice rooms, bar is outstanding with Teresa running the show. One thing you might want to avoid is breakfast at the restaraunt, HUGE portions and it takes a bit longer even though the service is really good. If they offered a smaller quick service option it would have improved the overall experience. I had a great stay at the Le Parker Meridien. The room was actually a suite (don't know if all are), with nice furniture and lovely wood detailing. Good shower, not great. Bed was very, very comfortable. As far as I'm concerned, though, what makes this place special is the penthouse pool, with amazing views of Central Park. The pool is open long hours, has a sundeck, and you can order food, which is just great. I didn't check out the gym, but I hear its pretty great, too. A few minor gripes:\\n(1) Get HDTVs in all rooms, please\\n(2) I couldn't access the wifi network in the lobby\\n(3) The restaurant should open for breakfast before 7am.\\nWhen all is said and done, the positives far outweigh the negatives, and when you consider the price (I paid $450, which in midtown Manhattan is rare), this place is a freaking home run, a much more luxurious option than similarly-priced options like Sheraton, Hilton, or Doubletree. Pros: Good location with entrances on both sides of the hotel and located across the street from a Starbucks. Plenty of restaurants and Central Park within walking distance. Service was good helping me resolve billing issues. Beds and noise level were fine as well. \\nCons: To turn down the blinds in the room we had to jump on the desk to reach the cord. Don't move anything in the mini bar or they will charge you. The burger place downstairs was overhyped as well. Pricey and bland. My husband and I made a joke that they were happy meals. They accept cash only, no credit cards. \\nOverall it's ok. Nothing that was horrible but nothing that was awesome either. I'd like to check out other hotels in NYC when I return. We had a wonderful experience, with attentive service, and staff that went above and beyond. The hotel is extremely well located, within walking distance to Broadway, find restaurants, a bus tour stop, and the subway. The room was large and very clean, with a magnificent view of Central Park. Although construction noise could be heard from rooms closer to street level, on the 35th floor, it was very quiet. The manager had beautiful desserts sent up to our room when she learned it was both mine and my daughter's birthday. It was a thoughtful touch. I recommend you don't eat at Norma's for breakfast- the prices are astronomical ($9 for a glass of juice, $25 for an omelette), and the food is nothing special. The only thing lacking is the gym, which is large and well outfitted, but is in the basement which is dark and cave-like. But with all of New York to explore by foot, who needs a gym?! I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for three nights enjoyed it very much. I have been visiting once per year for the past ten years and I look forward to spending my time there each year. If I hadn't met Maurice the Bellman at my arrival and then again during my departure, the hotel might not get the rave reviews for friendliness, although other staff were polite and professional, Maurice is the ambassador with the golden touch for Le Parker. I was concerned booking this hotel because my 2.5 year old daughter was travelling with us. From the moment I stepped out of my car, Maurice was there assisting and caring for us. He really was remarkable (and understanding of what it's like to travel with a child) which made the check-in experience happy and welcoming. He connected with my daughter and had her laughing and cheerfully distracted after a long car ride. Amazing! I wish I could replicate it.\\nThe room was comfortable and spacious (for a NYC hotel), and we had outstanding views of Central Park. I love the central location of this hotel. We used the pool which was crowded but definetly family oriented. In fact if you don't have kids with you, you may wish to avoid the pool.\\nRoom service was prompt and the food was above average, albeit on the pricey side.\\nI enjoyed the modern granduer of the hotel and thought that the cartoons in the elevators were fun and added to the hip vibe of the place. Le Parker is hip, but not in an snobby way, it seems there is a place for diversity and many kinds of people.\\nWhen it was time to leave, we were so lucky to see Maurice again. He came to help us with our bags and my daughter became so enchanted with his warmth and genuine concern that she insisted on holding his hand as we walked through the lobby. What a sight this was, and Maurice was kind enough to oblige my daughter in this request. I will come back to this hotel because of Maurice and the good feeling of care he encouraged in me. There are so many choices in NYC, and when I originally booked the hotel, there were several venues in the running. What a relief to have chosen the right place for my family where we felt truly welcomed and cared for, and not just \"another\" guest. I stayed at Le Parker Meridien one night in early June, with my daughters ages 8 and 4. I liked the location, close enough to broadway and times square without the crowds and noise. Plus we were able to take an early Sunday morning stroll in CP before starting our day. We booked an oversized room, which was roomy enough for 4, with a double bed and a sleeper sofa plus a regular sofa, table and desk. Great closet space (although we didn't need it.) Cool TV set up -- mounted on a pole and swiveled 180 degrees.\\nAfter taking the girls to Shake Shack and Lion King, we headed back to the hotel for a dip. I was surprised by the $15 charge to use the pool. It definitely felt like being nickeled and dimed. (Want a fridge?, we can give you one, but it will cost money.) Room service was astronomical -- $79 for hotcakes and an omelet with 2 glasses of juice. Fortunately, we had 2 breakfast vouchers that were included in our room price and they covered the bill.\\nI was pleased with the nearby cheap parking. (Not at the hotel, of course, where they wanted $63 to keep my volvo overnight.) Used a garage on 56th between 7th and 8th for $35 all in. (Search online for coupons for QuikPark.)\\nI think we will try a different hotel on our next trip. Great location, big rooms (by New York standards), clean and modern, delicious food both in Normas and room service. Got the park view room and it was an amazing park view. I could see all the way to the Washington (I think) bridge. Made the room feel really spacious. Didn't have my kids with me, but thought it was a great New York property for kids because of the location near the park, Time Square, 5th Ave, rooftop pool and room service menu had stuff for kids like pizza and mac&amp;cheese! It was trendy and stylish, but not overly noisy or so trendy that I wouldn't bring kids. If you want to eat breakfast at wonderful Norma's make reservations. Have stayed here twice since I am a Starwood member and love this hotel. It's away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but very convenient to subway options and attractions in mid-town. The lobby area is great and the nice bar and hidden burger bar (behind the red curtain) get great reviews and are nice to have so close to your room. Another plus - the shower pressure in the bathroom was great. A lifesaver for a weary mom who flew the redeye solo to make a friend's wedding. I've stayed at the Le Parker Meridien several times but it's been awhile. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The bellman are very helpful and knowledgeable about the city. We upgraded to a park view room and the view was amazing. We would turn off the lights at night in the room and just sit and stare out the window taking it all in.\\nI like that they have a Dry Bar close by or you can have them come to your room for a little extra. If you are going out to a show treat yourself and have your hair done. Love it!\\nThe hotel is very kid-friendly. My son loved the coloring book they gave him at check in. We also used the pool and had dinner delivered there for my son. He was in heaven. The only downside is that they charge a little extra for the pool. Not sure why. But I won't complain about that. This is my first time at Le Parker Meridien. Our room, which was a standard room, was spacious, although the bathroom was quite cramped, and there is no bathrobe. The hotel has cute little signs all over, such as the minibar sign, which says something like, \"a minibar not a fridge.\" The hotel has trendy things like a blow dry bar, and they play Tom and Jerry cartoons in the elevators. I went to the bar for a snack, and it was dark, and there were only three choices, hummus, caprese sticks, and a cheese platter. \\nThe location is great, and near shopping, etc. It is just trying to hard for me to enjoy. Just completed a three-night stay for our nephew's high school graduation. As others state, the location is terrific and we were delighted with the park view from our 39th floor room. Bathroom is small (and I wished they provided bathrobes at the price) but room was good-sized and modern, and the free wi-fi was a big plus for us. We also were tickled by the vintage TV (cartoons, a jazz performance and even part of a Chaplin film) shown in the elevator--a smart idea since the rides from our floor could be long, with frequent stops.\\nBreakfast at Norma's was an experience: Bring your appetite because everything is over the top. I had the lox eggs benedict which came with at least half a pound of lox heaped on the side (first time I ever got a doggy bag for breakfast). I've also heard good things about their burger joint.\\nThis was definitely a splurge for us, but as splurges go it was certainly worthwhile. If you want spectacular central park views a tower park view room in this hotel is a must. Room amenities are what you would expect from a high quality mid town hotel. My only complaint is the large CRT TV unit in the bedrooms which feels a bit dated &amp; cumbersome for a hotel of this standard, but the other qualities of the room, amazing park views, rooftop pool and roof sun terrace do make up for this. Good high quality contemporary hotel. Husband is Starwood Gold, so that played into our experience. Room upgraded, to 33rd floor, fantastic view of Central Park. Room was very large, had everything you could need and seemed to be in decent shape (bathroom was a little tight). Location is very central to anywhere you'd like to go. Parked car, very easy, only 10 minutes to retrieve. The staff was very nice, very service oriented. Would absolutely stay there again. I had a pleasant 3 night stay at the PM. I chose to stay here because I had really enjoyed the PM in San Francisco. The hotel is in an amazing location just south of the Park, and close to all the shopping and restaurants you could want to visit, as well as Time Square, and Radio City, etc.\\nWhile the staff was extremely friendly I did get turned down for a request for a room on a higher floor (75$ surcharge). I was under the impression that the hotel had recently been renovated, but my room was only average. While nice and tidy it was tired looking - from the water stained popcorn ceiling, to the mildew in the shower, and shoddy bathroom fixtures.\\nOverall I would stay again due to location, but would hold out for a better rate.\\nPros:\\nLocation\\nThe Burger Joint hidden away behind the lobby\\nFriendly Staff\\nCons:\\nRoom condition could be better (especially bathroom) Our most recent trip to NYC was made all the more fantastic by a warm \"welcome back!\" at the Parker by fine front desker Laurence. Before we could ask, he upgraded us to a beautiful parkview room, where we had close to a perfect experience for five days and nights. As I wax effulgent, I realize I could be hired by the PM's PR people, but believe me, when the experience is less than perfect, I say so (see my scather on Miraval.) Mohammed the bellman was a sweetie who always had a warm smile when I walked through the lobby. And the Frenchman at the desk when we asked for a late checkout was swoon-worthy as well as warm and helpful -- an added treat! Allright, there is a small bone to pick: the hostess at Norma's, the fine brunch resto in the hotel, was cool and unaccommodating when we checked to see whether we could walk in and eat. Mind you, this was a Saturday, high season for a spot like Norma's. Nonetheless, she could have been nicer, suggested other places in the area to eat, etc. As at any place we stay around the world, it is axiomatic at the PM: when you're nice, staff respond in kind, with very few exceptions. As a clinical psychologist, I can't help noticing that, when I read negative reviews about hotels on this and other sites, the lowest ratings are from those people whose extraordinary level of narcissistic entitlement virtually jumps off the page. Simple kindness and a good attitude speak volumes to those in the hospitality business; most people in the service biz are grateful and more than willing to return the same when treated like human beings. I look forward to a return stay at the Parker! We stayed here for 7 nights. Everything was perfect: location, staff, food, rooms. Some of the best burger I´ve tried at the Burger Joint, which is ´hidden´ in the back of the lobby. Also had a great brunch at Norma´s (reservations are a must). Staff very friendly and great service. The concierge helped us out with any question we had concerning recommendations, reservations and general tips. Would definitely go back here on future trips to NYC. Le Parker Meridien hotel has a great location that' about it , \\nThe service is very slow ,the food is decent, \\nI have stayed at the parker few times and i was amazing with the combination of the luxury and simplicity , Something has changed: Employees are miserable.( I think the hotel is under a new management ). it feels like i checked into a hospital not a hotel, Hotel = Hospitality \\nPS: The double beds are very small We stayed here on our second trip to NYC, and it was great. close to Central Park, the Lincoln centre, ant Times Square..Nice clean room. I liked the classic cartoon videos in the elevator.. And the rooftop glass enclosed pooll was awesome, with a view of central park..We walked a lot sightseeing and a hot tub would have been nice to soak in, but they didn't have one, my only disappointment.. The famous Russian Tea Room was only a few doors away, and handy for the theatre after dinner. they served an interesting breakfast, expensive but nice. we'll be back for sure...... My nephew and I recently stayed at the Le Parker Meridian and we booked the hotel based on comments from previous travelers and the response from Lisa at Guest relations. I was impressed that she took the time to answer almost each response whether good or bad. But let me tell you from the moment we walked into the lobby till the day we left we were treated like royalty and I see they do this to everyone as I listened to travelers checking in or just asking questions as we walked thru the lobby. The employees clearly love working here and it shows. The rooms are really nice and the beds are comfortable. I thought our room for two was perfect with an awesome view of Central Park. Bathroom was perfect size and the restaurants to die for! The Burger joint &amp; Norma's are well known to both tourist &amp; locals and offer amazing food! The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect within walking distance of many sites. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and can promise I will return soon! Location was great, the welcome outstanding and everything was perfect for a long weekend \"sisters\" getaway. I've stayed here several times and like the hotel's style, \"cool modern\" rooms, and splendid location. Breakfast prices -- even by NYC standards -- are a shocker! $80 for two coffees, one breadbasket and two glasses of OJ (the waiter's welcoming \"May I pour you some coffee and orange juice\" somehow neglects to mention that the juice is $9 per glass!!). I recently stay at the Parker Meridien, check-in was flawles rooms were small and tired, but it was clean comforable and very good gym. I also enjoyed the bar and my wife loved the dry bar! A wonderful hotel with a very big room, very clean, very friendly staff. I will never forget my stay there. The hotel is situated in one of the best places of NYC, it is one of the best hotels I´ve ever been to - and very convenient. Breakfast is very good, too. \\nNot cheap, but it is worth its price. I booked a junior suite for an overnight stay and was really surprised at how big it was. The room had tons of closet space and nice amenities. The service was really good too. My nieces loved the roof on the pool - warning there is a $15 room fee for using it. We had dinner at the pool and the food and drinks were reasonably priced. The location was perfect and close to everything. I would stay here again. I stayed at this hotel because I was attending an event that was being held there. Here are my thoughts.\\nThe good:\\nThe hotel was clean as you'd expect for a hotel of this class. The lobby area was nice and the lounge area was decorated very well. We didn't order anything so I can't comment on the food or prices. The internet service was fast, which is always hit or miss at hotels, but it was not complimentary. The service fee is just over $16 per day for internet.\\nThe water pressure in the shower was excellent, both in force and volume. Felt like someone was pouring a bucket of water over your head (and I mean that in a good way).\\nThe bad:\\nThis section is longer unfortunately. First off, the beds in the room and the room itself was very small. I suppose they were technically double beds but they looked like just slightly larger than twin beds to me.\\nNext, we were on the 11th floor and our room was directly over construction on the building next door. They started promptly at 7am each morning and it was quite loud, too loud to sleep through.\\nOn the last night of our stay, we decided to go for a quick swim in their pool which was open until 10:45pm. We got there at just after 10pm and were told that there would be a $15 per person charge to use the swimming pool (!). I've never heard of this at a hotel before for registered guests, especially when the room rate was well over $300 per night. Even though we only had maybe 30 minutes of use for that day, the attendant said that was the policy. I was less surprised that the pool was empty after hearing that. We left the area disappointed and went back to our room.\\nWhen we checked into the hotel, they couldn't find our name on the event list so we booked in at the standard rate rather than the discounted event rate. The difference was $29 per night and we were told that we could get this resolved when we checked out and could show that we were part of the event. Ok no problem. Upon check out, I asked about changing the rate and the clerk said she wasn't able to make any changes to the rate. I explained the situation and showed her my credentials for the event, but she still would not help us. She went and talked to someone and came back and said that they couldn't find my name on the event list which of course we already knew as they told us this when we checked in. She said I would have to contact the event coordinator (whom I don't know or have any affiliation with) and that person would have to then contact their sales department and then possibly they could do something. I was told this after she made me wait almost 30 minutes.\\nBoth of these incidents underscored my feeling that customer service is not important to this hotel. This could have been resolved very quickly in both circumstances by reasonable people who were willing to treat customers as they should be treated, but instead I was basically told to go away. Well, I hear you loud and clear Le Parker Meridian. There are many other hotels in Manhattan and based upon my experiences here I cannot recommend this hotel to travelers. My wife and I stayed here and were very pleased with the location and ease of access to the rest of the city. Before we left for NYC we looked up great places to eat lunch, and it turns out the #1 burger place is in the lobby of Le Parker Meridien. Its called the Burger Joint. Great food. I think I stayed more than 5 times in this well located Hotel. Over the years I noticed that no further investments have been made (but prices stayed rather on the high side). In my perception the attractiveness of the hotel suffered a bit. Rooms are used and the stylish flair of the 80s is not so timeless anymore. Sure, the hotel is still well located in the heart of Manhattan, sure the fitness center in the cellar is nice and sure the breakfast place is excellent but still the thrill is gone. Let me caveat by saying I'm a SPG \"Gold for Life\" and have stayed in every SPG property in Manhattan, even some that are no longer SPG (e.g. Essex House, etc). So please take it seriously when I tell you that the Le Parker Meridien really lets itself and the Starwood Franchise down significantly. \\nI'm going to start with the \"Cons\" here, because these stand out the most\\nAt check-in I noticed the Front Desk staff's daily info. sheet on the desk which prominently read... \"Upsell, Upsell, Upsell\" Which makes sense, given that I was told \"we never offer free upgrades even to SPG Platinum and Gold members\" (ummm ok, I didn't ask for one, but thanks for the info).\\nElevators - Don't fall for the \"view\" or high floors - You will be waiting 5-10 minutes for the elevators, which will be completely full. Also, you should know that this building is part residential and the good views of the park are typically private residences. Avoid the upper floors... you were warned.\\nI reserved a junior suite, which at a mere $600/night, was hoping it would be suitably appropriate. It was horrible. It was smaller than most hotel rooms I have been in and is in serious need of an upgrade (you know those popcorn texture ceilings from the 70's... well that is what you get and is probably the last time this place as seen a renovation).\\nThe gym is in a really dark basement (which was formerly the boiler room) it is spread over two floors and there is not a window in the entire place. Additionally they painted the place black and put in really dim lighting... which makes absolutely no sense if you are trying to get a burst of energy in the morning or evening... also they charge to use the gym (think it was $10.00/time).\\nService - Inquired about getting a small tube of toothpaste - \"sure, that will be $10.00\" which seems odd, given that I stayed at a Sheraton the night before in Nashville and they not only gave it to me for free, but brought it up to the room with a smile. It's the little things i guess.\\nThere are all these signs in the room (which try to be clever, but just come across condescending). \"This is a minibar, not a fridge! if you want a fridge one can be provided at an additional charge. If you move any items you will be charged instantly and this will not be reconciled at check out as we will need to investigate.\" Seriously?... at $600/night you should bring me a subzero if I asked for it, and quit being berating and condescending with all of your signage all over the room. Just poor.all around.\\nI generally give hotels an opportunity to respond or try and make things right before putting bad reviews on here. So.. i asked to speak to a manager upon checkout, and was told\" there would not be one available for 30 minutes\". I also wrote to the hotel with all of these comments, to which they responded. \"we are sorry, let us upgrade you to a junior suite next time\" (ha ha... that's ironic... given that I was complaining about the state of the \"junior suite\" in the first case).\\n\"Pros\"\\nLocation is decent, but if I were you, and wanted to be close to the park, I would try the the London Hotel, Sheraton Hotel &amp; Towers, the Trump, or the Hudson. (Something in there for everyone).\\nEmma's for brunch is good, but they have no alcohol license so bloody marys are going to be virgin\\nThe secret burger joint is fun and decent, but go off peak and probably order two as they aren't massive burgers (and I wouldn't wait in line an hour for it). Room adequate, although very small. Norma's 7 the burger place were very good; the lobby bar has wonderful physical attributes (ceiling height, effective use of mirrors and very enjoyable background music. Over-all good value but able to move up with a few room improvements. I was pleasantly surprised by Le Parker Meridian in many ways. Great location, well designed and appointed rooms, excellent staff-no disappointments. I strive to find great fitness centers, and this one is very well done. They have a diverse array of fitness classes including yoga, spinning, and cross training which was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommended for those wishing to stay in shape while in NYC for business or pleasure. The hotel is clean, hip and contemporary. Love the secret burger place inside, and the breakfast restaurant is outstanding. The room was a fantastic value for its hotel class and location in New York City. Best of all was the totally state of the art GRAVITY gym. One of the only hotel gyms I have been to that rival the best private stand alone gyms. Free weights, cardio and machines galore. I will definitely be going back Just wrapped up a quick business trip in NYC where I stayed at the Le Parker Meridien for one night. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. Front Desk attendant, Laurence, was personable and professional upon check in; he upgraded me to a junior suite based on my Gold status. \\nCheck in was easy although I'd recommend additional representatives during peak times to get things moving faster. Check out was fine. No issues with elevator wait times. Very clean, location was great (close to Central Park and shopping), and the bellmen were pleasant to deal with. Also, when I noticed that there were no complimentary bottles of water in my room for Starwood Preferred Guests, I inquired about it to the front desk and was told to have an Evian from the mini-bar on the house... that was a nice gesture and is something that shows me that the hotel is focused on delivery quality customer service. I would stay here again.\\nBTW, although I didn't dine hear this time, earlier in the month my wife and I enjoyed a great brunch at Norma's which is located in the hotel... it's a quite popular higher end brunch venue which is a hotspot for the locals... portions are gigantic but also healthy... quality is excellent. I am all for second chances. In a previous review, I gave LPM in NYC a less than stellar rating due to air conditioning problems on a hot an humid week in Manhattan. This time, on my return trip to this hotel, I was ensured that this issue had been resolved, and it had. I was in The City for an honorary dinner for some of my work, and had other plans as well. Therefore, The Parker was to be my home away from home. I used every feature the hotel offered, from early swims in the pool (arrive early, lap swimmers, as the pool becomes an area for children later in the day), to workouts in the gym (very nice by Manhattan Hotel standards). Top ratings on all counts for that portion of the hotel.\\nThe staff were perfect. As a resident of the New York City area (and a former resident of Manhattan), I am not in need of over the top friendliness. I view this behavior as disingenuous. No need for faux niceties. On the other hand, I do require professionalism and assistance when called for. This is exactly what I found on this trip. From the customer relations staff, to the bell staff, all check-in and check-out procedures were handled quickly and efficiently. Exactly what is called for in NYC. I had the car I had called for waiting for me when I left one morning, with a friendly umbrella loaned for an extremely wet day. I had cabs called as soon as the door-man recognized me walking through the 56th street entrance. He even became used to my destinations and informed the cabbie for me. This is how a door-man should operate.\\nThe restaurants: The Burger Joint (or whatever moniker it is being called these days!) offers a very nice, no frills burger. Fries are decent and the shakes are above the standard. Lines were long, so I arranged a lunch brought to my room, and it was there in 15 minutes. Perfect. Erma's (sp?) was great for breakfast and the Moroccan (I hope that was the theme they were going for, as that is exactly what it reminded me of) themed bar on the 57th street entrance was especially nice for drinks, especially one night when I got in past 1:30 am. Oh, and the patrons were especially easy on the eyes, for those of you who need something of that nature.\\nAs noted, room service was efficient and quick, and the food was certainly above par for that matter. I am of the mind that delivered food loses something, and have had room service at The London and The Mandarin, roughly in the same area as TPM NYC and this food was just as good if not better than those two, which boast high end restaurants. For the times I ordered, I always kept it simple and was not disappointed. \\nFinally, the location speaks for itself. Great. The room was simple and high quality, in my estimation. Clean and recently renovated, I requested a no bathtub room, as I wanted a large shower to relax in (I enjoy the extra room this offers...). \\nI did not enjoy the spa, but did make use of the barber for a trim and shave. Excellent. 'Nuff said.\\nAll in all, a quality stay worth the value added price. I would recommend this hotel and will be staying again. Le Parker is a great hotel, in a good part of town. Grand entrance hall, but a little hard to find from 56th street. Room was on 73th floor with views over central park. Maybe for the price some of the decor could be updated. Staff OK, not super friendly. A good pleasant stay. We needed a get away... New York City for the weekend. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else. Clean and contemporary. Two blocks or so from a horse drawn carriage ride through Central Park, a short walk to Times Square and Fifth Avenue shopping. The Hotel is ideally situated, and makes a number of attractions easily acccesible. The rooms, while nothing spectacular, were cerainly adequate. The staff were very accomodating. We needed to change our room, and this was accomplished without a problem. For our iinconvenience, the Hotel provided us with a bottle of Evian water, and a fruit platter.\\nThey granted us an extended checkout time, again without any static. My first stay in New York and amazing trip! If anyone has ever dreamt of coming to the big city then do so - dont let anyone or anything stop you (I had to save 5 years and went on my own but it was worth every penny!). The hotel made it for me - comfortable, quiet, helpful (to a point, NY staff are always quite 'to the point' although the girls on the gym reception and maids were lovely), perfect location (just a stones throw from central park and Tiffanys/fifth avenue and much better than staying in the thick of it as I got a perfect nights sleep which geared me up for the day ahead). A fab trip, a fab hotel, fab TV in room, very clean and decent gymnasium The location in central Manhattan with proximity to Central Park, subway stations, tourist attractions and shopping places is the best part of the hotel. The rooms are very spacious for the location and very comfortable. Service is good. Pricey hotel, though considering its Manhattan location. One thing which could improve things is to install a coffeemaker in the rooms. Fantastic hotel in the heart of the city, 10 minute walk to Time Square.\\nRooms clean and of a good size, ours with great view over Central Park (upgrade).\\nAll the staff were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful.\\nHad a couple of drinks in the bar, which were expensive.\\nNormas for breakfast...........brilliant. Stayed here 5/25-28/2012 on vacation. The hotel was conveniently located near Central Park and had a subway station nearby for traveling to Times Square, etc. Room was large, quiet and very clean. Several Duane Reade grocery.pharmacy stores were within walking distance of hotel. Would definitely stay here again. The hotel reception is very effetient and professional. Hotel breakfast is awesome, the best egg benedict I ever had. Hotel Spa is excellent. So many hotels in NY and this is one of the good ones where so many are a disappointment. Nice and close to Central Park, 5th Avenue, Bloomingdales and lots of good restaurants a few blocks away. Comfortable rooms which were good size. Building site next door creates noise from 7 am. Charges introduced recently for swimming pool are unwelcome. Some of the public area furniture needs attention and updating. Our room did not have good soundproofing as next door TV could be clearly heard, also noise from elevator.\\nHotel was chosen with great packege through BA and the location was perfect ie 2 blocks from our daughter. Spent 5 nights here with my family. Got guaranteed connecting rooms! Almost unheard of anywhere else. Rooms were roomy with a decided lack of storage. Noticed one room had an umbrella but ours didn't. We had two glasses but they had only one? Recently updated and adequately comfortable with the exception of lack of control on temperature. loved the burger bar, Knaves lounge, and the ultra expensive and delicious Norma's. Most of the concierge were quite helpful, but ran into some condescension, hey I'm from the sticks and don't understand mass transit. Only real gripe is when we showed up at 3:30 they said our 2nd room wasn't ready? How is this acceptable and what were you willing to do to compensate us? Never got an answer. great family weekend. staff was very accommodating. totally recommend. Perfunctory front of house staff and at times condescending. Very good location. Room on eleventh floor trying to hip-boutique without carrying it off. And if you are trying to be hip, lose the dated and huge tv that didn't work properly, and give your guests an iPod device. So, to set the record straight, they have not addressed the tvs and no DVD player. Usual offer of exhorbitantly priced PPV movies, which in the digital age is crass. Concierge guys outside the hotel, and helping with baggage were all a delight. Team working on the bar were great. Overall, great location, confused and even slightly cheesy concept that is laughably trying to be something else, very good standards of cleanliness, service nioticeably variable by department team. room was really nice, location is great near by train station and walking distance to the central park. staff was friendly I've already reviewed the hotel, but wanted to update since on my recent visit I learned that the hotel has made the leap into modern times with the addition of the new flat screen TVs! Yay. The staff is always friendly and the rooms are very clean -- and you can't beat the location. My one disappointment thisntime around is that the Internet went down right when I needed it the most. I also think the Internet is kind of expensive ($16+). The hotel is very clean and very high-end. But, it's one of the noisiest places we've ever stayed--external construction work until midnight each night, very metallic doors slamming (think college dorm slams), loud hallways, and lots of kids. Our staff person at check out was VERY rude too. The hotel is in a great location, just 2 blocks from Central Park. Very clean with small but nice rooms. The location makes this hotel a great place to stay. $40 for a family of 4. Not only it's probably the only hotel in the world that charges for its pool, but there's no disclosure whatsoever of this highly unusal charge on their website, so they get you when the kids are tugging to go. This hotel added LOTS of magic to our NYC getaway! We arrived at LeParkerMeridien by subway from LaGuardia. Easily accessible if you don't have a problem riding public transportation. There are several subway stations within a 5 minute walk from this hotel. I must add - our hotel reservation was made 6 weeks in advance using a govt employee rate - huge savings! Within 24 hrs of making the reservation, a hotel employee called us to tell us that the room that we had reserved was a \"handicapped accessible\" room. They had a family that needed the room and if we would be willing to give the room tho that family - they would upgrade us for FREE. We quickly agreed. \\nOur suite was HUGE!!!!! King bed, 2 sofas, office desk and a spacious bathroom. FINALLY - finally, a hotel that READ our reservation - 4 people in the room - and they made certain to have enough linens for every single person! Wow! A+\\nCheck-in was seamless, in spite of long lines and a very large wedding party that crowded the lobby. \\n2 heating/cooling units in our suite. Temp was perfect - if you need ANY temp adjustments - you must call the front desk, none of the units are adjustable and are all pre-programmed. When I felt too cold - I just turned the units off for a few hours. Bath products were by Peter Thomas Roth - indulgent and luxurious - be prepared to take very long showers! Housekeeping was impeccable. The room was clean and updated. 56th St was closed our first night, so there was no traffic and very little noise outside. \\nThe rooms do not have coffee makers or refrigerators - but there are plenty of coffee shops on every corner. Plenty of clothes storage for 4 people. Safe in the room for our iPads, iron, blow dryer. \\nBeware! The use of the pool is extra $$$!!!!! They do NOT advertise that $15/day, but it was a bargain for 1 day. The pool is located on the top floor and ALL should experience it! You are on top of the world! The view of Central Park, East Side, West Side, and Manhattan - you feel privileged just to be there. The pool is tiny, but their facilities are updated and clean and they try to indulge you. They provide towels, goggles, and swim toys. There is an observation deck from the top floor you see it all! Empire State Bldg, Central Park, and many many many more iconic NYC buildings! \\nCheck out is 11am, but we called the front desk and request a late check-out and they painlessly gave it to us - for FREE. \\nThe hotel staff does not share secrets or tips - so ask them about anything - even if you fear being labeled an idiot. The staff was a bit indignant but you quickly grow to accept that in NYC. My tips: book early, visit the pool, acquaint yourself with the hotel's 57th St exit/entrance - saves you time and energy! My husband and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 3 nights in mid April, before leaving on a cruise. The location of this hotel couldn't be better. Never being to NYC before, we were able to see the highlights very easily from the hotel and walked everywhere with no problems. I had booked the AAA breakfast rate and wow, what a wonderful breakfast. Terrific choices and great food, which the rate also covered the tax and tip, which is unusual at other places we have stayed. Would highly recommend this property for a stay in NYC. Thank you for a great start to our cruise. This is a great property due to the location. Service and almost everything else was okay. Rooms are dark and sparsely furnished. I realized I forgot a toothbrush and called the front desk... They told me that they do not have toothbrushes and that I would have to come down the gift shop and buy one. $10 later I had a tooth brush. Hampton Inn's even have a toothbrush for guests who forget. As an SPG Platinum member this was disappointing. Overall for $400+ per night this is an average experience. You are paying for location and that is it. Great location, clean rooms. As I was travelling with my two teenage children, I reserved two rooms, one room specifically with two double beds. When I arrived thay couldnt accomodate the room with the double beds and could only offer me room on two seperate floors which required us to go to the lobby to take a different elevator every time we wanted to go to each others rooms. Additionally, they charged my credit card for $800.00 to cover room incidentals. While this is apparently normal practise, they failed to advise me of the amount they were charging and it did inconvenience me later when I went to use the card. A half hearted apology was all I got. Thank god my bank was much more accomodating. I enjoyed my stay at this fantastic hotel! The service was great and the Le Parker Meridien was a nice place to come home to. I was in New York working long hours, and I needed a quiet room on a high floor to escape to at night. The front desk clerk gave me the perfect room and housekeeping kept the room spotless! I would definitely stay here again! Love the location. I only had 24 hours in NYC so I took the full advantage of the location of this hotel. I was able to spend a couple hours at Central Park, went to the Guggenheim museum and then attended a symphony at the Carnegie Hall at night. Had a brunch at the Burger Joint and Lobster roll at Lukes. Still had plenty of time to catch my flight back to Chicago from EWR. As a SPG platinum member, I've got upgraded to a Junior suite and it's perfect for a solo traveler like me. I have stayed at multiple Ws previously when I was in town, but the stay here at LM was much better. I like the contemporary and sophisticated (but unpretentious) decor (except for the old TV ;) and the services are excellent. I'm glad that I didn't see/meet any snobby associates at this property!! We spent 10 nights here in a Junior suite and would recommend it to anyone. The room size is excellent and VERY large for New York and the hotel location is central to everything. We'll certainly stay here again and again. After many trips to New York and staying at a different hotel every time I have finally found one I will go back too. You can walk to Broadway and the shows in 5 minutes or Central Park or 5th Avenue in the same time. Even a Starbucks right across the road ! The positives are obvious: This is great location, right by Carnegie Hall. By NYC standards, the hotel is \"small\" and feels more intimate than many others. We did not need any unusual service, but were pleased with the staff's responsiveness in general.\\nHowever, there are two negatives, how important will depend on your needs and temperament. First, this was probably our first and only hotel experience ever when there was no coffee in the room. Who feels like dressing up and going down 35 floors at 6AM just for a cup of coffee? Second, complimentary wifi is limited to the lobby and is not offered in the room. Most unwelcoming if you need to check or send email early morning or late night. \\nOther than these two \"Soviet touches to customer service\"---coffee is a normal human gesture offered by most hotels, and in this day and age wifi is not some exotic technology but part of infrastructure on par with electricity and running water---we were pleased with our stay. \\nTo summarize, we will consider this hotel again, but will also look around for other good hotels that do not add such edges to the experience. 1 night stay but excellent throughout, from rapid checkin and checkout to a clean, spacious, well designed room and friendly design touches throughout. Love the cartoons on the screen in the lift - bye bye CNN! We were here exactly 5 years ago, this time we book through a booking service that got us a room upgrade (view of the park). Everything was clean, the room safe did not work, and we were not around long enough to wait for security to come up to the room and fix it.\\nThey could use new tv's---they are still using the same ones from our last visit. Coming from Chicago, the cost per night was reasonable. If you want to go to NYC, you need to be ready to spend $. The new tv's are a great improvement, it's a shame they didn't do more with the refurb. A top hotel deserves more that a curtain across a cupboard in place of a wardrobe and the safe is mounted on the floor with the door opening towards you so you have to get down on hands and knees ad crawl into the cupboard to get at it (coupled with an internal light that stays on for 5 seconds - I timed it). The room was lovely and clean and a great sized tub in the bathroom with nice quality toiletries. I used the gym twice a day and it's a shame that there is a charge even if it is only $10 for the day. Overall a good hotel and well placed geographically. Everything was flawless about my hotel experience - from check-in to checkout. It was great. I would definitely stay again. We stayed for my daughter's 8th birthday trip. I had never stayed at Le Parker before, though I've known of its good reputation for many years and even worked right down the street from it for a long time. Before the trip, I emailed to ask if perhaps a card or balloon or somesuch could be delivered to the room for my child's birthday. Instead, we were delighted to receive an upgrade to a Park View room, which was absolutely gorgeous, and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and other fruit delivered to her with a birthday card! I thought this was truly going over and above my request, and I appreciated it tremendously! The front desk staff as well as every other employee we encountered was pleasant and in many cases effusively kind, which was lovely given that sometimes in NY hotel staff can tend toward being curt. We consider Le Parker M our new go-to NYC hotel and look forward to many more stays.\\nI have only two complaints: the elevators are quite slow (once it took my husband 15 minutes to get from our room on the 36th floor to the lobby), and the staff at Norma's restaurant was very aloof and disinterested in us as customers. We took my daughter there for her actual birthday breakfast, which we had hoped would be special based upon the reviews we read, and we were treated very indifferently. I had hoped for kindness and perhaps even a \"happy birthday\" said to her, but we received neither. The food was delicious, although much too plentiful and overpriced even for NYC, but we will not return due to the staff at the restaurant. I was very impressed. The staff is excelent. The location is perfect. I will definitely come back on my next trip to NY. I spent 1 night here on a date with my wife. There are plenty of nearby parking options and the hotel is located quite close to Central Park South. The hotel area is appropriate for a touristic visit to the City. Hotel check-in was quick and efficient. Our room was large by NYC standards and well appointed. Overall, a very nice stay. Nice upper mid level hotel in a good location. However some of the rooms are showing there age; also no coffee maker in the room and really expensive internet ( why do hotels marketing themselves as upper end insist on massive internet charges when almost every budget hotel has free internet--it seems that the more expensive the average room the more the more the hotel thinks it can charge for wifi). Some of the upper floor rooms have a great view of central park.\\nService is good but not great, the Burger joint is good but not worth the long lines that it sometimes has.\\nJust an OK value Good hotel ... has everything except a bar. If we could just get a bar here its an even greater place. Convienient, happy , no drama, good service, fantastic gym , hairdressers to die for for quick blow dries ( book !) hamburger spot is great.. just wish i could have a glass of wine that's not in the hallway.Staying alone as a woman you don't want to go to a stranger bar and having pounded the life out of NYC .. i needed just one. OMG Norma's ... top ! We enjoyed our recent stay at the Parker Meridien. We were in a Jr suite which work well for 3 of us (2 adults and 1 child). We liked how we could turned the TV around to the living area or the sleeping area. We had breakfast at Norma's (very good) and the Burger Joint (very good too). I liked how the Burger Joint is hidden behind the huge red velvet curtain. My husband and daughter went to the rooftop pool but didn't stay too long as it was a little crowded. The Hotel has a great location, walking distance to most midtown attractions and the subway stations are within a 2 blocks. Would stay here again. The location of this hotel was our first choice. Upon arrival, the first person extending his warm welcome was the bell-hop (an older man), then the front desk staff who were friendly, courteous and professional. The room was clean; bed sheet and pillow case were fresh; the bathroom, toilet, tub were clean. The house keeping staff were courteous, smile while greeting us in the hallway; they did a great job in keeping the room clean. The hotel staff's attitude made our stay so much more enjoyable. My last review was middle of the road and my biggest complaint was the old TV and the poor TV reception in the room along with the long waits for the elevator.\\nWell they are finally upgrading all the rooms with flat screen LCD's and the reception is much better. When I checked in, the guy behind the counter made sure I got a room that was upgraded which was nice and he put me in a handicap room. I'm not handicap and didn't request this and my only complaint was the sink was too low in the bathroom but the overall size of the room was much bigger then room I had during my last visit. \\nEven though I was on a lower floor, it still seemed like the elevator was doing awhile to come down to the lobby even though it didn't seem that busy. Don't know if all the elevators were in service or not but until I don't have to wait 5 min in the lobby, i'll keep this at a 4 star rating. Everyone was friendly and helpful and the room was nice and clean each night that I got back.\\nWill def stay here more often even though it's slightly further from the office then the Sheraton down the street that I usually stay at. Nice hotel, great location, very friendly staff from housekeeping, bellman, concierge and front desk staff. Rate was good and I got upgraded to a junior suite due to my Platinum status. Title says it all... Very nice hotel, great location for midtown Manhatten (close to everything without having Times Square on top of you). I would stay again, but I had a couple of niggles...\\nFirstly, I found it surprising that a 5 star hotel charges to use their pool - this is the first time in my travels to 30+ 5 star hotels that a charge is levied for pool access. Locally, I have stayed at the Mandarin and the Penninsula in NY and neither charge for pool access - it seems slightly 'tight' and this impression was reiterated slightly later in our stay.\\nSecondly, the hotel is also not prepared for infants - which surprised me. Having travelled to St Lucia, Copenhagen and Australia in the past 8 months with a baby in tow - all the hotels that I stayed at have thoroughly supported infants; sterilizing bottles (microwaving the bottle container), providing fresh boiling water and in one case providing freshly pprepared baby food for free (this wasn't even a child friendly hotel). When I first asked at the concierge desk, they were somewhat baffled and then started suggesting that it would cost $10-20 (penny pinching for boiled water and microwave usage). Ultimately, one of the waiting staff was very helpful and providied the microwaving service and the concierge desk provided both a kettle and microwave (which unfortunately was too small).\\nBut, to reiterate the point that the hotel could be far more prepared and endorse people with infants. Providing a bad experience to parents now are likely to alienate them and is very easily communicated to other parents through online networks and even tripadvisor.\\nIn the end, all worked out well for us and so i would recommend again. As an SPG member I wanted to stay in one of their properties on my first trip to New York in March. Le Parker was close to where we would be visiting (Lincoln Center, Times Square, etc.) and had good ratings. Plus we were going to use points. At first glance, I wasn't sure about the quality. Having never been to New York and relying on the SPG website and TripAdvisor for advice, it \"seemed\" like a good choice, but who knew.\\nCheck in was quick and we were treated quite nicely. Lots of hustle and bustle, but we still felt taken care of. We stopped by the concierge for some quick questions about dinner choices before the Met Opera performance that night. He was great (which allowed me to call him later) and set us up for the Lincoln at Lincoln Center. A perfect choice for a wonderful evening.\\nWe got up to the room and it reminded me of the hallway and rooms in \"Lost In Translation\". I love that movie and I loved this room. Lots of unique things including a swiveling television tower, great woodwork and curtains, lots of closet space, lots of built-ins, floor to ceiling mirror, and a really comfy bed. It felt like a room in someones house. It was cleand. And I loved the view. While you could only see a thin slice of Central Park, there was a ton of other stuff to look at. Very comfy.\\nThe best part was when we were getting ready for dinner and the Opera. I had brought along instructions on how to tie a new bowtie, but couldn't quite make it work. I called the concierge and luckily got the one we had talked to earlier. I coyly asked if he knew how to tie a bowtie and he quickly offered to come up and and help. Just a few minutes later he was in our room helping me out. He was incredibly nice and never made me feel stupid or treated my like a hick from Kansas.\\nOur visit was way too short: I could have stayed a week. One cool encounter: On our way out the door the next day we spied Charles Barkely in the lobby. THAT was awesome. I was upgraded to what seemed to be a junior suite with more closets than my own place. The TV stands between the living room and bedroom and swivels where I want to be. It was very nice to sleep in the comfy bed. The darkening curtains close off the early morning sunlight...a must for a restful sleep. The windows are sound proof, since I was not disturbed by noise produced by overnight trucks. It was delightful. While we booked one of the more modest rooms at Le Parker Meridien -- the staff never made us feel anything but welcome and went out of their way to help us in every aspect of our stay. The room was excellent - clean, modern, and comfortable with an extraordinary view. The hotel's proximity to Central Park, the MOMA, and the Alvin Ailey theatre made it an ideal location for us. Though our stay was only 24 hours -- it felt much longer in a very rich and positive way. We would recommend this hotel to all of our friends. It is well located for midtown. I stayed 10 days in this hotel and I was in a junior suite. The room was very spacious and clean but as in many hotels not a lot of light inside. \\nThe beds and pillows are comfortable although my main problem was the constant street noise and the noise of the air conditioned at night. As a previous review has suggested maybe they have the original construction windows. \\nThe hotel is quite pricey for no additional free services such as Gym, breakfast, Wifi…… \\nSo a mix review that has to resukt in an average score. \\nHighlights: Concierge service and Burger Joint in the lobby. Could be this one of the best burgers you ever have? So here's the nitty gritty:\\n-The hotel rooms are clean and spacious by NYC standards. I had a nice view of central park. No qualms there. The TV is an old tubeTV - not a big deal as I rarely watch it. If you just want a place to lay your head down thats clean and has a comfortable bed, this works.\\nHere's where things go sour:\\n-This hotel will typically cost you between $400 - $700 depending on the season and the night... more or less... (I paid around $450)... I get there and I'm ready to get a swim in at the pool before my meetings - they inform me that they now charge $15 to swim in the pool (that was free 3 months ago).\\n-Then I decide, ok fine - maybe I'll go hit the gym... well, there's a $10 or $15 charge for the gym in the hotel... this is getting silly.\\n-So I call downstairs that evening as I'd run out of toothpaste in my travel kit... yep, you guessed it... they said \"Sorry sir, we have toothpaste in the gift shop that you can come down and purchase....\" ... the motel 6 will help me out if I forget my toothpaste...\\n-The next morning I wake up and realize I forgot my razor and needed a shave - I call downstairs, yup, same thing.. \"Sorry sir, you can come down to the gift shop and purchase a razor....\" you're getting the point here.\\n-During check out, a colleague had to fax a document to me - she kept getting the run around as to what number to fax to, and who to fax it to... long story short, after about 45 minutes... no document - the staff was confused... so I left and went to Kinkos.\\n-Then, they said to save paper they would send me an electronic bill... I've called them twice, and on the third time I finally got it.\\nHere's the point. If you're going to brand yourself as a premium hotel, take care of your customers. Don't nickel and dime people to use amenities like your gym (or pool - which WAS a draw to staying here). When customers request toothpaste or a 25 cent razor... don't nickel and dime them. Send it to their room with a smile.\\nI usually stay at the W - and their service is impeccable compared to this place. I was a bit worried from the reviews here, but from the moment I walked in, I knew it would be a fantastic stay! I arrived at 7:15 on a Saturday morning and my room was already ready, which was so wonderful. It was a gorgeous, spacious room that I was sad to leave (I actually cut some of my plans short so I could come back and hang around the room for a bit). \\nIt was really chilly in NYC and I called about turning the heat up before I left. When I got back, they'd left a space heater by my door, which was very much appreciated. The staff was very friendly and I would go back to this place in a heartbeat. Only regret is that I was only there for a night.\\nNot sure what people mean by outdated, etc. I had a huge flat screen, great toiletries and the room was well decorated. The towels were lush and soft, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the layout of the room was great for moving around and spreading out. The only disappointment was that wireless was $16.95 a day, but there's a Starbucks across the street.\\nCheck in here! Just spent a night there. Decent room, but not overwhelming. Biggest issue was rudness of the desk staff-low end service from them -- they appeared to be overwhelmed--especially if asked a question..if you need anything the door people are great. \\nHad a 1/2 day meeting and those facilities were very good. I rated service average as the people involved in the meeting were very good, the desk people were low end so the service averages out to average---make sense--hope so We had 2 days in New York at the end of my husband's business trip. The Le Parker was in an excellent position, near Central Park and 5th Avenue. \\nThe room itself was comfortable - very large, with a good sitting area.\\nThe shower was a bit strange - it was very long and the shower floor had a significant slope down to the shower. This was VERY slippery when wet, especially if there was any soap. Would not recommend if you are unsteady on your feet. The bed was OK. Air-conditioning was stifling - we set it on 19 Deg Cel - but felt like it was at 26 Deg Cel.\\nThe restaurant - Norma's was excellent - this is apparently an NY institution - I totally agree with this. The breakfast was amazing, large sizes, excellent service.\\nI would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be near Central Park. Stayed here for a night...then moved out if that's indicative of anything.\\nChecked in, no issues there. Bellman brought my luggage up to my room....cept he threw it. I was a bit confused. Anyways, I personally don't like the room style - big personal preference. I also found the outdated technology to be shocking. Category 6 Starwood property? Really? There was a 32in Sony Triniton TV in a rotating wall sitting there. Anyways, my room REEKED of smoke so I asked to be move. I guess SPG gold status got me moved to a suite (would have just been easier when I checked in?). Same bellman, I offered to carry my own luggage...\\nJust overall an underwhelming, slightly old and dilapidated hotel. Also, the almonds in the mini bar were $9. Just saying...\\nThe gym is GREAT except that you have pay $10 per visit - why not just include it in the price?\\nAnyhow, I hopped around hotels in NYC, probably won't be staying at the Meridien anytime soon unless everything else is sold out. From our checkin to checkout we truly enjoyed every service and the great responsiveness of the staff. Stayed here for one night and here are my observations on the plusses and minuses:\\nPlusses:\\n1) Great location\\n2) Terrific water pressure in shower\\n3) Comfortable bed\\nThe minuses:\\n1) Lots of street noise (I was on 12th floor). Having stayed in many other midtown hotels, this was by far the noisiest. Windows must be original construction\\n2) Flat screen TV's, but no HD! It's 2012 folks. Watching a standard def picture on a flat screen tv is ridiculous for an upscale midtown property\\n3) Others have observed that you cannot adjust the room temperature by yourself. You must call the front desk to have someone come up. Not very practical. I returned from an evening engagement at 11 o'clock to find the room chilly. Was I really supposed to call the front desk at that time and wait for someone to show up to make the room warmer?\\nI do hope that the hotel will consider improving on these points. I stayed in a jnr suite which has a little more space and is clean but not necessarily well equipped: there is no free wi fi in the room, the tv is large but the picture signal is not great, and the shower head temperature control was not fully functioning. The room decor is modern, but the combination of grey, brown, and orange together with low lighting isn't working for me - quite depressing to stay indoors. \\nWhat further bothers me is that guests get charged:\\ncharged $5 for using the pool per day and $10 for the gym\\nmore than $16 for a jar of cashew nuts from the mini bar (seriously, it wasn't a kilo in weight or anything)\\noh, and the pricey gimmicks such as if you want to use the 'dry bar', it will set you back $40 for someone to blow dry it for you. A msg saying 'don't do it' (i.e. yourself) is placed next to the hairdryer. \\nBest bits: The location is great for the park and good for tourists as v. centrally located, and the burger joint downstairs in the lobby is a contender for the best burger in NYC. Rooms are large, which is a real bonus in NYC. Staff on both the reception desk and concierge desk were very friendly, efficient and very professional. Food in Norma's and the Burger Bar were memorable. The hotel is in a great location; close to Central Park, Times Square, Broadway and shops around 5th Ave. Lots of good restaurants within walking distance. Stayed for several days with grandkids. Fantastic expeerience. Front desk upgraded us to a larger available room. Fantastic city and park views, 2 bathrooms, excellent in room dining service, and the pool on roof which got visited every day - great morning aquasize class; singing Bellman (really funny with grands). Excellent location. Staff very friendly and helpful. Got upgraded to a Junior Suite for free. Really great hotel. Will definitely stay again. Forget about special, or glam details of some trendy hotels.\\nWe visit NYC often and we regularly end up staying here. Why?\\n1. Location is great, for midtown. Perfect for morning runs in central park, especially when you are just in from Europe.\\n2. The fitness center and the pool are really good. I would say above most NY hotels.\\n3. The Burger Joint is very cool an we all end up there. Great idea in a big hotel.\\n4. ROoms are ok. Very standard and no style or frills but quite big. \\nSome of the staff can be a bit arrogant at Norma's which is recommendable breakfast experience (need advance booking). Everyone else is just ok.\\nBreakfast alternative is either Starbucks or Dean and De Luca (this one take it if you have time since it is so slow), both across the street on 56th. Le PM sports a great location but at prices upwards of $500/night this hotel disappoints. The room is particularly average and devoid of amenities available in every local Radisson . Everything cost extra including Internet access. Not even a coffee maker in the room and room service which the management strongly encourages is unaffordable at $8 for a cup of tea.\\nElevators did not work and the wait to get down from the thirtieth floor was upwards of ten minutes each morning. Mainly a business hotel ( our reason for staying) and one distraught business person complained that he was late to a meeting due to elevator problem. Save your $ for a broadway show and the Hampton Inn which is close and offers more and better amenities. I stayed at Parker Meridien for tow nights on a business trip this past week. I finally managed an upgrade after trying for four years on my annual trip to NYC for an event in April. The 1BR suite was a perfect size and really quite functional for someone who is working, going back and forth to an office during the day in midtown, changing clothes for meetings and evening events, etc. The bathroom was huge and I loved the design of the modern shower. I did not order room service or use the gym or pool on this trip. \\nI had breakfast both mornings in Norma's and found the eggs \"odd\", there is no other word, each time. They were fluffy in a fake way and seemed to have been coated in some sort of fake butter and still had no real flavor. The applewood bacon was heavily peppered for some reason and almost inedible. \\nAs mentioned, the larger room really enhanced my stay this time and made the end of my work days highly relaxing. The staff is good and responsive here and there are usually no surprises if you request something from them. My one complaint was the slowness of the elevators; particularly in the morning hours when people are on their way to work or meetings. They really need to upgrade them in some way. \\nParker is not my favorite hotel in NYC, but its convenience to my office in midtown and other attractions makes it a mainstay for my trips to the city. Stayed for several days with grandkids. Fantastic expeerience. Front desk upgraded us to a larger available room. Fantastic city and park views, 2 bathrooms, excellent in room dining service, and the pool on roof which got visited every day - great morning aquasize class; singing Bellman (really funny with grands). I have stayed at this hotel more than 15 times. The biggest plus is the very large and well equipped gym (which you have to pay for unless you are Platinum SPG). The beds are comfortable (just like all Westins) and are the biggest reason for staying here. The location is not bad, particularly if you want to be near Central Park. The breakfast is pretty good, particularly the granola\\nThe list of negatives cannot be ignored - and some are quite material:\\nThe room decorations are tired (and so can appear grubby), the fittings are pretty basic (other than the comfortable desk chair)\\nThe standard bathrooms are tiny (and the junior suites only have a shower)\\nThe cupboard is actually just a cheap curtain passing itself off as chic\\nYou cannot adjust the in-room thermostat...when I asked to get my room cooler, they sent someone up to my room who proceeded to open the window (on the 38th floor)!!\\nThe breakfast is very expensive, particularly when they tried to charge me $12 for a toasted bagel and butter\\nThe elevators are slow and the wait at peak periods can be frustrating This is a typical luxury New York hotel. Very expensive, but worth it. Good amenities, fairly clean rooms (I think it's a former apartment building.) Good service and if you need this location, it's very competitive with the neighboring properties.\\nThe hotel business in NYC is so crazy. It's like nothing else in the world. If you've stayed in New York a lot, you know what I mean. If you don't have much experience with NYC hotels, it's daunting and a wild experience.\\nSo this hotel is certainly a safe bet, but the price is probably way beyond most people's ability. If you're traveling on business and can fit it in your budget, you won't be disappointed. \\nBut if you're adventurous and have this kind of budget, you could do better unless you absolutely have to stay on this block. I didn't find the particular amenities to be all that interesting. The decor is dated and a bit worn. And there are so many endless choices that I think I would have chosen somewhere else. (But my reservation was made by my client, so I had no choice.) Read the reviews, heard the arguments, listened to the rebuttals. Here's the deal on this property:\\n-Excellent location in the city, blocks from the park, plenty of restaurants and food options nearby, and easy walk to Times Square (15 tiny blocks or so). \\n-The fitness center, while excellent compared to other hotels - something like 15,000 square feet, including very nice shower facilities, it's not the best fitness center anywhere in the city (I think someone claimed that). Anyway, tons of equipment, reasonable entrance charge, and the place was largely empty the two occasions I visited. Personal trainer on hand at all times, and complimentary fresh fruit. \\n-The rooms are nice. We had a standard on the 27th floor. It was spacious for a NY hotel. Two double beds were comfortable. TV was perfectly fine, and had a swivel on it. \\n-Staff were friendly throughout the visit, from check-in to check-out. \\n-Complimentary wifi in the lobby (you need the code)\\n-The property is showing a bit of wear and tear, but nothing dramatic. ie: a few chips on the walls, and such. The elevators were constantly slow. \\n-Some things to be bummed about. No coffee maker. Too bad too, because there is plenty of space for one. No refrigerator, but they do have a minibar. The HVAC unit is hands off! The thermostat cannot be adjusted. This was occasionally uncomfortable. On a warm afternoon though, we were able to crack open the window and get fresh air (and street noise) in. \\nOverall, if a fitness center is important to you, drop what you're doing and book this hotel. The rooms and location are also great, but balance this with price, as there are other hotels in the area. Loved the location. Close to subways and right behind Carnegie Hall. Le Parker Meridien is my hotel of choice when in NY. It has a fantastic location, great rooms and rates and many of the employees are there from trip to trip. Nice hotel. Stayed a few times in the past and was always superior...until recently. Room furnishings were tired and dated, and electronics were poor. Regular TV reception was very poor (no HD or I-pod player). Spent alot of money on an upgraded \"Park-view\" room, only to be staring at a construction crane. When I tried to move, there was nothing left..and no adjustment of our bill. Also spent alot of money on room service for diner and breakfast, which was mediocore at best. But the worst part was being charged a fee to use the hotel pool. I have used this pool many tmes without being charged, so when the front desk advised me of this charge I couldn't believe it. For the amount of money that this hotel charges for everything, to charge to use the pool is unconscionable. If you have a choice, stay somewhere else and save some money. Checked in last week and had read reviews that the staff was unfriendly. So untrue. Anandi Nellore helped us check in and then called the room to find out of all was ok. I said the view of Central was spectacular but that the room was quite small. She called back a short time later and said that she would move us to a suite the next day. The hotel to fully booked our first night. The suite was great. \\nAll of the staff were friendly, helpful and bent over backwards to be of assistance. I was handed an umbrella as I walked out of the hotel into pouring rain. I'm a frequent traveler and have stayed at several NYC hotels. Generally speaking what sets hotels apart in NYC are the quality &amp; friendliness of the staff, attention to small details and room quality. The rooms are in general smaller and a bit dingier than other cities. But at the top end of the hotels, one finds the waldorf, the W, St Regis etc which are a cut above the le meridien in terms of property quality. The service is so so and the other amenities are ok. The location is great however. But if you are looking to spend dollars in this range - look elsewhere Great property. Location is really great - close to 30 Rock and most of the big attractions. Rooms are designed to make the use of space and have a great setup. My only problem was that the hotel was a little strict about the raging party we threw at 3am on a Saturday. Which was all my fault but they could've handled it better! The hotel is well located, has good rooms with clean bathrooms and we enjoyed a wonderful central park view. Staff is efficient, but I would say rather on a distance than friendly.\\nAs it's not the cheapest hotel in the city, you'd expect to have at least one perk included, like a (small) breakfast, a drink downstairs, a day in the pool or the fitness, free wireless internet, ... but all of these services are fully priced. I know that's common for New York, but to pay for an hour of internet in your room is really not about the friendliness and customer service that is so passionately presented on their website. I brought my sister and family to New York for her first time and for her 60th birthday. We stayed 5 nights, received great room upgrades, and the front desk staff and the concierge were wonderful. On our last night, we got back to the hotel in a pouring rain and wanted a farewell night cap. The bar was closed because its ceiling had just collapsed so the front desk suggested a beer in the very downscale on-site hamburger joint. The staff there was very disorganized and rude. We tried to stand in line at the order window to get some beer and were told to sit down and wait for table service. We no one came to the table, we tried to get the attention of a waiter and were told we had to go back in stand in line at the order window. We ended up never getting served, and got no satisfaction when complaining to Food and Beverage Manager Aiske who was also unpleasant and ineffectual. The only choice left to us was a mini-bar drink in the room which was hardly a fitting birthday party. On top of that, only 2 of the 3 elevators serving the hotel's upper floors are in working condition, leaving us with 10 to 20 minute waits every time we wanted to go up or down. Upon checkout, the front desk person asked about my stay and said that considering our experience at the hamburger place the night before, he'd try to waive a $10 workout fee. He checked with the Front Desk Manager who denied the request. No attempt for remedy and quite unusually weak management for the Le Meridien standard!!l Fantastic location and overall nice hotel.\\nSome staff rude but I've been told that's just the way New Yorkers are.\\n Norma's food was amazing and the Burger Joint was spectacular....best burger ive ever had! I will preface this review by saying that I'm a frequent traveler to NYC, a platinum member of Starwood, and not a very big fan of NYC.\\nI arrived at the hotel right off a redeye flight. The check in was very efficient and courteous. The door men were helpful when asked. The front desk said that a room was ready so checked me in to a 10th floor room right next to the elevator facing north. As soon as I walked in, all I could hear was the construction site immediately to the north of the hotel (the hotel is between 56th and 57th street, but doesn't span the entire block). Immediately adjacent to the hotel is a construction site that looks like it's going to be going on for at least 9 months if not longer, and it's very loud.\\nI went and asked for a different room. There was none available so I left my name and number, put my luggage with the bell desk and went and got a massage. To their credit, they called me as soon as another room was available. They put me on a high floor with a beautiful view of Central Park.\\nI was at least 35 floors up, but will say that the noise was awful. More so than even other hotels in NYC (and I've stayed at several hotels in Times Square). I figured out that the noise during the day was from 1) the construction site and 2) 57th street. I constantly heard honking and sirens since 57th is a major east west street. The lack of double paned windows also doesn't help.\\nAdditionally, the high floors are serviced by 3 elevators. On two of my 5 night stays, I had to wait a good 8-10 minutes for an elevator. I (as well as all the guests waiting for me) found this to be unacceptable.\\nBut beyond the noise and the elevators, the views are great from the high floors, service very efficient, beds are comfortable, rooms are old but functional. The location is great as it's walking distance to almost anything you'd want to do in midtown (MoMA, Central Park, 5th Avenue, Times Square) and there is almost every bus or train that you'd need to take within a 7 minute walk.\\nI will definitely stay again if I'm going for business (meaning out of the hotel from 9-8 pm daily) but will find somewhere else to stay if on vacation. I like the style of the room. It's not super fancy but simple and neat. My room was also quite spacious for one person. The bad thing about the room is that it was a bit old. You could see scratches on the bathtub and the safety. The TV also looked very old and worked slowly, I had to wait for the TV to respond after pressing the button on the remote control. The A/C didn't work well, too. I gave up and turned it off. There was no coffee maker in the room, so I had to order a 16 dollar room service coffee the first morning. \\nThe location of the hotel is excellent, close to the central park and the subway stations. Stayed one night on a theater trip with family. Arrived at noon not expecting our rooms to be ready, but we were able to check in, anxious to get out on a beautiful Sat. afternoon and explore (our rooms were ready at 3 PM, a promised). We able to leave our bags with the bellman, which was great. My daughter needed to change, and we were directed to the fitness area one flight below the lobby. The three overly-made-up women in black tee's who were attending this massively busy area (one person using equipment) seemed flummoxed by this request. I don't know if the hotel operates the fitness center, but perhaps the lovely, friendly and professional front desk personnel could give these employees a few lessons in courtesy. Other than that our room on the 17th floor was quiet and comfortable, the bathroom adequate for our needs and very clean. No views, but we weren't in the room that long to require one. Enjoyed Central Park and some of the local sights. I would stay again. The hotel was a perfect location for a family trip to NYC with kids. Close to theater, the playgrounds in the park, and an indoor pool for a break from the city for the kids. The only big problem was the heat/AC. You cannot adjust it at all. The hotel can turn it \"on\" or \"off\" but that's it. The first night was a hot, sweatly one because we couldn't stop the heat from blowing. Not much sleep that night. The elevators were very, very slow, and the TVs in the elevators weren't working right, but the staff was nice, and the room (we had a suite) worked well for a family of 4. Bell staff was especially friendly. I recently returned from a 3 week business trip, and after concluding a business stay at the Hilton Garden Inn/Chelsea I wanted to stay in a nicer, more plush hotel for my weekend respite. I chose the Le Parker Meridien because I am a Starwood Platinum guest and because I'm not a big fan of the St. Regis in New York City. I also got a fantastic rate of $239 per night for a deluxe king room.\\nThe hotel is quite nice, and I would gladly stay there again. However, despite assurances there was effective air conditioning when booking and again on check-in, I was upgraded to a junior suite only to discover after several calls and a maintenance visit that the A/C hadn't even been turned on in the hotel yet! I was quite annoyed, and expressed significant displeasure to various managers. Eventually, I informed them they needed to find me a comparable room at another Starwood hotel with working A/C and at no additional cost--since the error was completely theirs in falsely advertising a/c for the property. (I require very cool temps in order to be comfortable and to fall asleep.)\\nAfter they did check and discover there were only 2 other Starwood properties with vacancies (it was Easter weekend), but that both similarly had not turned on their A/C, they offered to upgrade me to a suite for my trouble. I still informed them I would prefer a cooler room more than a suite, but since no other option seemed available, I took them up on their offer. A very nice manager took me to visit several suites, and I chose a smaller suite which faced Central Park with amazing views and didn't have morning sun to wake me/warm the room in the morning when I was more likely to be in the room. The manager also had 3 fans brought to my room, and called in to check on me after I was settled and again the next morning. All in all, considering the fact they could do nothing more, I was impressed with the hotel's attempts to salvage a bad situation. \\nMy upgraded suite was a wonderful room on the 31st floor, with a very spacious living room and a decent sized bedroom area separated by a revolving TV cabinet (which allowed TV viewing from either room/area). The bath was nice sized, as well. My view was wonderful, looking across Central Park.\\nI had great room service breakfasts, both of which were comp'd by the hotel due to the A/C issues, as well, and they also gave me some extra Starpoints for my trouble. The room service is expensive, of course, but this is New York--though I was spared that on my bill, fortunately. \\nAll in all, I would GLADLY stay again at this hotel--though I would need to ensure that they had turned on the A/C by the time of my visit for the change in season. If you do not require A/C to my degree, then I would highly recommend this hotel if you can get a rate as good as I had found. Service was obviously outstanding. They couldn't have done more to try to remedy the situation...and everyone was VERY obliging and friendly in trying to solve the problem. Obviously, I should never have been informed that the hotel HAD A/C when it didn't, but that wasn't the in-house staff's fault (except for the check-in agent who erred in telling me so). My son, Joey and I celebrated our birthdays at Le Parker Meridian NYC. We've been a few times before and always loved it, but this time was extra special- from birthday balloons to friendly staff to a quickly place burger order to a room with a view AND WHAT A VIEW!\\nThank you NYC and Le Parker Meridian. We'll be back. Nice hotel, very well located. Room was okay (bathroom a bit too small), with a wonderful view on Central Park; air conditioning needs to be improved. Room servce staff could be more kind and efficient when setting up a rollaway bed. Excellent bar and breakfast. Strange choices such as the barber shop in front of the elevators. We could not try the burger joint but the contrast with a 5 star hotel was astounding; probably overestimated. We've stayed several times at this hotel, and always had great service and a very good experience. The location is superior and rooms have been very clean. Front desk service is very efficient. Only downside as I see it is that they no longer provide a hot water kettle and coffee/tea service. With 2 entrances, it's easy to get going in the right direction. A wonderful bar is on the way to the 57th street exit, and there's a Starbucks right across the street (and a small Dean and Deluca outpost a few doors away) from the 56th street exit. A big thank you to the many on your staff who made our stay so comfortable. I booked over 20 rooms for a group of artists who were appearing at a show in Brooklyn. Everyone went out of the way to accommodate our needs, both individually and as a group. \\nWe would like to mention Reina and Yvonne who helped with all aspects of the rooms. Francesca, Nigel, and Robb at Knave who helped us solve an early morning catering problem and Lisa who helped with our evening event at the hotel. Everyone in the group had a most positive experience &amp; was enthusiastic about all aspects of LPM. We look forward to our next stay with you. Everything was perfect. Had a clear view of Central Park on a prime floor! We stayed at Le Parker Meridien last year and I am finally getting around to reviewing it..\\nThe location of the hotel is great. A few blocks north of Times Square which is nice because it is central and because it is away from the busy area around the square.\\nThe staff was great and upgraded us for our Anniversary. The rooms were very well decorated and clean. I would highly reccomend! Great experience, the room was spacious, and he hotel staff was exceptional. Probably the best hotel I have stayed in new York. The breakfast was a must. Le Parker Meridien is a very nice hotel. The best thing about the hotel is the view, if you book a Tower view room. These rooms have amazing views of Central Park. The other great thing about this hotel is the location. It is only three blocks south of Central Park and in the middle of all the great shopping and not far from Times Square. There is also a Starbucks right across the street for you coffee addicts. The hotel has a fairly typical New York City style room. It is well appointed and fairly large. You won't find many hotels in New York with huge rooms, unless you want to pay a lot of money but Le Parker Merdien has larger rooms than the Hilton or Marriott and it is a much better hotel overall. I loved that the restaurant Norma's only serves breakfast and they serve it until 3pm. Very few hotels do this. I usually have to be down before 11am or I have to eat somewhere else. The breakfast was rated the best in NYC by Zagat and it is delicious. 7 other NYC restaurants also got this title in 2012. The portions are huge. Be prepared. My cheese omelette was the size of a toaster and they gave me ten pieces of bacon as my side. They also have a restaurant called the Burger Joint. Zagat also rated this and said it was the best burger in New York City. I didn't have it since the line was too long and we were doing other things but it looks delicious. They are one of the few hotels with a beautiful indoor pool on the roof. It is on the 42nd floor and, if you like to swim or your kids want to play, this is a great hotel for them. They just opened a new spa downstairs where women can get blowouts only and men can get shaves and haircuts. The hotel is also animal friendly. I brought my dog, Lola and she was treated very well and welcomed at the property. The bathrooms are fairly small, so if you want a huge bathroom, this is not your place. It is quiet. You don't hear your neighbors when you're in the room. Our room had a huge, brand new plasma TV. When I was there, they told me they will soon be renovating all the rooms, so there could be some changes when you get there. The hotel is a big hotel, so give yourself about ten minutes to get down to the lobby via the elevator. On one trip it stopped at 15 floors and we were in there for about 10 minutes. It wasn't anything terrible and only happened once because it was a holiday weekend. If you want to be in a great location at a very nice hotel that doesn't break the bank but is much more classy than a Hilton or Marriott, stay here. Excellent chioce for New York... Slightly pricey, but close to Time Square and all the action in NYC.... close to subway, as well as 5 minute walk to tour bus routes.... An excellent choice when staying in NYC... Rooms were clean, with good beds, and a large bathroom and shower made it s truly joyous stay. \\nStaff were very friendly, and it helped to have a Starbucks directly across from the hotel :) , especially in the cold winters that NYC experiences\\nWould definitely go back Look, when I rate this as good, I'm rating it as good by the standards of relatively upscale hotels in New York City. I would choose to stay here over most other hotels, but it also has some drawbacks that you should be aware of, and which mean that given the choice of the W or other similar upscale hotel, I would go there. We got a junior suite upgrade, which was appreciated, but felt somewhat off-put when they offered us a nicer suite if we would pay for an upgrade. We had two SPG Ambassador Platinum members in a room, which, should have qualified for best available room, so we kind of felt like they were fudging the SPG rules. In our room, there were a couple of glaring issues which the hotel failed to remedy. First, the bathroom sink barely drained, which the cleaning staff had to be aware of, but which was not fixed. Second, the Air Conditioning was not sufficient to actually cool the room - there was cold air coming out of both units but not in sufficient volume to make any difference, which was annoying, and adversely impacted my quality of sleep. Last, the bathrobe hanging in the bathroom had a big stain on it when we got there. I would really think that the cleaning staff would have noticed this and changed it out, but they never did. We left glasses from the bar in our room one night and the cleaning staff placed them outside our door the next morning, but they sat there for almost 24 hours before being collected even as other room service ware nearby was collected. The robe and glassware led me to conclude that the attention to detail that one might expect from such a hotel was somewhat lacking. One other thing to be aware of, especially for business travelers, is that this hotel has far too few elevators for the number of guests and during busy times the wait for the elevator is long (5+ min), elevator rides stop at every floor, and the elevators become uncomfortably packed full of people. \\nThe lobby bar is really nice if a bit short on seating, and the restaurant has great breakfast, but make reservations in advance. The hotel has a private gym in the basement that SPG platinum gets free use of, and this is quite possibly one of the best hotel gyms I've ever used. It is a two story gym with lots of cardio equipment and a lot of machines and free weights with ample floor space. All in all, I'd happily stay there again, but didn't have such a great experience that I will go out of my way to do so, which many Meridien hotels have provided me. Drop dead view from 33rd floor over central park. Rooms are a little threadbare, but that view makes up for a lot. Food is great but a little expensive. Cafe pulls a good espresso. Stayed four four days. Had problems with the room being too warm, no AC!!! Very noisy, with construction and garbage collection going on because we had to leave the windows open (3 inches, big whoop!) No atmosphere in lobby area, very cold. Would not stay there again!!!! This is a nice hotel. Bed was comfortable. Room service was prompt. There's a barber shop on the lobby floore, and that's helpful if you're there on business. The hotel is within walking distance to Columbus Circle, Times Square, Central Park, 5th Avenue. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. We requested a room with a view of Central Park and they were able to accommodate us. The only issue I had was the street noise, and we were on the 31st floor. I think they could invest in some better windows. I might not have noticed the noise so much, but we'd just come from a hotel in Barcelona where there was zero street noise even on the 6th floor. Great staff. Well accomodating. Hotel is missing a few key items to make it great. We stayed here with our children (5 and 1) last weekend and it was great. We were upgraded to a larger room on a higher floor and the crib we requested was waiting in the room for us. The location was perfect as it was close to all of the things we wanted to do in NYC as a family. We heard that the hotel had the best burgers in town (there was a line up for the restaurant every time we passed the lobby) and were delighted to find out that we could place the order from our room and easily pick it up without lining up (which we did). We had a smooth check in and check out. The staff was friendly. I don't have anything negative to say about our stay or the hotel .. just wish we got to stay longer! I wasn't aware that there were any kids activities other than the little booklet and crayons they give when you check in which is why I gave it an average rating. We travel to NYC once or twice a year to visit our daughter, and always stay at the Parker Meridien. The location is perfect, especially for runners like us who love Central Park. The staff are extremely helpful, the rooms are clean and comfortable. The ONLY thing I would say is that if the bathrooms were just a bit bigger, it would be a lot easier to share with my husband! :) We were super excited about the renovation to the fitness center and the addition of the Dry Bar (for blow outs). The burgers at the Burger Joint really are the best ever, and Norma's has an amazing brunch (albeit expensive). I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I always enjoy myself staying there. Many sweet small things accumulates and make a big difference. The staff are firendly and remember my preferences as a regular customer, well abort of. We were worried about bed bugs and cleanliness after reading so many bad reviews re NYC hotels. This was not the case with Parker Meridien. The level of cleanliness is outstanding and the housekeeping staff made sure to work around our needs, even if we decided to sleep in late. The concierge staff was always friendly and patient, trying to help us with whatever we needed and offering advice when asked. We felt as if we the hotel home. This is one hotel to which we will be returning. EVERYTHING was top notch from the check in women, Gold Upgrade to a FANTASTIC room by NYC standards, Norma's (pricey but perfect!), and even the barbershop.\\nDid not have a single complaint which is rare for me. Check in was fine. They were suppose to call us when our room was ready and never did. We went up and found the room very very small. It was extremely warm in the room (72) so we put the air on and left for 5 hours. we came back and it was the same..called maintenance. She changed the filter and opened the windows. She also told us that the hotel sets the air at 65 and it won't go any lower...so why is there a thermostat and AC. We had to keep the windows opened a crack the 3 days we were there. We then went down to breakfast the next day at Norma's in the lobby. Highly expensive to say the least, not your normal breakfast to say the least. Could not get just eggs or french toast or pancakes, everything was gourmet and was made drowning in sugar, chocolate, fruit or all together. We got a phone call and had to leave, our server charged us $12 for a glass of OJ and $7 for a cup of coffee and you can't fight city hall. I was disgusted from then on and did not drop a cent in that hotel. If you want an awesome breakfast good old fashion type with huge servings go to Ellens Stardust diner on 52nd and Broadway. It is an easy 4 block walk from the Parker. The servers take turns singing since they are waiting to get on Broadway and the food is 5 STAR and the prices are $8 - 9 for a huge breakfast.\\nBeds are rather uncomfortable and the pillows were awful...i find Courtyard's way above this hotel. I don't know how people are saying comfy platform beds and updated rooms because that is not what we got! The view from the \"park view\" room was really fantastic. We also loved the contemporary stile decoration of the hotel; there was nothing dated, there was nothing old or even consumed. Staff was kind and polite, specially at the check-in. The mnaintenance of the cleanliness of the room was perfect, the bed clothes was always very clean and smelling so well... The location speaks for itself. Having the Burger Joint\" just downstairs was a real bonus. The only reason I didn't rate \"excellent\" is that the heater of the room was not working. Since it was not so cold we just slept under the duvet and did not even communicate the problem to the staff. We will surely stay there again and recommend it to all. Our long weekend at the Meridien was perfect. The staff was very helpful, finding us an accessible room at check-in (not easy to do at 3 in the morning!). The location couldn't be better... an easy walk to Central Park. A bit longer walk to the Theatre district. We found very good restaurants in the immediate neighborhood. The Burger Joint was fun at 11pm, and the burger was good, but I'd pick a time that you don't have to wait in line for your burger. The room was perfect for us, a very comfortable stay. The TV on a pole was the only thing that was quirky about the room. View of the park,close to the subway that takes you to Chelsea, meatpacking district &amp; cool shopping. Easy walk to MOMA, inexpensive taxis rides to great, safe neighbourhoods.Loved our comy platform bed and updated nyc style room. Will use the pool next visit. What a view! The Meridien is our hotel of choice in NYC. The combination of location, amenities, food and workout/spa is decisive. Service is smooth and discreet, as well. Parker is great. \\nSuper location by the subway and the park. Front desk is cheerful but chill. Heard the gym was baller but ran in the park instead. Toiletries are nice.\\nOnly bad thing: Tv's in rooms are from 1995 A great place to stay, and centrally located. We took our teens, 13 and 16. They especially loved the Burger joint. We had 2 Jr. suites, and they were spacious and comfortable. Our teens, a boy and a girl had a pull out Queen and a King bed, and we let them have the suite with the larger bathroom. We did not have time to use the roof top pool, but what a great feature and great view! We booked our room with Priceline and got a great rate. The room was large, well furnished and quiet. The lobby was clean and the service was excellent. The hotel is close to shopping, museums and Central Park. It was a short walk to Penn Station and Times Square. Very upscale with a modern flare. No coffee maker in the room, but did have a flat screen TV and water glasses and the bed was comfortable. I can't comment on the stay before summarizing perhaps the most chaotic and irritating reservation experience I've ever had. My daughter was performing with a choir at Carnegie Hall and the hotel was convenient. I reserved a room for her and my wife in my wife's name for Wednesday night checking out Sunday. I was going to join them on Friday and reserved a second room in my own (different last) name, all with sub-$300 AAA rates- decent for the neighborhood. \\nThat was all fine, until they decided to arrive on Thursday instead. When I tried to change the date on the web site, the price jumped to $800. I decided that was insane and that human beings wouldn't stand for it, so I called the reservation line, where, after several minutes repeating that I did not want to move the whole reservation back a day but shorten it by a day, the agent said she couldn't fix it, put me on hold for about 5 minutes, then came back and told me that the hotel manager had made the change and kept the same rate, and also that she had requested connecting rooms as I'd asked. I thanked her and forgot about it for a while, but for some reason became concerned a few days later. I called the reservation line again and was told the reservation had not been changed and again got put on hold for 5 minutes and again was told it would be taken care of.\\nI figured things were fine until I got a pre-arrival e-mail still showing the original arrival date and I hit the roof. I called the hotel this time and they said there was a notation in the reservation saying the date should be changed but that nobody had actually made the change. They said not to worry and changed the date.\\nThe next, day, my wife arrived, her reservation was fine, but no accommodation had been made for connecting rooms and that the clerk was insisting that nothing could be done about it. She called me from the front desk and I had to get on the phone with the clerk and have her get the manager. Apparently, the notation for connecting rooms had neglected to mention who to connect to. The manager understood that it was unlikely that I had asked for a room connecting to some unknown party and that it was clearly their mistake, and though it was impossible to connect at that point that we could be next door and could check out at 4PM with no charge. \\nOnce we got there the hotel was fine. New York hotels are allowed a certain quirkiness that would not be tolerated in less concentrated environments, and ours is no exception. With the advent of flat screens, the hotel took advantage of the opportunity to wall mount the TVs and eliminate the bulky furniture underneath. This leaves the rooms feeling almost expansive, with generous space between the end of the bed and the opposite wall. It also leaves the room without any place to store one's clothes, if one is inclined to unpack. My room had one small drawer to the right of the desk and a shelf to the left. That's it. But you do get the expansive feel and a wall that really looks like there should be a piece of furniture there, especially because there are no less than 3 sets of electrical outlets that were probably useful when TV was sitting on the dresser.\\nThe beds were fine, there's an odd paucity of glasses and no fluffy robes, and the faucets in the bathroom are set about 1/4 too far back, so if you have the water on low pressure it lands on the counter instead of in the sink. Overall, though, I found it a pleasant, convenient place to stay. It's close to multiple subway lines and has 3 Starbucks, a Dean and Deluca cafe and a well-stocked fancy grocery store all within a block or so. I would certainly stay there again. This is the fourth time that I have stayed here on business and it is a most fabulous hotel. I have been upgraded twice to a junior suite, which was spacious and cool. It is always pristine and the staff who service the rooms are very friendly and accommodating. \\nThe breakfast/ brunch has one of the best menus that I have seen. I have eaten the Eggs Benedict with porcini mushroom sauce and the rock lobster and grilled asparagus omelet. Both were amazing, but be aware that potion size is BIG. Unfortunately only 30% of bookings are reserved for hotel guests, which did not impress. However, after some strong words, I got a reservation at a convenient time. Waiting time on a weekend is generally 45-60 minutes, so it is worth booking ahead. \\nThe hidden burger joint by the reception does amazing burgers. Look for the neon burger sign or the queue of people waiting to get inside. \\nThe bar is perfect for an evening drink before hitting the town, star spotting is not uncommon. I have seen Matt Dillion casually stroll through. impersonal and over priced, not a 4 star hotel, more like a 3 star. $17.00 for internet access, no robes, no water glasses, no flat screen TV. Bedding? you'll find better at a 2 star hotel. The rooftop pool is pretty cool though, that lessened the pain of my one night there. Moved to another hotel for the rest of our NYC visit. Rooms are small and dated. Hotel charges extra for EVERYTHING (toothbrush, gym, pool). Thermostats in the rooms don't work and you have to call front desk to send up an engineer to adjust the temperature. View of central park for the room I had was very nice. The hotel was absolutely beautiful from the lobby, to the hallways, to the rooms. We had a gorgeous view on NYC from our room. It is a perfect location...only 2 blocks from Central Park and close to many great restaurants and bars. The staff was so nice and helpful, especially the concierge Emily Achilles. I travel a lot and there are a few things that are really important to me when on the road: sleep, location, and food. At Le Parker Meridien the beds and pillows are great and I always get a good night's sleep there (have stayed here 3-4 times). The hotel location is fantastic, just a few blocks from the park, theatres, Times Square (but not too close, which is nice). The staff is fabulous, Norma's restaurant &amp; room service menu is one of the best in the country (another great one that comes to mind is the Kimpton in Seattle), and Parker Meridien room service workers are always willing to make whatever changes you want to the menu items. They also willingly suggest components to go with your desired menu changes. Many hotels do not like to stray from the menu more than a little. \\nSo this place sort of makes my travel life better. And that's pretty valuable. Hotel was in a fantastic location; a short walk to Central Park, Times Square and Rockefeller Center. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was very pleased with the cleanliness of the room and the room size. Emilie Achilles helped check me in and she was fabulous! I would absolutely return to this hotel when visiting the city next! Firstly, let me begin by saying I have Platinum status with Starwood so I have stayed at quite a few different hotels in New York.\\nWhen I reserved I booked a room with a King however when I arrived they could only provide a room with two doubles. They would not upgrade me to another room that had a King, nor compensate me in anyway for the inconvenience. \\nThe room they gave me had soaking wet carpet next to the window. Since the room is small I had to be careful where I placed my things. This is one of the more expensive hotels in the area, and this ranks in as the worst hotel experience I've ever had. \\nThere are plenty of hotels in NYC, skip this one. Apart from a very good business hotel. This hotel also serves special and best Breakfast in New York City that you can't find it in other hotels. But you may have to wait in line as this restaurant is too popular. The location is Great and it is only 2 blocks away from the 5th Avenue and Apple Store. The Gym is very well equipped too and the staffs in Gym are very helpful ! I ventured into Manhattan to see my cousin's daughter perform at Carnegie Hall. Le Parker Meridien is right down the block and a very convenient place to stay. For the most part I enjoyed my four night stay. I stayed in a Junior Suite and it was nice. The bed was firm but it could have used a nice thick mattress pad. The pillows were flat and uncomfortable. The windows opened, which was nice in the evenings. However, garbage trucks collected trash across the street until about midnight. After that, the nice cool evening air felt really nice. I'm sure rooms on much higher floors would not have experienced the noise factor. That said, my family and I didn't spend too much time in the room on the trip so I'd say it was a minor inconvenience. The only other issue we experienced with the hotel was that there were some dirty/used glasses left on the floor in the hall just outside the room across from ours for THREE DAYS, even though housekeeping promptly cleaned our room each afternoon. They were promptly removed by someone after we informed the front desk.\\nThe rooftop pool was very nice. It was clean, warm (good for a few cool nights) and a decent size. The views of Central Park and the surrounding city were spectacular. You should be aware that pool access costs an additional $15 per room for each day that you choose to use it.\\nRafael at the Concierge desk was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful in arranging a dinner reservation for me for the evening on which my family and I arrived. As I had never been in New York before, I asked him to recommend an italian or seafood restaurant that serves really good food and withing walking distance of the hotel. He even made the reservation for me. His recommendation was enjoyed tremendously. We won't stay anywhere else when we venture into the city. Both children love the hotel (also our dog Bella loves the hotel) Spotless, great service, the Burger Joint, great location. We were surprised by the $15 pool use fee per day. A new fee that has been implemented. We didn't see it on the website nor did the front desk tell us about it. The use of the pool should be complimentary. Love love love Le Parker Meridien on 56th in NYC. Great service, lovely new rooms, European feel, great location - all wonderful. Can't wait to go back. I had a terrific stay at the Parker Meridien. This was my second stay. I had booked a room with a king sized bed, but at the time of my check-in, there were no rooms with king sized beds available. As a result, they upgraded me to a junior suite. Although I've noticed that some of the reviews reference older tv, carpeting and lamp fixtures--the room that I stayed in was newly renovated. There was a flat screen tv, modern light fixtures and a really nice bathroom.\\nOn my first stay during the winter, there was a fair amount of construction noise from a near-by hotel, but this construction has been completed, and all is once again quiet. \\nThe location of the hotel is excellent for business travelers who are visiting midtown Manhattan. It's also a great place for tourists who may be visiting New York, particularly if you're interested in taking advantage of being so near Central Park. (It's very easy to go for an early morning run in the park). The hotel is also centrally located near several different subway lines, which should make getting around New York City significantly easier. Also, the hotel is near many different restaurants and more informal eateries, so those there are many options at different price points. I was first introduced to this hotel when I made an appearance on the \"CBS Early Show\" several years ago. CBS made the initial decision to put me up there but I have eagerly made it my hotel of choice ever since! Great location, spotless rooms and amenities, and wonderfully comfortable king size beds! The Burger Joint downstairs is great! A flower waited at the door, a great view on Central Park waited inside the room. Great service and smiles all over. I got my room on Priceline for $128 plus taxes. I wanted two beds so I emailed guest relations and they were able to confirm two-beds with no issues. At check-in I asked for a view of Central Park and again, no issues. The room was large, the beds were over-sized twin beds, but very clean and comfortable. The bath amenities are Peter Thomas Roth, and the towels are chunky and fluffy. The service from multiple staff, from front desk to bell desk was lovely. You can enter/exit the hotel from 56th or 55th. If anything can be improved it's the old TV, carpeting and some lamp fixtures, which were rusty and had seen better days. This hotel is in a great location a couple of blocks away from Central Park South. The room was spotless and looked recently updated, as did the whole floor we were on as well as the lobby. I was happily surprised to see Peter Thomas Roth products in the bathroom. First time I ever saw that anywhere. Bed was very comfortable and the sheets were so soft. The only complaint I had was that even though there were a few different options for which kind of pillow to use, none of them were comfortable. Lovely hotel with very comfortable rooms with great bar and restaurants on site and a superb pool. The staff were excellent and very attentive but be warned you have to pay to use the gym which is the only negative point about the hotel We still love this hotel and were happy to hear that they are taking the hint to renovate their dated televisions and rooms. They are up to floor 9 as of 3/10/2012 and are working their way up. They also completes some renovations to the pool area- new flooring and new floor to ceiling windows. However, it will cost you! As of February, they now charge $15 EACH DAY you use the pool per room. I found this to be a tough pill to swallow as we stay here regularly and it had been free to all guests prior to these renovations. They have been also adding other vendors such as a nail salon and \"dry bar\" for hairstyling in the basement- where I, admittedly, have never been. Beware of the prices listed on the mini bar too- I was charge $9.25 for a Heinekin that was on the menu for $8.50. Overdue renovations should not be reason to make your guests feel ripped off. Great location; walking distance to all the hot spots. The Parker team is incredible - down to earth, fun, knowledable &amp; polite. Hotel was spotless - the take personal responsibility for keeping the hotel looking good. Inclusive - the pool is in the penthouse of the hotel on the 41st floor offering an amazing view of the city; it's great that they made the penthouse common space so all guests can enjoy the view (wish we didn't have to pay $10/15 to use the hotel though). The rooms are spacicous - lots of living space. I lived in the NYC area for 12 years so I know the city well. This was one of my first trips back and one of my first opportunities to stay in a NYC hotel. What a great experience it was. The staff at Le Parker Meridien is amazing. From the kind folks at the front desk to the concierge staff to the luggage guys, all were great! I would definitely stay here again on another trip to the city. Highly recommended!! We stayed at the Parker Meridien for two nights and had a wonderful time right in the center of NYC. The staff was always very friendly and helpful - especially when we requested a room as far away from th elevators as possoble. We had a great view on Central Park and we will definitely return on our next trip to the Big Apple. We love the Parker-Meridien! Great location, room, service, food and even (for NYC) the rates! We eagerly look forward to our next visit. I have always had pretty good service here and stay here at least once a year when I need to be near the theatres or Central Park. I have never had a problem with my Starwood Gold benefits. The burger joint in the hotel is a popular destination; there are also other good spots within a few blocks. I like the habitual efficiency of LPM, its location and good food. When possible, I make it a point to stay here. There are a lot of fine hotels in Manhattan but what sets this hotel apart is the service. I was traveling with my wife, six month old son and our nanny. The connecting rooms were ready upon checkin, the room service was quick, and the PM desk shift was EXTREMELY generous with a late checkout. So generous - in fact - that I won't post the time. I have stayed at a lot of other large hotels in NY and Las Vegas - were you feel like a number - The staff here went above and beyond to ensure that you felt like a valued guest. Thanks! Rating:\\nIt's in a great central location for both arts, entertainment and shopping. The rooms are quite small, but this is NYC after all, so that's the norm... The decor is quite dark and mainly brown, a tad boring. The bed is nothing to get excited about. They also charge for Internet (although it's very fast!). And not only that, it's also per device and not just by room.... So it's a 3 for me. \\nTheir saving grace is their wonderful staff!\\nLocation:\\nCan't really ask for better! So close to everything exciting theatre, arts, concerts, shopping.....\\nRoom:\\nHad a junior suite facing the city. The room is substantially larger than a regular king room.\\nThere are two ways to go about the rooms. You can either have a smaller room, but with a central park view. Or a larger room facing the other direction.\\nThe bed was firm and boring. It also had no bathtub, but a large walk-in shower. Even if you do go for a room with a bathtub, please be aware that they are very small....\\nNice Peter Thomas Roth amenities. It could be reasonably darkened out at night and we couldn't hear too much traffic.\\nIt's also very clean\\nStaff:\\nThey're lovely and very helpful. I can't say enough great things about the concierge team!!\\nFood: \\nBreakfast is nothing special, but acceptable. They do have a fantastic hamburger place right next o the lobby though. \\nInternet:\\nGgrrrr this is one of my travel pet peeves.... Why in this day and age do hotels still charge for Internet??? And especially when it's not just per room, but per device!!! We all (almost anyways) travel with a laptop, iPad and smart phone and need to be able to hook up all of our toys without getting fleeced!\\nIt was however veeeeery fast, which is always nice!\\nA/C:\\nThis was a tad annoying. The room was really too warm, but there was no way to cool it as they don't turn on their AC system until later on in the year.... I truly enjoyed my stay here. My wife and I came in the middle of february with our 6 year old daughter who had never been to NY before. I was impressed the second I got out of the car. the doormen were incredibly nice helped us find a cheaper place to park than the hotel parking lot. The people at the front desk were very acomodating sasha in particular gave us an upgrade to a junior suite after there was a problem with our daughter not being on the reservation. the room was nice and spacious for NYC. \\nWe ate at the Burger joint our first night and really enjoyed it the burgers are great and the attitude of the place was really cool and hip, hidden away in the corner. \\nNorma's was our breakfast destination of choice and everyone is right about what they say great food the only downside being that on sunday there was a long wait so we decided to go somewhere else\\nThe pool has its ups and downs. While the pool itself is astounding from the views, to the pool itself. the fact that there is a charge is truly cheap and annoying. I was paying a lot of money to stay in the hotel and yet the hotel deemed it necessary to charge 15$ to use the pool for the day, ridiculous. Even with the charge we used the pool every day and the staff there was as incredible as everywhere else. The lifeguards are all great, I forgot his names but the redhead lifeguard was great remembering us every time and lending my daughter goggles, noodles, and a bunch of pool toys. \\nthe basement was somewhat under construction which was a little annoying because it took away from my using of the gym but the staff was incredibly accomadating and the on staff trainer, greg, was helpful and helped me out with the machines. the equipment there is all top notch and there are cool little computers that track your workout.\\nThe concierge was really good helped us out with shows and restaurants.\\nIf I was rating this hotel just on the amenities the ranking would probably be a bit lower but the staff from the front desk to the pool was some of the best i have encountered. I will definitely be coming back Location is close to many things and to subway stops. Just a few blocks to Central Park. Construction is going on nearby. Beginning at midnight on a Friday night in February there was heavy work going on. The front desk said they weren't aware it was going to happen that night and offered to move me if it was continuing the next night. They said they would call me to let me know the status of the construction, but they never did and would not answer calls to the front desk. Luckily there was no more construction during the weekend. We stayed in a junior suite with our 14 year old and 4 year old. It was on the smaller side compared to other suites I have stayed in, and more expensive. Pros - the staff was very friendly and accommodating to our requests, very clean room, room service was great, breakfast at Norma's was fantastic, and location is very close to Central Park. We were also given a later checkout at no additional charge. Cons - an additional $15 charge per room per night to use the pool, and difficult time making the room cooler (in this hotel, as in most NYC hotels, in the winter central heat is used, and the only way to cool off a room is to open a window - which presents a hazard to young children as there is no screen). I received excellent service from Lamiaa at concierge, and from Majda at frot desk.\\nThey were bot outstanding, patient and very efficient.\\nTheir performance must be recognized. The location is great, the check-in and check-out were fast and efficient. But nothing really special. \\nI think I was \"punished\" for asking for a quiet room on a higher floor, because when I said I wasn't interested in paying an extra $50/day for my pre-booked prepaid room (thru Expedia), I got stuck with a low floor, in the closest possible room to the elevator, LOL. I know asking for upgrades is always a crapshoot, and I am always polite, not demanding (I figure it never hurts to ask!), so that's fair--whatever, LOL. \\nOur room overlooked the massive construction site next door, but fortunately the site was stalled the 3 nights we stayed. (But keep in mind, that project is massive and will probably be going on much of the year. It may get LOUD, as others have noted.)\\nThe basic, king-bed room we stayed in was fine: very comfortable firm bed, no bedbugs, Philip Thomas Roth bath products.\\nThe hotel has an okay (not great) rooftop swimming pool, but it costs an extra $15 per family, per day, to use it (new policy implemented February 2012, although it's not on their website and the in-room facility description still lists the pool as complimentary). We went at night--nice city lights, looks like there's a nice deck for when the weather is nicer. But the pool itself is teensy, maybe 17 or 18 metres from end to end, about 5 metres across. The water quality was not great (and I say this as a certified lifeguard): very turbid and cloudy. I went in with my kid but we took soapy showers afterward. The lockerrooms adjoining the pool deck are great--filled with bath products and they have hair dryers so you could, in theory, get ready for dinner here (as we did) after our swim.\\nAll in all, it was okay-but-not-great. The parking cost $50/day, no in-out privileges.\\nArchitecturally, the lobby is very pretty, as is Nave, the onsite coffeeshop.\\nWould I stay again? Maybe. Dunno. It was all in all a very underwhelming experience, though not terrible either. Great place....excellent location...great staff....very nice rooms .....great bar lounge... I tried already a few Hotels around Times Square (New York) until I found the Le Parker Meridien. In my opinion it is an excellent choice for both business and leisure traveler. Friendly staff, speedy check in and check out, a good breakfast to start your day…what you want more…? I can only recommend this Hotel! Really great stay all round... Great room, great pool, great breakfasts at Normas really friendly and charming staff fantastic location- walk all day and night to Central park, theater district and Times Square, zillions of restaurants and attractions. Very adequate room size considering you are in midtown Manhattan. Accomodations are very modern with clean and updated bathrooms, furniture, etc. 2 great food spots inside the lobby- Norma's for incredible brunch and the delicious hamburger joint known city-wide. Hotel guests receive special attention at these busy restaurants. We had a junior suite and an adjoining room. Which worked out for 3 kids and 3 adults. Great rooftop pool, but why charge for it? Good burger joint called the knave. Very convenient that we could rent a stroller, would definitely return for another stay perfect location near central park/5th ave/rockefeller centre.\\nsubway at end of street made it easy to get around the rest of manhattan.\\nbest burger joint in hotel lobby\\nroom had a view of central park Hotel has a great location. Rooms are clean and have a decent size (for NYC)\\nBathroom very small but ok.\\nConstant background noise in the room even though the thermostat was off.\\nWifi is expensive\\nStay away from Norma's to have breakfast, Too expensive , average of $35 per person. I've never written a review of a hotel, though I rely on TripAdvisor all the time. I've chosen to write because of the terrible customer service that I received here and the ridiculously outdated rooms that are straight from the 1960s. In addition, the bellmen damaged my laptop while it was in storage for the afternoon.\\nThis hotel is not up to SPG standards. Overall, great ambience and most of the staff were also excellent. Location was superb.\\nRoom was very well finished and stylish. Good size for NYC.\\nMy only issue would be that for a quality hotel (and it is not the cheapest), I would expect seamless service and facilities. Not having complimentary wifi throughout was a big disappointment for me (my travel agent told me it was) and also paying for the swimming pool. Would suggest the hotel doesn't try and squeeze out every last dollar and instead concentrate on providing a great overall package... Awesome hotel. Close to transport. Great dining optioms on site. Comfortable bed, attentive staff. Cant complain at all! Would pay a lot more to stay here again! Got room throgh priceline. it was a steal. We stayed here for 5 nights in February and although we had a great time there were a few things that made this hotel average rather than good. By far the best thing about this hotel is it's location; many main tourist attractions are within walking distance. We were given a room on the 27th floor on the 56th street side of the hotel. The room was quiet, due to it being at the end of the corridor and we had good views over the city. However, the room was on the small side and although clean, felt a little dated. The bathroom was fairly compact, but modern and again very clean. The biggest problem was that the room was very warm, whatever setting the heating was on. It did get slightly uncomfortable at night sometimes. As we didn't complain to the hotel when we were there I do feel a bit guilty about including this in the review as maybe they would have fixed this if we had asked. However, I have noticed this point in other reviews which is why I have decided to include it.\\nOn our last night at the hotel we decided to go and use the pool on the top floor, which is described in the hotel's in-room guide as being \"free to guests staying in the hotel\". It was also one of the reasons we chose to book this hotel in the first place. On arriving upstairs we were informed that the hotel had changed it's policy and have now started to charge guests of the hotel to use the facilities! We politely told the poor guy on the desk (who looked relieved that we weren't going to start shouting at him) that this was not acceptable as at the time of booking this wasn't the case/no information about this in room etc. After a few minutes he decided to let us in for free, but did inform us that this would only happen once. \\nThe pool was initially quite pleasant, but as I swam around did notice a couple of Elastoplast in one of the filters at the side of the pool and so decided to get out! The changing rooms made up for this slightly though as they had nice products to use and were very clean. The staff were also very friendly and the views from the pool area are great day or night. After our swim we decided to eat the takeout we had brought back earlier, but of course we hadn't got any cutlery. When we requested some we were told that there would be a $5 room service charge, which we did feel was a little cheeky! We probably would have given this amount as a tip anyway, but were told that there was no way round this charge. We decided to be slovenly and eat with our fingers.\\nI'll end on a compliment - the staff here are lovely and are always ready with a smile and good morning/afternoon. There are plenty of staff at the front desk, so check in would always be quick. Housekeeping do a great job and our room was cleaned by 11 am each day. They work really hard, but I think that sometimes hotel 'policy' seems to limit the service they are able to give. + localization!!!!\\n+ good burgers in the restaurant behind the curtains next to reception desk\\n- small room\\n- quite old hotel (should be renovated!!!) not like 5 stars hotel\\n- small swimming pools Le Parker Meridian has a lot of things going for it, including location, lobby ambience and a Starbucks across the street. But it also feels confused about whether it's a glorified Marriott or a discount Sofitel. My junior suite featured a lot of veneers and bold wall colors, and was reminiscent what was breakthrough design in the mid-90s--and the rotating, full-size TV cabinet is looking pretty dated. The bathroom, however, was outstanding. Wonderful central location, close to 5th Ave, Central Park, Times Square, etc... The room was comfortable with a great view of Central Park. \\nMy only negative remark would be about their business center which was just 2 computers at the end of the hallway with printer, copy and fax machine, all paid service. \\nWe had problems to print some important documents we needed and Ms Anandi (front desk) was very accommodating and professional in helping us use another wifi printer and bringing us the papers personally. \\nThe staff was attentive and excellent. We particularly enjoyed the hotel initiative to place a tv screen in the elevator showing old Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons and Charlie Chaplin films. It got the guests laughing and talking to one another all the time. Nice touch.\\nWill definitely come again. My New York office is a block and a half from Le Parker, so it's sort of my home away from home. From the first time I stayed here (many years ago, because the Hilton was oversold and put me up here) to today, the staff has consistently exceeded my expectations. Today, I worked in the room until 2 PM, yet when I came back tonight, the room was completely made up with new sheets. No annoying calls (I'm talking to you, Westin Las Vegas), no surprise of a messy room when I came back (I'm talking to you, both Swan and Dolphin Westins at Disney World). Every time I come to Le Parker, the staffing at the front desk is both sufficient enough so I don't have to wait 20 minutes (I'm talking to you, W Times Square) and friendly enough that they can snap me out of the irateness I feel after typical flight delays, instead of trying to pick a fight (I'm talking to you, Sheraton New York). The elevator wait is never unreasonable (I'm talking to you, Flatotel), and the location doesn't require a 3-mile walk (I'm talking to you, Ink48). The only place in Midtown with similarly good service is the Michelangelo, but it's often costlier and they don't have any meaningful rewards program. The rooms themselves are clean and modern, if a tiny bit dated at this point, but the upkeep and service more than make up for this. If you get an odd numbered room on floor 25 or higher, the Central Park views are breathtaking. In the years I have been coming here, they have never pissed me off, which is amazing because most hotels manage to do so in a single stay. I will keep coming back! The Parker Meridien consistently delivers a high quality service, room and experience, all set in a great European Inspired blend of function and design. Great location, great service, and great ambiance. 3rd year enjoying location, park view, Norma's for breakfast Hotel staff is very nice. Hotel hallways were quiet and the room was very comfortable. Great water pressure in the shower, fluffy towels, nice heavy sheets. The windows are very well insulated so the street noise is not disturbing\\nThe hotel is within walking distance to Central Park, Broadway, etc. Been coming to this hotel for over 16 years on business. Its a great hotel in a good location if you need to be in mid-town. The Burger Joint in the lobby is nice if you can get in, if not 5 Guys is around the corner. The rooms are starting to look tired. The furniture in the rooms is looking beat up and the old TV's don't help. I would come back here but I hope they update the hotel soon. Le Parker Meridian is located in the heart of Manhatten just near the central park, it has great rooms and a nice resturant with good food. This is a nice place to stay if you are visiting the city as all places are accessible from here. It was an official tour but I completely enjoyed my stay here. It's Starwood so I wondered...\"like a W, a Westin, a Sheraton?\" None of those actually. And that's just fine. This hotel had great \"bones\" in its cross between old and new worlds. Gorgeous views of Central Park (ask for Tower Rooms). Capable and quietly elegant, but with some age wrinkles showing. The pool on the top floor seems a bit of a waste, better suited perhaps for a bar, but the pool attendant couldn't have been nicer. Strange to see Charlie Chaplin movies playing in the elevator...I missed the connection. Room modern and comfortable. Nice bath amenities. Even a grocery store -- a FULL regular grocery store -- only three blocks away. Steps from Central Park. If you want that location, this place would be hard to beat. One note: much has been made of the burger bar just off the lobby. Cult like status even. If you're hungry for a burger you can do much better. The room is divey and fun, they play the Ramones (edgy!), and the people working there are really nice and fun. I am picky about my burgers and I do not rank this one in my top ten. Shake Shack, Minetta Tavern, etc. all have this beat by a mile. If you have no time to go elsewhere...by all means. This is the second time we've stayed at the Meridien and we've enjoyed it both times, using it as a brief holiday to relax after traveling and before visiting family. I give it an excellent rating bc we use our starwood points and the hotel staff treats us just as attentively as they would their paying guests.\\nThe hotel staff is incredibly friendly, helpful and personable.. we got to know a few of the staff during our brief stay and it made the grand hotel feel cozier. Rooms felt spacious, beds are comfortable - having a view of the park is a treat. We used the newly renovated gym which was great. Close to everything and the location is perfect.. I used to live downtown so staying in the area close to the park feels like being on holiday while it's convenient to all the major subways. Nice room, ample by NYC standards, with great amenities and modern, comfortable, and very attractive furnishings. Nice midtown location. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Even the doormen tried to help us find affordable parking for guests that were visiting us at the hotel. The rooms were very clean and beautifully furnished. Bathroom modern and updated, very pretty. Bed very comfortable Room size very good, especially for a NY hotel. Wonderful location.\\nEnjoyed stay very much. This price is affordable in the middle of Manhattan. Even though we live in NY, we really enjoyed our \"stay-cation\" at the Parker Meridian. It was great to be mid-town and do \"touristy\" things and stay in a really nice hotel. Food was great - Burger Joint and room service for dinner and Norma's for breakfast. Hotel is super kid-friendly - even the elevators have cartoons playing. Really fun to swim in the middle of winter and view is outstanding from the pool. I definitely recommend. The Parker Meridian is a very good place to stay with children in NYC. Our daughters enjoyed the coloring books and crayons they were given when we checked in, as well as watching enjoyable, old cartoons in the elevators. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable, but slightly outdated. The pool and the view from the pool area is simply incredible. There are also great shopping and family friendly attractions conveniently located nearby. New York hotels are pretty expensive and can vary somewhat in quality. Le Parker Meridien is a good all round reliable hotel - not particularly special but it has a lot of things going for it.\\nThe location is very convenient, a block from Central Park and not far from the subway. The room size is decent though the bathroom is on the small side and the decor in need of freshening up. The gym is excellent - fantastic size and everything you could want including good classes and a huge free weights area.\\nThe breakfast at Normas is great though expensive (and very busy) so splash out there when you feel like it but if you want a simpler, much cheaper breakfast you can go to Dean &amp; Delucas across the street Over the years I have stayed at many NYC hotels. Most are overrated! The Parker Meridian is a gem. Great value. Excellent guest relations - especially Lisa, Lawrence and the front desk team! And they are completing a renovation of the gym. Well located with access on both 56th and 57th makes it easy to head any direction. \\nI highly recommend the hotel when in NYC! I've been staying at this hotel for years and it just gets better and better. The rooms are large, comfortable and quiet, the staff is friendly and helpful and it is centrally located to everywhere I need to be when in Manhattan on business. Our first time, and a great experience. Nothing whatsoever to fault - clean as a whistle, friendly staff (from front desk to pool attendants), in the middle of everything location-wise, nice breakfast, nice bar (The Vault). Be sure to go to the pool for the view - Central Park is lovely from that altitude! I've enjoyed staying here for years - the rooms are nice, the staff is very helpful, the Burger Joint on ground level is really good, and a Norma's breakfast is fun and delicious. The pool on the roof is very nice, though they've now introduced a fee for it - makes me uncertain about using it. Victoria Barr at the Parker in New York was wonderful to work with. The entire staff did a great job and the Burger Joint is an added plus. Location was ideal for our trip. It was close to subways, Central Park and easy to get around. The eclectic hotel had a nice vibe. \\nWe would come there again! Good location and nice hotel. Nice restaurant, gym, and staff I have been staying at this property for the past three years and really only have great things to say about it. The staff is wonderful and you will realize this the minute you check-in. Everyone from the front desk, to the bellman, to the phone operators are pleasant and extremely polite. Emilie Anchilles has been my go to for everything and she has gone above and beyond to make the hotel feel like my home away from home. I have also worked with Lisa Thorpe and she too has been great. The location of the hotel is amazing, blocks from mid-town offices and during the warm months you're only two blocks away from the Park. They also just completely remodeled their gym \"Gravity\" and it looks great. I have stayed at a bunch of properties in NYC, but the Parker Meridien always has me coming back!! \\nTim M. Here is a great hotel with wonderful service, located in Midtown NY. Starting with the staff at the front desk, you'll be welcomed personally as I was by Edwin and Emily. Lisa Thorpe in guest relations is always available for special needs or request. No matter where you want to venture in NY, the Parker Meredian is close by. Try the Burger Joint in the lobby, a well known secret by New Yorkers as the best burger in the city. You could spend more on a room in NY but why? Central Park jog? Check.\\nConcert next door at Carnegie Hall? Check. \\nBusiness meetings at 30 Rock? Check.\\nShopping at Uniqlo? Check.\\nArt scene at MoMA? Check.\\nLive taping of The Daily Show? Check. \\nAll within walking distance.\\nOh and the staff was so attentive. \\nThe view from the hotel was great. The desk provided a great location for working. \\nThe room decorations are a bit dated. The infrastructure is starting to show its age (just slightly) but this is much better than the Sheraton Hotel and Towers or the Hilton. Not as nice as the W on Lexington, but not as expensive either. And the whole scene there is a bit pretentious. \\nOh, did I mention the lounge at Le Parker Meridien? Nice lounge. \\nGreat burger joint there in the lobby as well. \\nThat said, the restroom off the lobby leaves MUCH to be desired. \\nOverall very nice! It's a nice hotel. has some very cool features like the barber shop, top floor pool and a great burger bar just off the lobby. Rooms are stylish but could use a little upgrading in the bathroom dept. I will stay here again. As a frequent visitor to NYC I've come to enjoy the location and consistency this hotel offers. Although we used my husbands starwood miles to pay for this, the room we stayed in was awful, Talk about cheap and second class. Was awful, reminded me of an office block. Stains on the carpet, bed awful, so uncomfortable. There was building work going on when we got there which actually frustrating but didnt bother me that much, but annoyingly we did not get told when booked.\\nPerson who checked us in was great though.\\nHotel bar is also very disapointing, service slow and atmosphere none existent.\\nWould not stay again awful place and would not recommend. This was a nice hotel. I have nothing bad to say about it. The staff was friendly, and rooms were clean and comfortable. The rooms are a modern deco and large for New York. The bell staff were very friendly and took care of their guests. You do have to ask for the wifi access. If you don't pay for it an advance or have it in price, you will need to pay $17.00 a day per device. Keep that in mind. The bar is amazing, you feel as if you stepped back in time. Ornate walls, and mirrors with cathedral style ceilings and marble floors. It's a lovely experience. You can see central park from certain parts of the hotel. I would stay there without complaints again. Stayed in junior suite with two teens, nice size rooms with great bathrooms. Location is ideal if you like walking around - couple of blocks from Central Park, so we spent a lot of time there. We also walked down to Times Square and Rockefeller Plaza, but its too far with young kids. Restaurants are pricey, even by NYC standards, but there are lots of options around the immediate area - great Thai place around the corner. Front desk was quick and welcoming at check in, room was very clean and well maintained - beds were very comfortable.\\nPool is at the top of the hotel, with gorgeous views of Central Park. From all the rave reviews I've read over the past year on Parker Meriden I finally was able to get a room this past trip and was sorely disappointed with the overall quality of the rooms, the sheets, the small beds and the overall wear and tear of the place. The fitness room was being remodeled with lots of banging and hammering with no locker rooms or bathrooms to use while we were there and they still charged me the typical $10. The pool was MUCH smaller than they advertise and I was so disgusted that I shortened my 3 night stay to one and walked down to the Sheraton Towers on 7th where I got a bigger, newer room with Great Bedding, lots of free internet, a much nicer concierge and a brand new fitness center for morning workouts, for just $199/nt.--- $100 less than the Parker. Wouldn't EVER go back to Parker Meriden again. Over rated and swarmed with Asia tour bus types. Definitely nothing special. Not a 4 star boutique hotel that they advertise. That was ongoing during my visit with them it would have been nearly perfect. \\nI have to state that normally this is one of my normal haunts in the city. Rooms are incredibly spacious, bed is comfortable, staff is efficient, and it is in an area that I enjoy. My last trip in though - last week of September, I almost left the hotel within my first hour there and vowed to never return. Not because of the staff, nor because of the overall surroundings, but from the moment I walked in the sound of ongoing construction vibrated so loudly that by the time I was done checking in, my head was hurting so badly that I was nearly in tears. \\nIt was absolutely horrendous and unacceptable. The staff informed me that I would not hear it or be bothered by it in my suite so I proceeded to check in, also due to the fact that my room was already paid in advance for several days. \\nWhen I got into the room, again, very spacious, I found a note on the bed informing me that during the day, not to be alarmed if I was to see construction workers or firemen outside of my window, and not to worry, they were used to seeing people disrobed. Now I was pissed. I didn't care if THEY were used to it, I was NOT and again found it unacceptable that I had not been informed of this prior. It basically meant that during my stay I had to keep my curtains drawn the entire time, which I was not pleased about. \\nThe experience was truly unacceptable, and I may have over looked it if management had been somewhat gracious in regards to the situation, sending a bottle of wine to the room or maybe allowing for a later checkout, something to acknowledge that while the situation in regards to the construction was not their doing, they still were concerned overall for their guest comfort...ahem, and their hard earned money. But this was not the case, it was basically a \" well your screwed, were sorry about it, but it's your problem, not ours.\" \\nAnd that is a shame, as my children and I absolutely have loved staying here in the past. as well as the one in LA, where my children and I love taking a brisk swim over looking the city while basking n the sunlight and the all white rooms.... but due to their negligence in providing a comfort level that is to be expected at a Le Parker Meridien, we very well may find a new hotel to call our favorite. This was my first time in New York and it was WONDERFUL to stay so close to so many places. The hotel is walking distance (less than 20 minutes) from great places like Central Park (only 2 streets up), Times Sq, The Met, The MoMa, 5th Av,Broadway theatre district, and so much more! This is a good hotel, modern and young, I was on business travel so didn't have to worry too much about price, but it is not good for low budgets bc you have to pay for in-room internet and it's definitely not a low budget place, but if you have the money it is definitely worthy. I like to stay at The Parker. The service is great, its a good value, and the location in Midtown is ideal. The restaurant, Norma's is known for serving one of the best breakfasts in the city and the reputation is deserved. Bring your appetite because the portions are huge. I also like the coffee bar off the lobby. The only real negative is the rooms. The decor is very dated and they need to be updated. They are clean and all, and the beds are pretty comfortable, but a remodel is due. Location is excellent. Everything is within walking distance. We had a park view room which was nicely located on the 31st floor. The room was clean and bright. The size though at an average. The bar was a spot in the hotel we loved fery much. You can watch people strolling through the hotel and have excellent drinks. We'll definitively return to this hotel though might book a tower suite instead of the park view room for about a hundred bucks more. It's worth the money if you stay for one or two nights only and like the views (park and city). This hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to many sites in Midtown and close to subways for trips to neighbourhoods farther away. There are lots of great restaurants nearby as well as the theatre district. There is a Starbucks across the street on 56th and also a Dean and DeLuca a few doors down. The lobby is beautiful, great trendy (quirky!) burger joint behind a curtain off the lobby, and the lounge is a romantic and exotic place to have a drink at night.\\nThe rooms are nicely appointed and decorated with nice modern bathrooms. Staff were always very helpful. \\nOverall, great place to stay. Highly recommended. This is by far the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in in NYC. The staff from the desk clerks to the bell men and the door men were very friendly and nice. Our room was upgraded to a beautiful view of the park and it was spacious, comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. The location was very convenient in a great neighborhood! I would definitely stay here again and again! I have stayed at this hotel several times. On my most recent visit, the construction next door was deafening and so I specifically asked about it when I checked in. The fairly unfriendly person at the desk said that it no longer was a problem. Still, I was stunned when I went to my room, only to discover that it sat directly on top of the construction site. I went back to check in and an only slightly more friendly staff member changed me to the other side of the building. And neither room was Starwood Preferred (I'm Gold status), even though the hotel seemed far from fully occupied. Even though the hotel's location is very good, I'd rather stay somewhere where the staff seems to value my repeat business. We stayed in Le Parker Meridien when attending a military ball on Saturday night. We were well within walking distance to some great restaurants, the hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and the room comfortable and clean. TV was old - hummed and had fuzzy reception. But who cares, we had better stuff to do. Surprised my wife with an overnight stay at the Patker Méridien New York on West 56th Street this past weekend. Great hotel... Perfect location... Friendly &amp; welcoming staff. When the hotel learned that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary they gave us a lovely room on the 36th floor overlooking Central Park. Great views. The bathroom floor was a little dirty but we mentioned this to the chamber maid and she immediately apologized and took care of it right away. (She did say she wasn't on duty when the room was made up but she apologized for the other staff if we felt our room wasn't as spiffy as we expected.) Bustling restaurant. Lounge is one of the most beautiful rooms in the City! I have stayed at the Parker Meridian annually for the past 5 years. It is my NYC hotel of choice. It is chic, spotless and comfortable. The staff is friendly and efficient.The rooms are quiet, beautifully sleek and comfortable. Location is excellent.I would not stay anywhere else! The Le Parker Meridien is a great hotel. The interior design is cool the way Palm Springs is cool....it's from a past but recent era, but it was cool then, and it's cool now. And, it is in very well-preserved condition. The room was spotless. The view of Central Park from the 32nd floor was tremendous. Even the toiletries in the room were top-notch. I will stay here on every trip to New York City from now on. Stayed one night for business. Starwood upgrade gave us a generous sized room, small bathroom. Clean. Heating worked well. Loved the umbrella in the closet - it poured rain the whole time I was there. Staff was approachable and helpful. Great wifi reception on 17th floor. Lobby was not a usual Le Meridian style, and was not inviting. Design of lobby into bar or into restauarant did not transition well. Stay was a good value for a great location, easy walking distance to Park, stores, Broadway. Would stay here again. The Parker Meridian is a well located, good sized hotel with an outstanding staff and the best hotel gym I have experienced. The reception staff is consistently warm, upbeat and helpful. The hotel has a slightly hip buzz, which it cultivates in everyting from its \"Do Not Disturb\" signs (\"Fuhgeddaboutit\") to placards apologizing for a piece of out-of-order gym equipment (\"Kaput\"). Some of the rooms are spacious by NY standards, others are just average sized, but none require the skills of a contortionist to navigate them the way other NY hotel rooms can. The room decor and finishes are getting a bit tired, and could use freshening up, but the rooms are comfortable and offer a good desk layout. The Gravity gym in the basement of the hotel is well equipped and spacious by hotel gym standards, and is my major reason for returning repeatedly. The burger joint serves some of the best, and certainly the best priced, burgers in the city. this is a great hotel. the staff is helpful, courteous and professional. the rooms are really nice, clean and well-sized for nyc. the room service and restaurants are expensive but the food and service are both very good. it's a pleasure staying at this hotel from check-in to check-out. You can't beat the location of this hotel...bang in the middle of some of NYC's famous attractions (Central Park, Rockfeller Ctr, 5th ave shopping, Met, etc)...and they charge a premium for it. The room itself was small (comfortable by NY's standard) but, you could tell that it was old and needed upgrades. It seems that the hotel's being rennovated (construction and the noise that accompanies it all day long). I'd say avoid the hotel 'til the rennovations are complete. The remodel of the penthouse meeting room is something to behold; truly breathtaking backdrop to any presentation or event. The beds are comfortable, and the rooms are clean. I love the burger place in the lobby, but room service is a little pricy. The hotel is a bit over rated, and given the price not sure its worth it. The rooms are a tad faded, and could definitly do with a make-over, and the concierge / reception was unpersonal and lacked friendliness. Also, another lift would be good,had to wait atleast 15 minutes for elevator each morning.\\nHowever, on the plus side, the location is great slap bang in manhattan, and you cant really beat the roof top pool, which is great for a morning swim. I have stayed here several times now and will pick it as often as I can get a good rate, relative to other nice spots nearby. I am always impressed at check-in with their \"Welcome Back Mr. ___\". This time I messed up and did not put two people on my reservation and did not even know it included breakfast. Our check-in host made sure we got the proper certificates to both get the free breakfasts. That is no small deal as breakfast at Norma's can easily run $30-40 a person, but is worth it. No kidding, this may be one of the top breakfast spots in the world. I have never seen so many diners taking pictures of their breakfast plates. But they are pretty awesome. Back to the hotel - the Jr. Suites are a great choice in Manhattan for this location if you can get them at a good price. Good space, nicely appointed, a bit contemporary but very comfortable with room to move around. Everything is nearby as you can take a hearty but doable walk to Broadway theaters, Art museum, Nat. Hist. museum, and of course Central Park, Columbus circle, shopping and plenty of really good restaurants are so close. Also, the lounge is a comfortable, fun spot to watch folks go by, Norma's is a \"must do\", and the hamburger joint is quirky spot, with OK food but fun and unique to have right in the lobby. I've been staying here off and on since the mid-90s. Recently returned for a longish stay for first time in three years. Pleasantly surprised to find things in good nick. If you luck into a high floor it can be pretty quiet and restful for midtown. Only issue is tech: the wi-fi is extra and per device. The TV's are turn-of-the-century, which would not be so bad if they had better connections. On my latest stay, there were annoying sound problems with the NBC signal and a snowy picture for the ABC affiliate. the hotel bar is excellent: great atmosphere, decor, etc. And the drinks are damn good too. Good locale &amp; friendly staff. My only big issue? They seemed to blatantly ignore the well-established \"eco-ing\" of hotels. No recycle bins in rooms (Kimpton does), nothing re reduced water use, heat, energy etc. This is not 1983. Traveled to NYC for the first time to meet friends and sightsee. Le Parker Meridien was a great choice for us. The location was wonderful. We were close to Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, shops, restaurants, etc. The rooms were of modern design. Clean and comfortable. Hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. The Parker Meridien is a wonderful hotel. I have stayed with them twice for business trips to NY and have had the same, great experience with each visit. Traveling alone to New York from the Midwest, I feel very comfortable, safe and at home at the Parker. The location cannot be beat, the rooms are modern and clean, the gym is amazing and the staff are all very helpful and friendly. Loved the view of Central Park and really enjoyed the 5 day stay... Once again! Thank you! Clean, upscale, sophisicated and modern describe the environment and atmosphere. The Burger Joint (tucked away on the main floor) is a best kept secret and the toiletries provided are of the quality I like to have when I travel (and have forgotten something) i.e, glycerin soap, good quality lotion, etc. Location convenient to shopping and offices. Disappointed by the \"old style\" TV in my room. Flat Screen TVs are what I expected from this brand. What you expect from Meridien - large entryway, marble, retro signage etc; and the service was great. They have a fairly large gym, and a great \"Burger Joint\" in lobby - albeit tiny place with limited seating. The bar scene has nice low lighting driving some good ambience (so less cold hotel feel and tad more hip than some places). Nearby are some good quick stop shop kind of places to bulk up on water, etc for the room. Prices for food are ridiculous at Le Parker (Breakfast for one after charges and tip to room etc was $40+ and we are talking about eggs and bacon here). No good diner nearby either to run too...just Starbucks on every corner. No coffee maker in room. Mini bar but didn't look at prices after I saw the room service. Fairly quiet hotel. Rooms are quite large and well appointed, but again, old CRT Tvs with very poor picture quality which is unacceptable for this day and age especially with the low cost of TVs currently. I was very pleased with this hotel overall. I found the staff to be very nice, professional and efficient. I found room service, laundry service, and housekeeping to be worth the cost of the room. I will concede that the decor in the room a dated, but I still like this place overall and would gladly stay there again Le Parker Meridien is a very well located hotel and the rooms are clean and comfy. But the staff is not as friendly as the website says, the breakfast is very expensive (thanks for the Starbucks and Dean and Delluca nearby) and the internet is paid (VERY WELL PAID). It's nice to have the Joint Burger so close, but I don't want to be charged for the wifi in a hotel anymore. It's insane. We chose this hotel to spend a week in New York doing the tourist trails over the new year period. After seven nights in a Junior Suite we left Le Parker Meridian feeling disappointed with their customer service offering and our overall experience. So you know a bit about our choice you should know we looked for hotel location and for quality / comfort. \\nWhat Le Parker Meridian Delivered Well:\\nThe Junior Suite was a good size for big city standards. Don't get too excited it's not cheap, even by NY standards. There were some poorly performed maintenance jobs (carpet not fitted around TV cables etc) which should not be expected in any room type. \\nRoom Service was again not cheap but they delivered a reasonable quality within 20-30 mins. The price was not better than going to a 4-5 star restaurant. \\nRoom Cleaning was excellent, the house keeping team were flexible and friendly. They worked hard and always left the room in an excellent condition.\\nWhere some work needs to be done in our opinion:\\nHaving stayed in a raft of different types of hotels from the humble Premier Inn's to some of the best all inclusive resorts in the Caribbean and many in between both for business and pleasure we have some experience of varying quality in customer services and attitude. Often the rule applies that you get what you pay for. Not so here.\\nWe had too many bad attitudes and lackluster responses to simple requests for this to be a snap shot or bad day. Clearly the reception and main customer facing staff need to receive some training in who the customer is and what they represent to them, their wages and the brand they are representing. \\nTo be fair in this review we had two excellent staff members, the head of concierge and our house keeper. They could teach their colleuges some inexpensive but very valuable lessons. Sadly in any customer focused environment the poorest performing people lower the standards and customer experience - a fact that no hotel manager can escape.\\nThere seems to be a recurring problem at this hotel that we sadly also experienced: They use a detergent which will irritate anyone with even slightly sensitive skin. We are not too precious about this but due to the red, itching patches appearing on our legs and arms we were convinced we had bed bugs. After another night of itching they despatched a pest controller who checked the room, bed etc thoroughly and found no trace of bed bugs - Great news! The worrying comments made from the head of house keeping prompted this detail to our report. She told us that they have many bed bug issues AND many complaints from guests who are irritated by the detergent they use on their linen. This prompts the question: WHY? We self medicated by buying an expensive 'calming creme' but for the price per night this is very poor. In New York city and in a higher end hotel, I believe that this is simple to rectify by using a better quality linen / detergent. \\nWe also experienced another negative at this hotel. Our credit card was cloned and a matter of hours following check out $500 was charged to our card by another hotel in New Jersey (our credit card company confirmed this was done over the phone not in person). Le Parker Meridian was the only place to take our card details (and store them) and know our travel arrangement. Although there may be some response to this review from the management, this hotel has a big problem, one which honest travellers should be aware of. By the time we saw the fake charge we were back in the UK and we are letting the card company deal with the fraud their end. I decided not to call the hotel (at my further expense) from the UK to report this to them as I would not know who to trust. Again as already commented this is (hopefully) one dishonest member of staff but our experience was poor.\\nWifi is charged at $16 per day AND per device NOT room. We felt in these days of multiple wifi reliant devices this is unfair to guests paying a premium. The wifi is free in the lobby for unto 30 mins but its free for as long as you want in most coffee shops so they are being very stingy in our opinion and compared to other worldwide hotels.\\nLe Parker Meridian's website is a far cry from what they deliver. We really wanted the experience they offered but sadly it was disappointing and not a hotel we would consider revisiting again.\\nFeel free to ask any questions via in mail if you need further detail. If you choose to stay at the Parker, you are choosing wisely. Positioned perfectly in Midtown, I love the access to the Park and the views when I am lucky enough to stay on that side. Being a Starwood Platinum member, the Parker offers something I don't get a lot of which is a very unique experience. The service is also top-notch without being stuffy and makes you realize how bad it is at other places.\\nThe food options in-room, at the Burger Joint, coffee and drinks at Knave and Norma's create a combination that is unmatched in my travels to other NY hotels, you could stay for days and just eat!\\nOn my third visit, I realized I did not have HD TV in the room, but opting for a jog in the Park is a better option anyway. I will return whenever I can to the Parker, it is my hotel of choice in NYC. I have stayed at the Le Parker Meridien in NYC many times. The hotel is in a wonderful location just off Sixth Avenue on 56th Street - vey convenient to almost everthing New York has to offer. The rooms are on the small side, but fully updated.\\nThe hotel is my choice on all my trips to New York.\\nOn the side, the Health Club is going through a complete renovation which will be completed shortly. This is a modern hotel with a very European feel. We stayed using Starpoints in a room that was billed as 2 twin beds...thought this a little strange and was wary, but the beds were quite large and comfortable for one person and the room was spacious and worked well. Staff were very helpful. We stayed during the time of nearby construction -didn't appreciate this when we booked, and didn't appreciate the noice that woke us up at 7am - but when I mentioned it at checkout, incidentals were taken off the bill, which was a nice surprise, and I received an email saying the noisey construction apparently is now over. The hotel is an easy walk from 5th avenue, lots of good restaurants close. We didn't sample the famous burgers -didn't really know about them until checkout when we say a big line for them, but if you want to sample, apparently you can order ahead. It was busy when we were there, and the elevators were crowded but would definitely go back. Considering the huge number of hotels in NYC, we won't be staying here again. Pros: Front Desk (Lawrence) and view of Central Park. Cons: Cramped dark room, aweful television, hair in bathroom sink (prior quest), constant noise from elevators running, no coffee maker in room (not even bottled water for Starwood Gold Preferred members). Starwood should be ashamed of keeping this property in its portfolio. I suppose the best compliment one can give to any business is to do business with them again even when there are other choices available. I wil certainly and gladly stay at this hotel again. The staff, the facility and the comfortable feel of the hotel are terrific. From the front door to the bell station, check-in, concession shop, bar staff, etc, this staff have your comfort and best experience possible forefront in their minds. It is evident by the manner in which they work with you at every turn. The convenience and location are perfect for any mid-town shopping and restaurant activities. \\nThe room was wonderful. Modern without being too cliche. Comfortable bed, beautiful view, low noise between rooms and great room staff. \\nTry this hotel. You will be very glad you did. The hotel is very nice. Rooms have a modern feel. The staff is very nice and very accommodating. We stayed on the fifth floor, which is low, facing the street. The street noise did bleed into the room, especially when taxis laid in on their horns. In the end, it didn't matter much to us but if you're a light sleeper, it might be a factor for you. \\nMy wife and I stayed here with our two kids. We asked for a room with two beds. The beds that were in the room could generously be described as \"super-twin\" beds. It would be a stretch to call them double beds or full beds. Even our kids, who are both under 10, said the next morning that the beds were really small. Once I got settled in, the bed was comfortable enough. And since I don't move much when I sleep, it didn't bother me as much. Since the beds were so small, I called the front desk to ask for a cot. They said that because of a fire code, they were not allowed to let us have a cot in the room. I wasn't sure if that was true or not. After pressing, they said even if they could get a cot into the room, it would be $40. That seemed a little steep so we passed on it.\\nOne good thing about the room is that there are outlets everywhere. So if you have a lot of phones, computers, iPads, etc. to charge, you will have no problem finding an outlet to plug in. Also, there is a small desk with a Herman Millar office chair. So if you have to do some work while you are staying in the room, the working area, while on the small side, is comfortable.\\nI noticed that I could hear the people in the next room when they used any water, whether it was flushing the toilet, taking a shower or using the sink. To minimize the noise going into the room, I closed the door of our bathroom. That was effective in dampening the noise though I was not expecting to have to do that. \\nThe pool on the top floor is a nice treat. Even if you don't go up to swim, you should go up to see the view of Central Park to the north. To get up there, you have to go up to the 22nd floor and then change elevators to go the rest of the way. When we stayed there, there must have been some glitch in the system because the second set of elevators took a long time. It took 15-20 minutes for an elevator to even get to the 22nd floor. When it finally arrived, it was literally packed full. We were able to squeeze in the front but it was uncomfortably full for everyone. Then, the elevator proceeded to stop at almost every floor. On some floors, a group of people were waiting for an elevator. You could see their faces drop when they saw how full the elevator was. On other floors, there was no one waiting at all. After waiting about 15-20 mins to get the elevator, it literally took another 15-20 mins to get up to the top floor. And I think we may have skipped only two floors out of 22 on the way up. The people who were in the elevator at first were even more frustrated than we were. My kids forgot their goggles back on the fifth floor. But rather than take the elevator, I walked down 22 flights of stairs and took the lower elevator down to the fifth floor. Then, on the way up, I took the elevator from the fifth to the 22nd floor. Then, rather than wait for the elevator, I walked back UP 22 flights of stairs. It's just my opinion, but I think I got there more quickly by walking then I would have by waiting. It's kind of a minor issue but it's the kind of issue that sticks out in your memory. From this day forward, when our kids talk about that hotel, they'll be saying to each other, \"That's the hotel where the elevator took forever, remember?\" So even though the rest of the hotel was very nice, this is unfortunately what we will be remembering about the hotel.\\nAssuming the elevator issue is not an issue, I would recommend anyone to stay here. We got a good deal and given the location of the hotel, in all reality, it was a good choice for us. I have stayed at the Le Parker Meridien twice and both were very nice times. The rooms are nothing too exciting. That's my only negative thing. Just expect the rooms to have more of a flair and they are dull in decor. The breakfast is to die for. Make sure to get their orange juice. I swear they gave orange trees in their kitchen. Oh yummmmy!!!its located next to Carnegie Hall and many celebrities stay here. You might catch one. I got to Jason Mraz. Woohoo. I hear the burger place in the hotel is amazing. I've never eaten because I'm not a huge burger fan. But if you are, this is supposed to be a great stop. Love, love, love this place. Rooms have a simple, understated, modern elegance. I was upgraded with a million dollar Central Park view inside a large (by NYC standards) room. Great toiletries from Peter Thomas Roth. Everyone from doorman to housekeeping, concierge to front desk, pool person to bartender is very friendly and always says a casual \"good morning\" when they see you. It's in a stupendous location, very central if you need to see people uptown or downtown, but far enough away from Times Sq to, well, be far enough away from Times Sq. Many subway lines to almost anywhere just steps away. But my favorite part is the close proximity (3 short blocks) for runs in Central Park. Excellent value for what you get. I invited a friend who works for Frommers, and who just wrote a guidebook for them, up to my room and he was very impressed! Very efficient and well located hotel. Rooms are comfortable and quiet. Nice pool. Norma's Restaurant has the best breakfast anywhere. Good hotel for casual or business visitor Great get away hotel for our family from Connecticut. Enclosed rooftop pool a top priority for kids, The Burger Joint comes in a close second. Staff has always been accomodating when asked for a favor. Perfect location, within walking distance to everything. We always have a wonderful time at Le Parker Meridan. We've stayed here many times even through the noisy renovations which are now complete and have always been delighted. The staff is always polite and helpful. The Hotel location is very well suited for our family needs. It's located right in the middle of mid-town with exits onto 56th and 57th streets. The rooms are very nice, modern and up to date, and very well maintained. Many rooms on 57th street have a view of the park. If you enjoy breakfast, don't miss Norma's. If you enjoy burgers, don't miss the Burger Joint. If you want to relax, go to the Knave. Enjoy coffee, tea and drinks. We were a family of 4 who stayed here during the Xmas holidays. This hotel has a great location being close to central park, 5th avenue,couple of subway stations to Times Square etc. That is the best thing about this hotel. Also,the pool on the 42nd floor is amazing.\\nHowever,the bad things are that they don't have any double beds for example for a family of 4 or more.What they offer with an upgrade of room is a king bed( which I honestly think was the size of queen bed) along with a sofa bed. Both the bed and the sofa bed are old,flemsy and so uncomfortable. They are millions of years away from the beds we are used sleeping on at hotels such as Hyatt or Hilton etc or any of the resorts in CA.\\nI would rate the beds as the worst about this hotel.\\nThe other bad thing is the restaurant downstairs.The staff are unfriendly. We had breakfast there only once and never went back. Once we were finally sitting down at out table and the server took out orders of simple pancakes and cereal, we had to wait almost an hour for our food to arrive.The server didn't even say a simple sorry for the delay. It is a very pricy restaurant.Pancakes go for $22. Perhaps if the service was good or the food arrived fast, it would still be possible to justify it being it's Manhattan but I'm afraid not.Other day we ate at other restaurants close by with much better service and much better prices.We particularly like cafe Europa just outside the hotel. Perfect location for all things NYC, whether business or pleasure - this is a great spot! A top-tier hotel at a very reasonable room rate. One is not overpaying for the cachet of the Le Meridien name. We only interacted with the reception desk staff and they were more than friendly and helpful. The requests that we made when reserving online were honored and we were informed of this at the time we checked in. The room was spacious. Excellent desk space and task chair if you are there on business. The TV could be rotated for viewing from many angles. Spacious bathroom. More closet storage space than many NYC hotels. I guess it's my Midwest sensibility, but I'm always underwhelmed by accommodations in NYC, and this is no exception. The strength is its location--a relative oasis in Midtown, near the park, subway, theater... everywhere. And the staff is efficient and... just great. I know the construction is just temporary and not their fault, but when I was there in November, there was drilling on a Sunday at 7 am. I regularly slept through fire alarms and I couldn't sleep through this. And \"temporary\" I don't think means like a few days. I think it means months to a year of foundation work. I ate breakfast elsewhere, but the dining area is obviously insufficient, the spa closed while I was there, the lobby hardly obvious, sheathed in scaffolding. I would stay there again in the future (like a year from now), but I would call first and see about the general state of things. As for the reviewer who mentioned closing certain areas of the hotel... My understanding is that the most tedious of work is next door, not in the hotel, and at least from when I was there the noise is so loud that no part of the hotel is safe. I was on the 29th floor and still hurting. The room? Large for NY but kind of sterile. I did get a peek of a higher floor room, and that was better. Other than the front desk staff, the other high point was the bar on a weeknight. Perfect location, great staff, Rooms are very nice. loved it. The one night stay for a work trip to NY was ruined due to the buolding works going on. In hindsight, they should have closed down those sections of the hotel affected by what felt like someone was directly above and under you. I understand the work has now been completed, but it meant I did not sleep well, and for the price we paid, I think it was not value for money at all. That aside, service and the actual room were ok, but not spectacular.I do have to stay here again in the next couple of months because we have a corporate account with them... so we shall see. The location, the service, the rooms- excellent -just what I expect from Le Meridien... Great hotel. Mini suites could have used two tv's one for the sitting area/roll out and one for the bedroom. I am a platinum spger and have stayed here several times due to the location. Never again! We arrived on dec 26 after checkin time (4pm) yet our room was not ready despite having called to confirm after we landed as we were on a tight time frame. No upgrade - busy time of year. After being late to our event we were looking forward to sleeping in before brunch. Ah no way. The jack hammers started at 7! the entire building shook. I awoke in a panic- earthquake (we used to be californians). No warning despite the fact i booked shortly in advance and by phone. No warning when we checked in. After 2 mornings of this we decided to find somewhere else to stay and enjoy our final night of vacation. When i called down to the front desk they said not only would they not refund our final night but would charge us extra if we left early. Simply unbelievable. Naturally we put the do not disturb sign out and left for some blissful rest elsewhere at great expense. Terrible experience made worse by the hotel's poor handling of a bad situation. Good size rooms (for New York) and everything you would expect. Really busy with lots of business folk most of the time, I'm told. No coffee maker or tea facilities in room,until I complained and it was sorted but this is ridiculous in a hotel of this stature. Room service expensive. The breakfast diner is wildly expensive and food moderate. $86 for the 2 of us for a so so breakfast. For $86 I would expect the works!\\nAll in all they are used to expense accounts and not worrying about the tab...\\nThe secret Burger joint was always busy...long lines when we were there (just after Christmas) so has a reputation, but didn't dine there...\\nLocation was excellent , next to Carnegie Hall, and a short walk to Lincoln Center where we had tickets for a concert;also Broadway shows an easy walk away...saw Alan Rickman in \"Seminar\" ... so the location could not be better.... We loved this hotel. There are some reviews stating that the decor is a bit faded. Personally we hope that they do not \"modernise\" it any time soon. It has real quality and character.\\nOviously the bit problem at the moment is the noise. In our case the hotel was top notch in getting us a suite on the quiet side of the hotel - five star. However I am afraid to say that if you cannot get a room on the quiet (South Side) of the hotel I could not recommend that you stay here - my wife had a head ache in the first hour and you litterly cannot hear yourself speak.\\nThe hotel is doind its very best with the situation but if you have a noisy room you just cannot enjoy your stay. My family has had the pleasure of staying at Le Parker Meridien in NYC on 2 occasions and both visits have been exceptional! Super location on 56th Street near metro station. Very spacious, clean, modern rooms. Super nice staff. Really, we've stayed in lots of hotels (usually 4+ stars) during our family vacations in places across the US and this hotel ranks right at the top. There is also a top-rated burger joint on site--we did not eat there, but noticed lots of people in line waiting to get in. Thanks, Le Parker Meridien, for another great stay! Stayed here New Year's 2011/12. Excellent location as I was using the hotel as a launching pad to explore the city. Stayed on the 40th floor, they do an excellent job catering to platinum members, but I assume that same service is available to everyone. The rooms were large and very well appointed. My only complaint would be that the bedroom was smaller than I would have thought, even with double bed. The suite was really set up to only sleep in the bedroom and spend the rest of your time elsewhere. Some things were a bit pricey (haircut was reasonable, the restaurant not as much). The burger joint inside the hotel is fantastic, a real touch of character. Also, the windows opened, which is quite impressive.\\nHowever, what really set this apart was the service. New Year's can be crazy in New York, but I always felt served promptly and quickly. Apart from the concierge desk being understaffed, I was able to have all sorts of random requests serviced very quickly by the front desk. Very professional, which was appreciated! Thanks again! The only bad thing I can talk about is that Internet is paid for. Stayed for a Pitbull concert at roseland ballroom. Very convenient location. As a gold member got upgraded to a suite even though they were sold out! Great place would definitely stay again. The night shift front desk was great! Alex was extremely friendly and helpful! haven't stayed there before, had once a breakfast at \"norma's\" ,and been there couple of times fr the usual \"joint burger\" \\nrooms are small, shower was really small and with bad maintenance no sleepers , no ice cubes, etc... ,we were staying at the 16th floor and the construction noise was just terrible, we had to change to floor 20 to have a calm sleep, anyway won't be my first priority, and fr the record next time ill be looking for something outside of manhattan. We hadn't stayed LPM since about 8 yrs ago. Place was just as great. Staff very friendly and accomodating. Room super clean and still feel modern- the junior suite was perfect for a family of four. Location cant be beat - 2 blocks from Central Park and near subway stations. A great bargain at $300/night. The only drawback is if you get a warm day in winter, you cant adjust the thermostat and have cold air blow in. When the heat is on, that's it. Did not hear the jackhammers others talk about. Watch out for Norma's though. The service was not very good, the food was inedible, and everything was grossly overpriced. A third-rate diner would have been better than that place. Checked in 12/26. Jack hammering in the street, drilling DIRECTLY outside our window, and hammering and drilling in unit directly above! Unbelievable. No one when the reservation was made said anything about construction, nor did the front desk say anything at check-in. In addition, told no availability to upgrade (entitled as an SPG gold member if they have room), despite hearing the people next to us at check in being upgraded, without asking, to the class we were entitled to. It became appearant that no upgrade was forthcoming as we were redeeming points for the room. This is counterintuitive to me, you would think they would want to treat loyal customers well. With all the other fabulous hotel choices in the city...we won't stay here again. The staff is incredible. From the moment I pulled in front of the hotel the bell staff was taking the luggage and arranging to park the car. The front desk was excellent and accommodated a new request with a smile &amp; efficiency. Everyone always greets you with a hello &amp; a smile, holding elevator doors or eager to answer questions or help in every way. The rooms are fantastic, comfortable &amp; efficient. Very clean. The pool is always great, my daughter can swim in there for hours. So convenient to all mid town manhattan areas and being adjacent to Central Park is a huge plus. I've stayed here a number of times and will do it again.\\nHighly recommended!!!!!\\nWe were told that there would be construction when we made the reservation and we were actually given a choice to stay on the 56th side vs the construction site on 57th when we checked in. But, we wanted the park view and opted for the construction side. I would probably change that next time and take the 56th street side. But, it's NYC and there's lots of noise. It's not the hotel's fault that there's construction going on next door. My husband and I had a very nice stay accept for the construction work noise and delay in being able to attain our room in a reasonable time period. Location couldn't have been better and the staff is excellent. Rooms were adequate and service was very good. We arrived on 12/23 for 5 nights (using SPG points, 2 rooms, 36th floor, park view). When I called to book I was very specific to ask if there would be construction as we had been there in the summer and there was scaffolding and construction happening during that time. Also asked the concierge when calling 3 weeks earlier to make dinner reservations. She said no construction would be going on.\\nAwoke to jackhammers at 7:00AM on 26th, 27th and 28th. I'm telling you it's really loud!\\nAdditionally, when we were there in the summer one of the rooms had a faulty air-conditioner and the room wouldn't get cool. This time we had a room with so much heat blasting out that maintenence had to turn of the air system completely which left the room stuffy and still hot even with the window ajar.\\nUpon check out I requested to speak to a manager -- none available. The front desk person explained that the people I spoke to must not have realized we were staying past the 25th.\\nREALLY???!!!!!\\nNever staying here again! Recently stayed four nights and while there are certainly downsides, compared to other nearby hotels including the Essex House and Plaza it really good value. Yes, the noise is pretty unbearable but then again this is NYC and those at the Essex House and those who actually live nearby have to live with it. If you can get an upper floor larger room with a view of the park, it's pretty hard to beat unless you're willing to pay $1,000+ at the Essex House or Plaza. I've read many of the reviews and agree the outdated elevators that stop on every floor during peak mornings, annoying charge for wifi and not the most redecorated rooms, but the staff are as good as they get in NYC. People like Majda made our stay really great. Thank you. Having read the reviews about the next-door construction I had called about two weeks in advance of my stay to confirm a city-view and high floor (I was travelling with a 19 month old). I also requested an upgrade and was told that a note was made in my reservation but that I'd have to wait until check-in to see if anything was available (as typical in most hotel reservations). Was pleasantly pleased upon arrival that I was able to upgrade to a junior suite - perfect for my wife and child. Didn't hear a single construction noise (although we were usually up and about before 9:00am, which is when most of the construction started - hotel lobby level was VERY noisy with construction/jack-hammering - absolute torture for the staff who have to work through it every day). \\nAs others have pointed out, hvac didn't seem to work that well - couldn't get the room as cool as I'd like (I'm a 68-69 degree person) but wasn't that much of an issue as outside temps were in the mid 30s. \\nOverall very happy with this stay and will likely stay again - happens to be a perfect spot for what my wife and I like to do the most - shop! Sauna was closed for renovation (December 2011); Air-conditioning does not work in winter. I was asked to open the window which was impossible (too heavy) and unpleasant (construction noise outside). Stay did not meet the expectations I had for a hotel in this category I checked in this hotel 12/28/11 and will be here until 1/2/12. Overall, an average hotel with regular room rather small. The location is great. As a platinum member, I didn't get much except 500 points from them. I got a small room and our view is another high rise. The gym was closed until Dec 30. I tried to print a single page document and they required minimum credit card payment of $6. I would try other SPG hotels in the area next time I'm in NYC Arriving from the west coast, we checked in to the hotel after midnight, grabbed a late snack and turned in, only to wake up at 7am EST (4am PST) to the sound of jackhammers. I am a heavy sleeper and it still woke me up. In the lobby, you could feel the vibration, but there wasn't anything the hotel could do about the construction. \\nWe asked for another room that was further from the construction, and luckily there was a room available on a higher floor and away from the noise. The front desk was super helpful, the new room was an upgrade over the previous room, and the jackhammer noise was mostly muffled, at least enough to let us sleep to a more reasonable hour. Just now got home from our annual post-Mas stay, and although, to be fair, some critics here have some legit issues, all in all, we look forward to returning next year! \\nThe hvac system does seem somewhat unresponsive, but the good news is that the windows are operable, so the temperature is relatively easily mitigated by the outside air. The mini-bar fridge wasn't working in our jr. suite, so a seperate mini-fridge arrived to cool the libations brought from home (which worked better than stuffing them inbetween the mini-bar items anyway!) We had 2 rooms, one of which was affected by the [non-hotel] construction noise, and a small price adjustment was offered, and gratefully accepted.\\nOur upgrade to the tower park view twin for our sons and tower junior suite for us made this yet another great stay at LPM, and the Hotel's wonderful situation close to 5th Avenue &amp; Central Park, along with many great restaurants and conveniences, easily makes up for any relatively insigificant inconveniences afore mentioned. Staff is ever friendly and I still think the rooms are a refreshing change from similarly-priced traditional fare in the City.\\nGotta say that LPM once again earns our vote as best family-priced *wood property in NYC. \\n__________________ I must agree about the noise, not only in the lobby but through out the hotel. My daughter and I were given a room on the 7th floor, directley above the building work's After being woken at 6-30. All we needed to do was ask at the reception, and they mooved all our belongings up to 30th floor, by the time we got back from a busy day shopping.\\nThe staff are very helpfull. and the feather topper's and pillows are a very welcolme return to your room and bed at the end of the day. We've stayed with our family at Le Parker Meridien a few times now and each time has been great. We get adjoining rooms which works out well for our family of 5. The first time there we upgraded to a suite attached to a king room which was very spacious- almost more than we needed. The rooms are a great size and the bathrooms are nice as well. \\nMy kids love having the Burger Joint on site and we ate there each time. Great food- basic burgers and fries but can't beat the prices. The kids also loved the pool and it's nice that they have a lifeguard/pool attendent working at all times. \\nMy only complaint about the hotel is the conceirege staff. On each occasion we've asked for what I considered to be pretty basic suggestions- a family friendly breakfast spot, a good place to grab a sit down pizza/salad for lunch and a place to rent a DVD (they have DVD players in the room). Each of the three questions were answered so poorly---- for breakfast they sent us (in the pouring rain) to a total dive diner. The highchair they gave us was so disgusting I had to walk out the minute we got seated. We found a bagel place 3 blocks away that was much better. Also Sarabeths' on the park is excelllent (found it ourselves). For pizza, the only suggestion that conceirege had was again a total dive. We found Angelo's ourselves on 57th street (directly across from the back entrance of the hotel) which was perfect. Great pizza and salad. Crowded but perfect with kids. Finally, she had no advice on the DVD which was shocking considering there was a Duane Read on the corner with a Blockbuster self service machine (for $1!!!). For such a nice hotel, they really need a better informed conceirege staff. \\nThe hotel is walking distance to a lot- Central Park, Times Square, 5th Avenue. Great for sightseeing, shopping or just walking around. \\nOverall, we'll be back (and I'll be sure to do some internet research on restaurants before we go). Well first time in NY &amp; the Hotel was great. Good Rooms Good Facility &amp; Good Location.. Building going on next door is noisy during the day BUT we were always out &amp; about.. We would stay again.. Overall a disappointing stay here. We had read about the noise from the construction and came prepared to deal with it. The jack hammer noise in the lobby was amazingly loud. The desk told us the noise would stop between 5-5:30 and it did. Should have been okay - but not so much. There were garbage trucks compacting and hauling away the construction debris that literally occurred one night from 8:00 (when we arrived back to room) until around midnight when we finally passed out. This noise happened each night of our stay. \\nPros: Great location. The suite we stayed in was very spacious. The overall hotel has a modern austere feel. \\n Other drawbacks for us was to have to pay for wifi for the computers. My husband was told by the hotel company that parking was included in the rate he had booked but upon checkout was told we had to pay for it. We were also told we would be on a higher floor away from construction which did not happen. In short, bring earplugs if you decide to stay and be wary of rate details. I went with my wife and three kids on December 23rd. Checkin was simple and I was able to get into the room a little early. The room was spacious (for NYC standards), updated and very clean. The front desk staff was very pleasant and when I inquired about getting a city map they provided one at no charge. Please do not let others understate the construction noise! The noise in the beautiful lobby is deafening. We did not visit any of the hotel restaurants this year - but I imagine they would not be very pleasant. My family loves a parting burger at The Joint - not this year. We just wanted to leave. The lovely girl at the desk was apologetic, said we would be \"above it\" on the 31st floor but did note that there is a warning on the web site. We come here every year for a family holiday stay and call directly for reservations - no mention of the noise. I checked the web site - the reservation page has is a link to \"Photos - Hotel Information - Special Conditions.\" It should be in HUGE letters on the home page. \\nHere is the warning - \"Additionally, the foundation work of a nearby building is subjecting some rooms and the hotel's lobby level to daytime noise which can begin as early as 7 am.\"\\nOur rooms were on the 31st floor - what a view - and what a cacophony! We asked for rooms on the south side of the hotel to escape, but there were no connecting rooms available. A promised, the noise stopped at 5:30PM and began again at 7:00AM. Seven AM is NOT when I want to arise on a holiday. The hotel-provided earplugs were insufficient. \\nAs stated, we return annually. The rooms are not very luxurious - small and a little stark and modern for my taste, but clean and serviceable. My husband loves this hotel and is specially fond of the cartoons in the elevator. The location is perfect for a midtown home base. Restaurants, sights, shopping, park, and theaters are all walking distance. \\nPLEASE ask if the construction is still going on and request a room on the south side of the hotel. This is not typical city noise of traffic, horns, and ambulances. This is BANGING. This hotel was perfect for my family, 2 adults, three children. King bed with queen sofa and located near all the fun spots. Walk to Central Park, 5th Ave shops, Rockefeller Center, FAO Schwartz, and a subway stop on the corner. Great restaurant, Martha's for breakfast and great burger joint for lunch. Fun glass enclosed pool on top for kids. Will stay again on next trip. Great 4 night stay at Le Parker Meridien. Spent time at Knave, the on site site bar and had a great time. We were upgraded to a 36th floor room with a great view of Central Park. Easy walk to Central Park, 5th Ave. It would be nice if they had coffee in the room. There is a Starbucks across the street on 56th. Great hotel in a fabulous location (a few minutes walk to Central Park and 5th Avenue) and with friendly and efficient staff. We stayed from 12 to 19 December 2011 and there was noise from the building work next door, but, hey, this is a crowded city and it was not the hotel's fault. Would be happy to stay there again and hope that we will. Room was very nice with a large screen rotating TV. Good size room, esp for NYC. The restaurant downstairs (Norma's) was AWESOME, but really expensive for brunch. If you want to splurge yourself, especially for a couples weekend, this would do it for both breakfast and lunch, which is exactly what we did for two days. This was one of the better stays we've had in NYC and would go back there again in a heartbeat. I recently had a three week work stay at the Parker Meridien on West 56th Street and it was a top notch stay from the moment I walked through the doors until my checkout. From the hotel's elegance, style and cleanliness to the friendly and professional staff, it was an extremely positive experience and I would stay at the Parker again in a heartbeat. This was my 1st trip to New York and to have been lucky enough to have chosen this hotel to stay made the trip outstanding. The customer service was outstanding; Norma's was the best breakfast experience and the Burger Joint was awesome. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. The only suggestion I have for them is to fix the business center; I could not print my boarding pass. However, the staff took care of it for me. This hotel is well located but very basic. If you are looking for any luxury would not recommend.\\nThe construction noise is very loud and starts at seven a.m. and stops about 5:45 pm. I was not told of the construction when I booked and would not have stayed had I known. I asked to move rooms and was not accommodated. Was given $75 compensation after asking. I would not recommend this hotel without construction noise. My wife and I stayed here from the 15th-19th December and were greeted by the marvelous sound of a jackhammer!! Like other reviews have mentioned during the week (07:30ish-19:00) there’s building work going on next-door and it's extremely hard to hear people in the lobby. When we asked we were told that unfortunately this was beyond the hotels control and reassured the noise would only last between those hours (which turned out to be true). To be honest though it worked in our favour as it encourages you to get up early and explore NYC's sites!\\nWe were given a room on the 18th floor and were impressed by the size and space of it. Plenty of room to put your bags, a bathroom large enough to stand and move without knocking into something! and the bed provided one of the comfiest sleeps we've had in a hotel (could of been all the walking that we done?!)\\nThe hotels location is fantastic, with Central Park being 2 blocks north and the F line subway located right next to the hotel and the E line only 3 blocks south all of NYC main attractions are easy to reach, although walking is the best way to view the city (IMO).\\nThe hotels Burger Joint was busy the whole time we were there so thought it must be great and were a little disappointed when we did eventually get one as it tasted like a regular homemade burger (better then a fast food chains, but nothing out of this world).\\nSo overall our stay was very pleasant and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a reasonably priced and comfortable hotel in NYC. \\nOur only complain is that on check-out our bill stated that we had 2 sambuca shots from the lobby bar, but had not been in, nor drank there so someone had used our room number and name to purchase them, which is worrying, but it was resolved promptly. Great location beside Carnegie Hall. 10 min. walk to times square. Rooms are larger than what I'm used to in NY. Close to everything, Cental Park, Met. Museum,Broadway etc. If you like comedy, try Carolines on broadway...monday nights are for' up and comers'. $15 cover 2 drink minimum and 9 acts....Awesome Everything was perfect from Front Desk to room assistance. Location was great - close to central Park, My Suite was spacious and clean We love the hotel. The staff is always courteous and we love the proximity and the view of Central Park. We stayed on the 37th floor. This was our 5th year in a row and we'll be back next year to hit Broadway and Fifth Avenue, yet again!! Other than spotty elevator service, our stay at Le Parker Meridian Mid-town was more than satisfactory. Pleasant personnle, clean rooms, flexible maid service, and location is excellent. The Le Parker Meridien is one of my favorite hotels when I stay in NYC. Nice and clean - spacious rooms, especially the Junior Suites. Good restaurant and especially great burger place located in the main lobby (cash only). \\nAs a runner - only 2 blocks from the 7th Avenue entrance to Central Park with a Starbucks outside each entrance (56th &amp; 57th).\\nWarrning: The property next door is undergoing construction. The noise levels are beyond comforting from 7 AM to at least 7 PM. In the main lobby you can't hear the receptionist when checking in. I am told this will be the case until at least 3/2012. I have stayed at Le Parker Meridien several times before but the last two trips I made this month were spoiled by the roof top pool/gym being closed and the horrible jack-hammering noise from the building next door. To explain the severity of the noise, to the jack-hammering is not done by people on a jackhammer, but by Crane sized machines. I am sure the Le Park employees have lost a couple decibels of hearing because of that. Though the rooms I had the last two times were small, they were clean. They have this cool center console that they house the old Sony CRT TVs which are now much dated and need to replaced the with LCD TVs. At times I think the hotel management is more in love with the design of the console than providing current functionality it needs to provide. But overall, the rooms are beautiful, comfortable beds, with a staff takes a lot of pride in what they do. I was helped by this lady Annanida who was extremely helpful and professional. There is a not so fancysmanchy burger joint attached to the hotel, but being in the location there are plenty of good restaurants in walking distance - Nobu, Rue 57 to name a few. It is very close to Central park so if you are wanting to go for a morning run/walk it is the perfect place to get lost in. There are museums like the Metropolitan, MOMA, Guggenheim, Neue galleries in walking distance and ample shopping at Columbus circle and around 6th avenue. Best of all the location allows you to enjoy Manhattan the way it should be just far enough from the chain commercialized part of Time Square. Spent my ONE vacation day at the Meridien and wanted the day to end as fast as possible. In the winter the hotel shuts off their A/C system and only provides a heater. Their building is really old and hasn't been renovated in a long time so the heater would blast 80F at all times. I called the manager to help me out with this and the only thing they were able to offer was open windows (Its winter in NY, so freezing) or a plastic fan that makes noise just like the construction site next door. \\nSpent my night tossing and turning because of the noise outside (DT Manhattan cabbies honking) and after i closed the window it turned hot... Will never stay at the Meridien again and the lack of customer service from the hotel, not the starwood hotline guy, is making me rethink twice the next time I stay with a Starwood property again.. Just to let you know, I stay in hotels 4 nights a week for work and never had a bad experience like this anywhere else. Our tower room was small, but newly decorated and confortable. Should not have to pay for laptop connection given the price of the room. The staff was friendly and helpful, although some of the information provided by the concierge was outdated and inaccurate. Our first night's room, was small, old and uncomfortable, but the assistant manager agreed to credit 2000 points for the initial inconvenience. All in all we had a pleasant stay after the first night, and of course you can't beat the location. My husband and I, who are fans of Le Parker M and have stayed there before, were not exactly thrilled by the 7 am start of the construction at the lot next door, BUT we had a great customer experience that I wanted to share. We were only in NYC for a couple of\\ndays and running around on a tight schedule when we realized that we had an hour to return to the hotel for a much needed nap. The morning jackhammering had stopped, but the city was apparently doing some kind of work on the building that sounded like drilling right above our heads. After putting in our earplugs, to no avail, my husband called downstairs to ask about the noise. The front desk kindly offered to move us to another room, but that would have meant packing up, which would have taken up all of our nap time and defeated the purpose. Stephanie's well-thought-out solution? Letting us crash in an empty room on the other side of the hotel away from the noise. This is why we stay at the Le Parker Meridien NYC – great service – even under duress. Hopefully on our next visit the construction will be done. :-) I have stayed at other Meridien hotels where staff were more helpfull. I thought what was being charged for breakfast was a bit steep, more so because you were not sure to get a seat and had to wait in line behind people who had come in from the street.\\nThe room gave us a great view of central park but was not clean. Despite requesting this be addressed it never was. As we were there for a week we decided to clean the room ourselves. As a whole the hotel was not very well kept. It was dirty and looks tired. It is now trading on a name and given the hotels it is surrounded by that are comparative or cheaper it cannot be viewed as value for money. Stayed in the hotel for a about 5 days in Oct this year and booked at a pretty high room rate of more than $600. I had a problem with my flight schedule (who doesn't these days) and hence, contacted the hotel 24 hours before I arrived to informed them about my situation. Even though I was not cancelling my booking, they nevertheless charged me cancellation fees for 1 night, which is more than $600, which I thought was pretty unreasonable as I did contact them 24 hours before and I was going to stay anyways for another 4 nights. Anyway, reached the hotel and they were doing massive piling next door. Seriously the loud piling noise went on from morning till evening and it was terrible as I can't get decent rest in the pm. Even staying in the restaurants and lounge doesn't help and the best solution is to get away from the hotel. I tried to also print 2 pages of travel information but they did not have a proper business centre but only those automated ones that requires a minimal credit card charge of $6. The internet connection in the room was also terrible and it took a long while to download mails. Hence, for the price that I paid, I really feel ripped off, especially the additional room charge. I've been to many other hotels that offered better service and would be more understanding of traveller's dilemma. Decided at last minute to spend a weekend in the city for the holidays... We typically only stay at SPG properties and have stayed at a bunch of them all over the city. My wife and I like to stay at nice hotels, but are by no means travel snobs that nitpick over every little detail. Here are my thoughts:\\nThe Great:\\nLocation. We lived in the city for years, and still only live 15 minutes outside the city so we don't go 'sightseeing' but for those coming to the city for sightseeing and holidays, the location can't be beat. Right next to central park, walking distance to Rockefeller, Radio City, 5th avenue shopping, and an easy cab ride to any part of Manhattan.\\nStaff. The staff was great. Extremely friendly and professional without an ounce of pretentiousness. \\nThe Good:\\nThe lobby is nice as is the hotel bar. Beware of the crazy lines at 'the burger joint' (which I would avoid at all costs, but that is another review.)\\nThe Bad:\\nThe rooms. Regardless of whether you are paying or using points, the rooms just don't make the cut. Especially for a hotel that wants to categorize itself with the best in the city.\\nWe had a 'park view' room. Now, you can't complain about size, because it's NYC and rooms are small. It was an average sized room, bigger than the W's we have stayed at. It's the decor (or lack thereof) and the antiquity of the room that is unacceptable. From the old, non-flat screen television (even Holiday Inn's have flat screens these days) to the absolute lack of character in the room, it is one big disaster. Small conveniences like an ipod dock are non-existant. When you are paying as much as the hotel charges, you expect a certain standard, and it was not even close to being acceptable. I have read reviews that some of the rooms were modernized/upgraded, but certainly not the one we were staying in. I was even leary of walking around with my shoes off!\\nAnyway, if you don't care at all about the room and want a hotel that's pricey but offers a great location, particularly for the holidays, then the parker is for you. If you like having a nice, modern, comfortable room, then look elsewhere! My wife and I both travel a lot for work and probably each stay in hotels more than 40+ nights per year. We went to NYC for a romantic weekend without the kids and couldn't have been happier at the Le Parker Meridien. Lawrence at the reception desk took excellent care of us throughout the weekend and our view of Central Park was spectacular. We really couldn't have asked for more during our stay. Spent this past weekend at Le Parker Meridien, am definitely going to stay there again. The staff treatment from the front desk to the concierge was superb. The room was lovely and clean - we were in an updated room that lived up to the pictures. The location was just right for this visit - we could walk to the park, Broadway, 5th Avenue shopping, and lots of great restaurants in the area.\\nThe concierge was particularly helpful, managed several reservations for us and spent some time finding us the \"right\" restaurant on the one night we were a little late in trying to book.\\nWe did not eat at Norma's or The Burger Joint, but we did have great cocktails and nibbles in Knave. It seems as if Le Parker wants to be in the upper echelons of hotels, but there are some subtleties that stand out that just make the room seem average. This is our second trip in as many years during the holidays to NYC and there are better values out there.\\nFirst, I will say that the hotel staff were pleasant and accommodating. The doorman, bellman, front desk and concierge all were friendly and helpful when they were engaged for assistance. The concierge, in particular, when discussing reservations at a handful of places for my wife's birthday, helped us out. None of the restaurants we discussed at the concierge desk were available, but she did go and make a reservation at a similar location nearby asking only to cancel it if were not to our liking. I've seen concierges not take the initiative. \\nThe room, however, does need a bit of work. We had a top floor, Central Park suite, but it was dated. The wood paneling in the bathroom was watermarked, and the wallpaper had gaps that were very noticeable as it was white wall paper. It also had a stove, microwave and a fridge, but not a glass, fork, plate etc. to be found in the place. \\nThe electronics need a bit of an update. The bedroom television was an old tube TV that didn't have that great of a picture. In the main room, again this was a suite, the large flat panel tv required three remotes: one for the TV power and volume, one for the lodgenet box and yet another for the Sony surround system. The glow of the Samsung logo on the plasma did provide for a nice nightlight for our 3 year old sleeping in that room, though. \\nThere was also something going on with the heat. Neither of the thermostats seemed to actually control the temperature. We resorted to turning them off and just let whatever air was piping through the vent (clearly not turned off with the off switches) just flow. \\nWe did one breakfast at Norma's. The value just isn't there as there is no kids menu and even breakfast dishes started right around $20 and went up. A $24 waffle is quite a markup, but they had a nice citrus taste to them. \\nI will say, though, that the location can't be beat. It's within a few blocks of just about everything you can do during the holidays. For that alone, and a different choice in rooms, I would be back. We spent two nights and didn't have a single complaint. The room was not huge but a good size for the amount of time we spent in it. Very good service from check-in to check-out. Loved the rooms, for NYC they're spacious and were recently upgraded; the room controls were up to date and easy to operate. What was an unexpected surprise was the incredible water pressure! Not the sprinkle showers that make it hard to rinse but a torrent of water! The bed was low on the floor but incredibly comfortable and quiet! Great location as well, Starbucks right across the street and the F train was a stone’s throw away, three blocks from Central Park and a nice walking area to many shops and restaurants. Would come back here again! Amazing, amazing, amazing. For a new yor city hotel rooms are great size. Staff are thoughtful and informative. Norma's is as fab as ever - best break ie in town....ask for a high up room while the construction work is going on.....conciege and front desk were efficient and friendly without being robotic. Thus is our 5th time here on leisure, we will be back....thank you LPM. We were very happy with our stay. The location was absolutely amazing! The construction going on next door got a little noisy by 7am during the week but we were already up getting ready to enjoy the city and we expected a lot of noise in the city anyway so it didn't faze us but if you're planning on sleeping in, this may not be the place for you right now. Good space in the room, great location, friendly service...we will definitely stay again. Great hotel, fabulous service, amazing room and great location. Would definitely stay here again. This may usually be a good hotel to stay in but definately not at the moment!! We paid a lot of money to visit over a long weekend and were greeted by a hotel covered in scaffolding on the outside, and the noisiest building works you have ever heard. We had already been moved to the tower on the 29th floor and were wearing ear plugs when we were rudely awakened at 7.10 am on the Friday morning after Thanksgiving!! The floor in the foyer was actually vibrating and the noise was deafening! Even more disappointing was the complete lack of acknowledgment or advance warning about the noise/ works upon booking or in fact upon check-in. When we raised the issue with the front desk we received no help or apology, just an adament denial that this was anything to do with them...but as it directly affects their customers, a small gesture of compensation would surely have been appropriate in order to retain return customers - there was no reduction on price, or offer of a free breakfast, or even any coffee/tea making facilities? \\nThe leisure facilities and swimming pool were also closed for renovation (again no advance warning of this). Poor poor show! We may as well have been staying on the building site. The room was quite cramped but mainly due to the strange rotating bulky TV unit! Location was realtively good but that's about it I'm afraid. We found the staff to be most unhelpful. adequate but not worth the money, in my opinion. burger joint looked good, didn't try it Good visit. Nice rooms. Beautiful public spaces but UNBELIEVABLY crowded with holiday visitors. As large midtown hotel go... it was a positive experience. Don't know if I'd pay the prices they ask, but I used Starwood points and it was a great value for the number of points needed and also a fantastic stay. Nice, big, clean room with a great view of Central Park and great service from all employees. Would definitely stay here again. One of my favorite locations in NYC, right in the heart of everything. Hotel is no thrills modern and rooms are spacious and comfortable. Highly recommend it if staying in Midtown. We stayed at the Parker Meridian while attending the Architectural Digest Show. We arrived around 11am and the room was available right away. We were offered an upgrade to a suite for an extra $100, but did not except. We made our way to the 38th floor and opened the door to 3818 to be bought back in time approximately 10 years ago. The room had not changed in ten years. Which is not a bad thing, because the rooms are well maintained and modern design never goes out of style. The TV could be replaced to a flat screen though. The hotel was very busy which is nice to see, but we could not get into Norma's Restaurant for breakfast, it was a 1-1/2 hour wait. concierge excellent, often queues for reception, need to book breakfast at Norma's as soon as you arrive for whole stay or else ......no chance Location: in good corner of Manhattan convenient for business meetings in the city\\nAmbience: it feels like a good 4 stars hotel. A bit too busy with both tourists and businessmen flowing in. The lobby feels occasionally like part of a lobby of a train station.\\nReception: as it’s busy, there were queues to check in and check out I stayed there for a business trip for two nights over the weekend. The room was very nice - plenty of room, comfortable and very clean. The location was great - close to central park and within walking distance to 5th Avenue. Let me start by saying New York is not one of my favorite destinations (call me a Philistine, but I prefer suburbia to a metro area). Still, I would happily make my residence in the Big Apple if I could live in the Parker. From the art above the check-in desk, to the cartoons in the elevator, to the little blue lights outside the room, to the reading lamp next to the bed, all the little touches make a stay at the Parker exquisite! The junior suite I had at this hotel was fantastic. The room was spacious, especially for NYC, and very comfortable. There was also a really cool entertainment center set up that allowed me to swivel the TV around 180-degrees from the living room to the bedroom. \\nWhat I loved most about the hotel was the attentive staff. Shortly after arriving in my room, I started hearing a sound that chirped every 60 seconds. A quick search of the room proved that the sound was not coming from the room itself. Based on past experience in my own home, my guess was that the sound emanated from a smoke detector that had a low battery. I went out in the hall, and ascertained that the sound was coming from the room next door. I called the front desk, and within 10 minutes, a maintenance person was at my door asking about the noise. He went into the room next door and replaced the smoke detector battery right away. About an hour later, the chirping started again, although this time it WAS in my room (I guess my battery had an hour more juice in it than the one next door). I made another call down to the front desk, and just like the first time, the maintenance person appeared quickly and took care of the problem. After that, my stay was very smooth and I had a great night's sleep.\\nEven though the noise was annoying and required 2 calls down to the front desk, the issue was not really something the hotel could control for, and I was really impressed with the service I received when I reported the issue. Not only were they attentive to my needs once I was in the room, but the guy who checked me in was also very courteous and wrote his name down on my check-in papers so I could call him personally with any problems. I appreciate this level of personal service and I would definitely stay here again. This hotel really gives value in the city of New York. Well-sized rooms with comfy beds and good bathrooms. Location is tops. Plenty of breakfast spots nearby. This hotel is close to central park and have great views from their rooms. \\nWe stayed at floor 27 of 41 floors. Big windows so you get all of your view, big rooms and comortable beds. \\nGo all they way up to the top for an amazing view over central park! \\nThe service was good! I've never been disappointed with my stay at this hotel. The hotel is in a great location -- centrally located for whatever you're doing in the city and far enough away from the Times Square crowds. The rooms are always clean and service is always good. They also have a great gym.\\nWhile I do always love my stay at this hotel, I often times feel that it's a bit overpriced. And not that this makes a huge difference, but it would be nice for them to at least make the effort to upgrade the CRT TVs in the rooms with some sort of HDTV. EVERY other hotel that I've stayed at this year and last has HDTVs. Again, not a deal breaker, but seriously, the price of the rooms, I feel that this is the least they could do. My husband and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for a two nights recently. We had a nice price due to priceline. I was not overly impressed with this hotel though. Everything was nice, but there was no luxury in it. There were extra charges for using the gym, or the pool, a view was extra, staying in a higher level room was extra, etc. That being said, the room was clean and nice. The location was fantastic, we walked through Central Park each day we were there, were able to walk to both the Met and the Natural History Museum and found the subway very conveniently located as well. Just don't expect anything special from the accomodations... they are small and extremely basic. My husband and I visited Le Parker Meridien for 2 nights during St. Patrick's Day weekend. I got this hotel for $130/night through Priceline, an overall good deal in NYC. When I was assigned this hotel on Priceline, I was thrilled because we stayed here 2 years ago and loved the gorgeous indoor pool overlooking Central Park. I remembered that there was an additional charge to use the gym which was not ideal, but I was happy I could get a workout in the lovely pool. \\nWe arrived at the hotel on Friday night, and were checked into a king room on the 20th floor. It was very warm for March, and I remembered that during our previous stay (in May), we had some issues with the room being too warm. So when we got to our room, my husband called the concierge and asked if there was a way to make the room cooler. We were told there wasn't air conditioning available because it was too early in the year. They offered to bring up a fan and/or open a window. We did request the fan, which was delivered quickly and also kept the window open. Unfortunately, with the warm weather, the room just didn't stay cool and we weren't able to get good rest either night.\\nThe positive aspects of the room were the comfortable bed and that it was fairly large for a NYC hotel room. It was clean with modern decor. The bathroom was small, but that is typical in New York. The finishes in the bathroom were high end and looked nice, however, the tub was kind of bizarre as the bottom of the tub wasn't stuck to the floor. It bubbled up when I stepped on it. Also, the sink faucet was placed too far back on the counter so that the water barely made it into the sink. This is a small criticism that I probably only noticed because I design and remodel houses for a living, but clearly the hole for the faucet was drilled in the incorrect location on the counter. My overall thought on the room is that it would've been very comfortable and enjoyable if it wasn't so unpleasantly hot.\\nOur biggest disappointment came when we changed into our swimsuits and went up to the pool, excited for a swim, only to be told that the hotel now charges $15 per person/day to use it. We didn't have too much time to swim and therefore didn't think the fee was worth it, but also didn't want to pay just because we expected it to be free based on our previous visit. It just didn't seem right that there was a charge for both the gym and the pool. I would expect some free facilities for use at such a high end hotel. We originally planned to hang out at the pool a little before we left on Sunday, but without a free pool or gym to use, we decided to change our train home to an earlier time as it didn't seem worth it to spend the extra hours at the hotel.\\nOverall, I recognize that we still got a good price through Priceline for an upscale hotel on a busy weekend in New York. And our negative experience is partly due to our high expectations based on our last visit. I do like the hotel's location as it is a bit outside the insanity of Times Square. But I certainly wouldn't pay the regular rates or even use my hotel points to stay here in the future because of the room temperature issues and extra fees for the pool and gym. Our recent stay at the hotel was disappointing. The room was small and there was no view and the temperature was quite warm and could not be adjusted.\\nMost unpleasant was the new, unadvertised charge for the use of the roof-top pool. While the aquatic director was lovely and accomodating, the charge for a brief swim was not. \\nWe will not return to this hotel. Dear trip goer,\\nI found this hotel to have a polite but unhelpful staff that at times could be condescending. I found the rest of the hotel beautiful and in a great location near central park. For the amount of money it cost for a room, you just expect great service and the service and it was below average. I would suggest another hotel in a similar location if I could do it again. Lovely property, excellent lounge and great service staff. Weekday construction is over-the-top noisy, but ends at 5PM and doesn't happen on weekends, so bearable. Once the work is completed, this is a fabulous property. Will definitely return again. Got a great deal on this 4 star hotel in a perfect location in midtown south. Room was perfect, beds, linens, hvac so comfortable we slept until 11 next day. Checked out late but no trouble. Would defi itely stay here again. Love the espresso bar nave in lobby. Hotels that really care about your comfort and have authentic good karma are winning my business and starwood is one of those chains. The location is great ...especially if you like Central Park as I do. Close to two great subway stops to get uptown/downtown - east and west sides of NYC! Rooms were nice size, bright and the bedding and amenities excellent. Staff was helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable about the area. The fitness center is spectacular! Everything one would want for a great workout! I go to NYC several times each month and I've been looking for a consistently good hotel - location especially - and I found it in Le Parker Meridien! I stayed at this hotel in the first week of April 2012 and the overall experience was excellent.\\nThe rooms are large for New York (at least the deluxe room). The location is great, within a few minutes of many popular New York locations like Central Park, Times Square and Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Time Warner Center, Rockefeller Center etc.\\nAlthough the rooms weren't ready at 3 pm when we reached, the front office went out of their way to get them ready in fifteen minutes. One consistent thing that stands out is that the staff of all departments is very friendly and efficient. Housekeeping is excellent, bell desk service is outstanding, the doormen are very helpful - on our departure, one of them (at his own initiative) managed to find us an SUV taxi so that all our bags fitted into one vehicle. This general high standard of service makes up for any shortfalls in any of the other services, not that there were many. Room service did take very long and some part of the order was often either not correctly filled or not completely filled, but upon being informed of the error, they made up in the shortest time.\\nBeware though that the hotel has two very popular F&amp;B outlets - Norma's, which claims to serve New York's best breakfast and Burger Joint, which serves great burgers and both are so popular that there are actually queues in the lobby to get in. Effectively, as a hotel guest, you are deprived of restaurants in the hotel. It will not matter because this is New York and the area around the hotel has more eating places than anyone can need!\\nOne sore point (unfortunately becoming common for many hotels, particularly in New York) is that wifi has to be paid PER DEVICE and not per room! With our having six devices in our group, this would have have worked out to over $100 per day! In the age of i-phones and i-pads, this policy is going to prove to be even more unacceptable to guests in the future. Wifi is now a necessity and not a luxury and charging unreasonably for it, is counterproductive. In my opinion, this would be the single largest reason, for me at least (and many others, I would think), to consider other options instead.\\nOne small comment about the swivelling television units in the rooms - these are grotesque (the designer must have been in the middle of a nightmare) and take away far too much space, but was informed that these are soon being replaced with wall mounted TVs. The other inconvenience is the lack of a coffee maker in the room, particularly when there is a $5 room delivery charge for even one cup of coffee, in addition to the charge for the coffee.\\nOverall, I think I would probably stay here again after prenegotiating wifi rates. This hotel is at a strategical location. You can visit Manhattan very easily. Staff is customer oriented, always smily. The rooms are bigs and the view is magic ! Le Parker Meridien is in a great location, closet to Central Park and 5th Avenue shopping. Subway is close as well. This location provides access to sites downtown, but in a location that is a bit nicer due to it's proximity. The new pool on the rooftop is also a great amenity!\\nBreakfast at Norma's is a must. One of the best things about staying here.\\nThe suite was relatively nice, but could use a bit of an update. Stay on a high floor for unbelievable views! best place I have stayed in New York. Great service. Definitely can recommend. Everything was lovely and we enjoyed all the attention to detail. The room was very comfortable and had everything we could think of. Quiet and comfortable for my twin 16 year old boys and for me. We had enough room in the room with a sleeper sofa in one room and a big bed in the bedroom. Bathroom was very nice. The staff is very quick to help out with pleasure. The rooms are cozy and the lobby area has a understated sophistication. I especially like the \"uniforms\" of the staff - stylish yet somewhat casual. It makes them very approachable.\\nthe bed is okay for someone with back problems- perhaps some comfort tops would be great! otherwise, they're comfortable. We stayed at Le Parker for two full weeks and didn't have the slightest complaint. We were located on the 29th floor (no park view) and we didn't have any issues with either outside noise or room temperature (it is true that it takes some time for the air conditioning to really kick in). \\nRoom was spacious and actually visually better than how it seamed from the pictures. Cleaning was amazing. Very efficient and discreet, we were never bothered, not even once in 14 days! \\nLocation is amazing, just look at the map and you will easily understand that. TV sets are old but I know that they currently replace them. WiFi is not free (only at the lobby and the bar) but that's the case in every NYC hotel that I checked with (I really don't get why this happens, free wifi is a plus for someone to choose a hotel nowadays)\\nLast but not least, sleep quality was very high, bed and pillows were perfect! We stayed at the Parker Meridien over Thanksgiving weekend. Hotel was in a great location - just a few blocks from 5th Avenue, FAO Schwartz, Central Park, etc. Room was large - we stayed in a junior suite with a king bed and a queen sofa, which worked out well with 2 kids. The room was clean, with a large desk and table, and large bathroom. The Burger Joint was great - great hamburgers, no frills. Only complaint was concierge - seemed uninterested in engaging as you walked up to them. Front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Some night time noise due to construction, but it is NYC - don't expect it to be quiet. Pool had amazing views - was well run. Nice touches for kids - gave them great NYC coloring book at check in. Overall great stay - we will be back. Love the staff, Cluade the bell man is the best, check in is kind and considerate, love to jog in Central Park just one block away. 5th Ave shopping is around the corner, cant beat the location! I loved the room, but I like a little more lighting...too dark 4 me! The decor very modern (Hence the low lighting!) Stayed in Jr Suite, nice size. Needed a bathrm fan (4people!), could not adjust your own room temp (had to call) Shower leaked onto floor....but other than those few things, great friendly staff, beautiful lobby, restaurant &amp; bar and enclosed roof top pool very cool, great location, close to shopping and time square (walking distance just a few blocks) Would stay again, although try to get a room up high for a better view, we starred into an office building (which they called a \"city view\" 12th floor (need to get above 20 or so I guess.) Best coffee I ever had at Norma's. Pricey but worth it! Each time we are in New York , we stay at the New York Palace. When we made our reservations, Palace didn't have a room for our first night so we made a reservation at the Le Parker Meridien for one night.\\nWe have been to Le Parker Meridian many times to eat breakfast at Norma's which we love but never stayed at the hotel.\\nRoom was very small, small bathroom, dark and depressing room, furniture was old, door lock was broken, looked like somebody tried to get in to room so it was damaged.\\nRoom had an old style bulky TV that I haven't seen since long time. Bed was the most uncompartable bed I have ever slept in, I had a back pain rest of the trip.\\nHotel has a nice lobby area, nice bar and restaurant but nothing else. If you are looking for a 5 star quality hotel, do not stay here . We had a regular room, I am not sure there are better quality rooms in this hotel but I can not immagine. \\nWe will never go back to this hotel to stay but we will definately go to Norma's for breakfast. We stayed at the Parker Meriden over the Thanksgiving Holiday and loved it. My family had a junior suite as well as a King Standard room. The rooms were spotless, well appointed and comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful with our requests, suggestions for stores and restaurants and care of our two dogs who stayed with us. The \"Burger Joint\" is fabulous and such a \"funky\" place right off a gorgeous marble lobby. The burgers are so delicious and the service is fast and reliable. Norma's for breakfast was terrific and the Knave was a great lounge area for drinks at night. We would go back in a heartbeat. The location of the hotel is perfect-everything is so close by-theaters, Radio City Music -Russian Tea Room and Jack's Steak house on East 56th was within walking distance and delicious! We didn't get to use the pool but it looked beautiful and would have been good for our 14 year old if we had the time to use it. My husband and I stayed at the Parker Meridien for 8 days for Thanksgiving in NYC this year. We loved the location (56th Street, between 6th and 7th Ave). It's close to Central Park, close to 5th Avenue, and if you like walking, you can get anywhere in midtown. There is also a subway station right at the corner (6th Ave and 56th St) for the F train, and another station on 7th Ave for the N, Q and R trains. It's very easy to get anywhere in NYC. (Just ask the concierge for a subway map so you'll have it with you.)\\nThe hotel itself is very nice, and all the people we dealt with (front desk, doormen, bellmen, concierge) were friendly, polite and professional. We stayed in a suite facing the 56th Street side of the building on a higher floor, so we were not inconvenienced by the construction noise that others here have mentioned in their reviews. I think if you face the 57th Street side, that is where you will have the noise. (By the way, the construction is not at the hotel, it is in an adjacent building, so there is nothing the hotel can do about the start time in the AM, etc.). If you are an early riser and you're out of the room all day, you won't have an issue. According to the hotel, the construction will be finished in a few weeks. If you are concerned, I would suggest calling to speak withg a manager and requesting the 56th Street side, and on a higher floor. \\nAs for the room itself, the bed was very comfortable (firm), the decor was sort of \"Mad Men\" style, mid-century modern. The bathroom was user friendly and we had plenty of room for our toiletries. If you are accustomed to staying at hotels like the Peninsula, Four Seasons, or Ritz Cartlon, then you will not be satisfied as this is not that sort of hotel. I would say it is more along the lines of a nice Hilon or Sheraton, with a little more of a trendy twist, which is just fine for me.\\nRegarding the restaurants in the hotel, there is a groovy place off the lobby called \"The Hamburger Joint\" that attracts a local crowd that lines up to get in. There's also a restaurant called Norma's in the lobby that is just for breakfast/lunch, which is popular with locals. It's on the pricey side, for a special occasion breakfast or brunch outing.\\nAs with most NY hotels, you will be charged a daily fee for high speed internet access. I think it was $16.28 per 24 hour period. Also, if you need to use their business center computers/printers, there is no charge to print boarding passes but if you need to print other documents or use the computer for other things, there is a per minute charge. \\nWe didn't park a car there. I would definitely not recommend getting a rental car in NYC. You don't really need it and it costs a fortune to park. Just walk, take the train, bus or hail a cab, if necessary. \\nLast but not least, housekeeping was very good and very efficient. We never had to worry about coming back at the end of the day and finding the room not made up. It was always done and the room was always very well cleaned. We were here for a 2 night stay during Thanksgiving week. It was a pleasant surprise.\\nI was worried about the noise from the construction that's been mentioned in other reviews, but since we weren't sleeping in late, the noise that started around 7:30AM didn't turn out to be an issue (we had our own alarm clocks, a.k.a. the kids). We were on a higher floor facing north, so that may also have helped. I think if we were getting over jet lag and wanted to sleep in, it could have been an issue.\\nThe location was the best part of the hotel. We spent a lot of time in Central Park, which is just a block or so north. Nearby we easily walked to the Apple store, FAO Schwartz, and Rockefeller Center. The hotel is basically next door to Carnegie Hall, across the street from City Center, and a couple of blocks away from MOMA. There's also several subway stops within a block or two that got us where we needed to go.\\nThe room itself was also decent. A little larger than I expected for a New York hotel and up to date. The TV wasn't a modern flat panel TV, but we didn't come to watch TV anyway. The beds were comfortable. The main downside is that the room was a little warm, and despite lowering the thermostat, it didn't get cooler, but it was OK.\\nParking was expensive at $52/day, but that seems to be about in line with NYC parking.\\nOverall, it was a great stay and I would definitely consider making this my first choice for our next vacation to New York City. The location of the hotel was very nice. Across from the New York Theater Club, and just down the block from Carnegie Hall. The F train is a half a block away, as are the N, Q and R on the other side. The rest are easily walkable, and Times Square is a quick walk, as well. The room was large, and the bed was OK.\\nThat said, they nickel and dime you for everything. This may be one of the few hotels left that charge you for a disposable razor or toothpaste if you forget to bring yours. They charge for access to the hotel gym (not during our trip because most of the gym was shut down for renovations. Hence, no machines, sauna or jacuzzi), and they charge you $2 for water at the gym. The hotel cafe was outrageous for breakfast. We went once: she had a french toast and a cup of coffee, and I had banana pancakes and a glass of orange juice. Total price for that breakfast was $73.\\nThey provide a complimentary umbrella in the room, but no robes.\\nThe construction noise, as mentioned in many other reviews, starts every weekday at 7 am with some kind of pounding (not jackhammers, but much louder and which shakes the room). Virtually impossible to sleep through, even on the 20th floor, so don't plan on seeing any shows while you're in New York, or you will be massively sleep deprived.\\nThe concierge tried to steer us away from some wonderful, reasonably priced restaurants, and kept trying to get us to go to high-priced ones (He tried to send us to a dim sum place that had horrible Yelp reviews and a roughly $40-per-person average price).\\nIn all, the hotel is adequate, but nobody goes above and beyond to be helpful. And with an average per-night price close to $600, you really should expect more than adequate. Having a concert at Carnegie Hall, we found the location of the Parker Meridien very convenient. The staff was quite helpful and service was excellent. The room was small but well appointed, and the shower water pressure was the best I have seen in a long time. The room lacked bathrobes and hangers, but this was corrected quickly at our request. We learnt that the A/C system was only heat, so after a difficult first night, we had the hotel staff unlock our window so that we could bring the temperature down quickly for sleeping (they also gave us a fan), as we are used to do. Overall, I would come back to this hotel for its location and the good service. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, so I assume I always get a bit of TLC when I visit startwood properties- Not the case with the Parker NYC. This was my second time at this property and my last. First of all we enter reception and the guy at the front desk has a horrible cold. He is pale, coughing and sneezing. Just what I want to see on the first day of vacation, not to mention I have a child with me to be exposed to this. No upgrade available Im told. Ask for manager, he doesnt have a cold but proceeds to lie to me that they are booked at 100%. I take this standard room since its late stuff 3 of us in tiny quarters. Go to be at 2am, to be awaken at 7am by huge jackhammers and noises. NO ONE decided, even with my startwood status to tell me huge construction was going on at the hotel. We asked to be moved to a quieter room at 7am. At which point they moved me to a suite. I thought there were no more suites left? Liars! Still heard noise , rude manager told me she would not refund me. Called Starwood, got moved to W LEXINGTON, much better experience. W Lexington, front desk staff awesome, did everything they could to help me out.\\nPARKER NEW YORK sucks! Noisy, rude staff, liars, small rooms- dont go there. W Lexington rocks! I have stayed at the LPM a number of times over the last several years as a part of a large group (over 100 people).\\nThe hotel rooms are good for NYC as well as the location. On this occasion, I feel the hotel management and staff was deliberately and systematically deceptive regarding the monumental noise issue next door. I first became aware of it very abruptly at 7:00AM the first morning after arriving on a very late flight. To call it 'jackhammers' doesn't even begin to describe the Armageddon-like thumping that shook the room (taking shelter in the bathroom didn't help one iota). In stunned anger (I am a very heavy sleeper, btw), I called the front desk, and they were neither fazed nor apologetic. The person at the desk said the noise was from next door so it wasn't their fault - and they repeated that line again after I asked insistently WHY was I not informed this when I checked in??? They obviously knew of the issue - it had been written about on TripAdvisor for several months (I found out while searching the internet at Starbucks - their internet didn't work at all either, btw) and the lobby was literally shaking when I exited that morning. There was a note in the guest rooms apologizing for a completely different matter - some maintenance on their brickwork I believe - and that would start at 9:00AM I think - but they made NO mention of the far larger noise issue that eclipsed any noise from brick work, hiding behind that they were probably not legally responsible for the horrible construction mayhem next door. Not cool.\\n I found out after the fact that the hotel management had informed our management of the construction mayhem the SAME morning we arrived that there was a noise issue. We had this arranged for many months prior. This was an obvious effort to leave out crucial, and highly pertinent information as to the quality of the stay to a large repeat customer group. I have absolutely no patience for this and I will be advising my group (as many of us will) to take our business elsewhere in the future. The decision makers' mode of handling this, and lack of timely information, was highly deceptive and inexcusable, and the leadership in charge of deciding to handle this huge issue in this manner should be ashamed of themselves. \\nAnd to top it off, usually, when a hotel has a construction or major issue affecting the fundamental quality of life for the guests, there are some sort of promotional rates to compensate guests for the trouble, as well as to encourage guests to still come. This time around, the rate was by far the highest we had paid - the group rate was around $400 per night, and online it was around $500 per night. $400-500 per night to be surprised in the morning with a jackhammer in your ear....nice (the jackhammering goes pretty much straight from 7AM to 3PM with a lunch break). Weekends, not a problem. Weekdays, be prepared for the jack-hammer alarm promptly at 7:00 AM. Fortunately, we were out pretty early so it wasn't too bad, but I would suggest trying out the south (city view) rooms to see if they are any quieter. They will likely be cheaper anyway. Great service from the front desk and quick response to emails before we arrived asking if we could have connecting rooms since we were travelling with small kids (which they accomodated). Also got an extra rollaway bed for no charge. Location is perfect!\\nNorma's was good (all breakfast) but service there was a little lacking and slow. I would recommend Sarabeth's about a block away on Central Park South. Burger Joint does a good job of feeling like a greasy, hole-in-the-wall, which is exactly what you want when eating a great burger.\\nFor Starwood regulars, I would put the room quality between Sheraton and Westin on average. Comparable to a little bit older Westin maybe- comfortable, functional, nothing flashy. I was traveling with my dog and searched to find a good pet-friendly hotel. I thought it would be good to stay near central park. Because I had my dog with me, I was particularly keen to get an early check in, so i checked the availability the night before, and called more than once the morning of my arrival. Everyone said \"no problem\". When I arrived at 1:00 I was told absolutely no early check ins, leaving me with two hours to kill with my dog in Manhattan. \\nThe pool was closed but no one bothered to inform me during booking or check in that the amenity would not be available - once I asked, I was told it would be opening \"tomorrow\". when I returned to my room at 5:45 after a long rainy day in the city, guess, what, there had been no maid service. \\nThe room was too hot, and there is a big sign on the thermostat saying \"call us\" and when you call they send a tech to your room (not exactly private) to open a window. \\nThe staff never opened a door, never asked if i needed a cab, never offered any suggestions. I have stayed at many hotels in New York, from the Benjamin to the W and every one of them was a better experience. \\nSave your money there are many better options, on and off the park. Did not originally plan to stay here, but glad we made the change. Service at the desk was awesome. We were offered a very low cost upgrade to a junior suite as a traditional room would not be available for a few hours and we wanted to get settled. The room was large and clean with a pullout queen sofa so no air mattress needed for our son. Very modern look and feel. Location was great. Just between the Park and Times Square area without the feel of crowds (NYC was crazy everywhere else with early holiday shoppers). So easy.... will stay again on next trip to NYC.... great location.especially for theater. comfortable rooms. great beds. very good staff Great staff, great room, great location. I always choose Le Parker Meridien when I am in the City. Great location and friendly staff. The property next door was under construction so the noise early morning and at cocktail hour was deafening A great midtown base for a long weekend in Manhattan. Comfortable rooms, attentive front desk service and a cool lobby bar in the long corridor to 57th. \\nThe current construction next door makes for appalling weekday noise so I would check before hand if you are staying during the week We stayed at the hotel for 4 days in October and fortunately stayed over a weekend so that wew were not bothered by the very loud noise from the construction every day of our stay. I really liked the hotel and the room that were very large for NYC. The location was also excellent. \\nDispite all the excellent things about the hotel we will most likely choose another hotel for our next stay in NYC since there unfortunately is a lot of construction going on adjacent to the hotel on 57th street and since we had a room on 16th floor facing the construction it was impossible to sleep after 7 am on weekdays. We had no warning of the construction before we arrived at the hotel so we were not prepared to be woken up by veryb loud drilling and banging Monday morning.\\nI feel very sorry for the people working at the hotel at the moment since the noise from the construction was so loud that it was very difficult to talk to each other in the lobby area of the hotel. We were bothered by the noise in our room but at least we could just leave the hotel very fast when the noise started in the morning. The staff were stuck there all day. \\nAs I liked the hotel itself I would stay here again but only when all of the construction has finished. Let me preface my commencements saying I generally love the Le Meridien brand. I wish I had had a positive experience here because as much as I come to NYC, I would love to have loved this hotel. \\nI won't get into many details, but suffice to say I woke up w/ bites and told the hotel about it, they denied and claimed they had inspected and found nothing (same as other reviewers have indicated). I am not one of these bug freaks, clean freak yes, but not a bug freak. I received bites, my wife, a few inches away, did not, take it for what its worth.\\nnotes:\\n-great location (two blocks from park)\\n-very good sized room, upgraded to Jr. Suite (looking back wish we hadn't been)\\n-outdated decor/furnishings in room, terrible TV\\n-functional bathroom/shower\\n-nice lobby bar\\n-maybe property was new and fresh in 80's, but no longer\\nWith all the places in NYC, why stay here?\\n- There is a warning on the hotel website (you have to dig for it, its not on main page or anything, i think i finally found it under hotel conditions) and I discovered from the various reviews about the construction- after my travel agent had already booked the stay, so I wasn't quite sure what we were getting into. Yes it is loud, especially in the hotel lobby, but wasn't necessarily a bad thing for us- we were there to explore the city and had planned to be up early everyday anyway, so the 7:30am construction didn't ruin our stay. When we checked in we expressed our concerns and they advised we would be placed in a room as high as possible to lessen the noise (we arrived in the city very early and well before check-in). When we got our room later in the day we were on the 32nd floor with a fantastic view of central park. I felt the room was a good size, the bed was comfortable and very important, no bedbugs! It was starting to show it's age and yes it could use some updating and maintenance - the bathroom mirror was chipped, the shower leaked all over the bathroom, the bathroom ceiling had a lot of mold on it and the shower pressure was extreme, almost too much in my opinion.\\nThe hotel staff were great on every interaction, from getting cabs to providing places for breakfast, tips and directions, very polite and friendly, they certainly helped to make us feel comfortable and happy.\\nThe burger joint is a must try, but be aware of the long wait. We waited approx.30 mins on a Wednesday night at 10:30 and the place was packed, so nice to have the option to go back to the room to eat.\\nThe hotel bar is also great, prices are steep, but worth it! My husband had the best martinis of his life, and they were huge so worth the price.\\nNo major complaints, great location, especially for our first visit to NY, I did have higher expectations for the amount we were paying but overall was not disappointed. I've stayed at the Parker Meridian before and had a great time, but was there this week and there was a ton of construction going on. Really really loud banging at 7 am on a Friday morning. Was up on the 19th floor and woke us up. I could barely hear the associate as I checked in. I was told construction was from 7 in the morning until about 5:30 in the evenings. I'd stay away for a while. Great location and the staff were very helpful. There was construction going on next door and under the floors that at times was overwhelming. They start banging at 7:00AM so if you’re a late sleeper Mon-Fri you might want to rethink until construction is done. No work on the weekend I was there. I would love to stay there again! For a number of years, I have been regularely coming back to this expensive but well located NYC Hotel. The quality and friendliness of the staff always made me come back despite the high price (&gt; $ 650 a night). This time a terribly vibrating and loud construction noise accompanied us during our stay: it was difficult withoud loud screaming to order a drink at the hotel bar.\\nWe felt very sorry for the hotel staff. It is ofcourse a sign of terrible management quality not to warn guests of the construction work and related noise. \\nAlso note that the swimming pool is also closed. Here again NO warning. \\nNeedless to say that we have deleted the Parker Meridien from our NYC hotel list. I stayed here every October for past consecutie four years. It was overall very good enough for business travelers. You can walk or jog around the central park. Kind reception, cosy lobby and nice bar \"knive\" where tasty cocktails and side dishes like fried olive and nuts. Norma's, a famouse brunch restaurant is excellent. I love morning smoothy. Booking is necessary esp weekend brunch. Great hotel, terrific late night bar, however the current construction is a real problem. Demand a south facing room over 56th St. The construction is on 57th. This was my third time at the Parker Meridien. It is as good or better than the other, more expensive hotels at which I have stayed - Essex House, Regency, Plaza. The rooms are good sized and the staff is very good. Tom and Jerry on the elevator = awesome. I had some Starwood points and used them to stay here last week for 5 nights. When I checked in there was a constant sound as if the subway were running through the lobby. I was told that there was construction next door and it would be like this daily. Because the noise was constant it actually disappeared after the first day; even though I could hear it in my room I slept through the first two hours each morning. The room and the employees at the entire hotel were excellent and I was very happy with my accommodations and the attention I received. I would definitely stay here again. We're always satisfied when we stay at this very European flavored hotel. Our latest stay was in October. Lots of foreign travelers, beautiful rooms, great location, oh, and a fabulous cheeseburger joint in the lobby. Sometimes some great deals too. Our room was on the 21st floor this time and although it had some flaws (weak AC and a sagging bathroom door that wouldn't shut without slamming) overall, we were very happy with our stay. Yes there is construction, yes the lobby is loud and no its not their fault. They were very helpful on the construction problem. I could not hear a thing in my room. The lobby was LOUD, but it was over by 530 pm. \\nGreat location for work and play. Easy to get around. The staff couldnt have been more helpful. We had our 8 year old and they met every kid request easily and quickly. Loved the cartoons in the elevator.\\nMy only grip was the anciet TV in he rooms. Its just strange. Its a very modern, hip hotel and then a TV from 1987? I didnt get it.\\nOther than that...and the daytime lobby noise...a very good hotel. Really enjoy the Parker meridien hotel - Rooms clean and spacious, amazing service throughout. Hotel is well located in Midtown. The burger place in the lobby is very good, would reccomend the hotel to all. Stayed for 8 days at Le Parker Meridien and had a thoroughly pleasant stay. Construction work going on next door but couldn't hear any noise in our room. Room quite spacious for NY standards and certainly very comfortable. Brilliant location close to park, shopping and short stroll to Times Square. Norma's great for breakfast but would advise to make a reservation. Consierge also very helpful and friendly. We just got back from spending 4 nights at the Le Parker Meridien and were pleased with the hotel. \\nThe pros -- the hotel is in a perfect location. Easy access to Broadway, Central Park, 5th Avenue and the subways. Our room was on the 26th floor and looked out over Central Park. The windows in our room opened so we enjoyed opening them at night and listening to the sounds of the city. The rooms were very comfortable -- nothing fancy but functional. The bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms were adequate. The shower pressure was outstanding! However what really stood out to me about this hotel was the staff. Everyone we dealt with was friendly, efficient, competent and helpful. The only meal we had at the hotel was at the Burger Joint. I recommend getting there early. On the weekends the line is long.\\nThe cons -- as the others noted, the construction. We arrived on the weekend so the first 2 days were quiet however the construction started early Monday morning. It wasn't really bothersome in our room but it was noticeable in the lobby area. We weren't at the hotel much during the day so it really wasn't an issue for us. The TV in our room was a good 10 years old and didn't work all that great -- some channels were snowy. We didn't go to NYC to watch TV or we would have contacted maintenance about it. I don't know if it was our room or the general reception.\\nOverall this hotel is excellent and I would stay again -- even with the construction going on. My husband surprised me with a long-weekend in NYC and we stayed at Le Parker Meridien. This place was great. We had a beautiful view of Central Park. The bathroom was a little small, but we were able to navigate just fine. Very modern type of hotel. I would definitely stay there again! We stayed at the Parker Meridien years ago and we were looking forward to returning this week. We are so disappointed. While the hotel can't control the noise from nearby construction, they can do something about the attitude of the staff here. Check-in desk was staffed by a rude and cold woman. We have three nights left here and if moving wasnt such a hassle, we would be long gone. Our first night here, the bed linens were dirty and had to be changed. The second day, housekeeping left trash in the room, there is no turn down service, no replacement of towels, they charge for internet service ( REALLY???? lesser quality hotels throw that in for free). While drying my hair, the hair dryer quit working and when we called for a replacement, the man came up and wanted to start reinstalling a new one, while i was in the bathroom with wet hair trying to get ready for an event! No hand held dryer in the hotel? The tv doesnt work well and is so outdated, the rooms are tired. What this hotel has going for it is the location, location, location. And Normas is great for breakfast. But if you want to feel any sense of attention from hotel staff, stay away. Let me start by saying that I stayed at this hotel free with Starwood Points. I make mention of that because I might review the hotel a little differently if I paid $400.00 per night for three nights. As it stood, I paid nothing.\\nThe hotel lobby is interesting- when you walk in, the check in attendants are at a small desk with MacBooks as their checkin computers. This sets the stage for the unique sleek look of the entire hotel. The feel of the hotel would be, I guess, art deco? Not sure. We checked in without wait on a Friday night around 8pm.\\nOur room was just fine, and decent size by New York standards. The bed was quite comfortable, and the bathroom, while quite small, was just fine. Two people cannot get ready at the same time in the bathroom, but I will say that the bathroom actually had a bathtub instead of just a small shower. That's unique for NYC. \\nThe TV is a tube TV, which honestly, didn't matter to me. I was in the room to sleep, and get ready. I watched a little TV when I first woke up in the morning, and at night to put me to sleep. So, while it may be unfortunate that this $400.00 hotel doesn't have flat screens in each room, that wasn't a big deal to me.\\nNeither then was the closet space that did not have a door. It is simply a curtain you pull back. Who cares? Seriously. \\nThere was a desk with a chair, and the drawers for storage were in the wallks beside of the desk. Unique, different, and it worked fine for me. \\nBurger Joint downstairs is incredibly crowded, incredibly great, and a must-visit. Cash only; just bring the burgers back to your room since you'll likely not find anyplace to sit. \\nWe did not visit the other two restaurants or bar there, but I've heard good things about both.\\nNow, for the real reason this hotel gets four stars from me. You have access from the hotel to both 56th and 57th streets. You are 2 blocks from Broadway, 6 blocks from Times Square area, 4 blocks from spectacular shopping, half a block from two subway lines, have countless restaurants within two blocks, pharmacies, grocery stores nearby, and the Park is two blocks away. Simply put, this location is great for Midtown visits. You are in the middle of it all.\\nI've read some complaints about jackhammering, and the hotel can do nothing about this. We didn't hear it at all until Monday morning at 7am. It was quite annoying, and checkout proved it was loudest in the lobby. But I mean, call ahead and ask them if they are still doing construction. It's my understanding that it's during the week and in the morning. Plan accordingly.\\nOh, and this hotel has a pool on the roof that we didn't use, but we did go see for the view. Best view you can get of Central Park for free (and legally) I would bet. \\nAll in all, I loved my stay here. I may be biased, since I collect Starwood Points with my American Express. I bet that I make this a regular place to visit, since the location is so perfect. Definitely recommended. Just the opposite experience of Joan F. Top notch management team at this hotel. Everyone at all levels were genuine in their desire to be helpful which these days is a rare experience. There was construction noise on our park side room and management did a great job of moving us to a nicer room on a higher floor with no noise. They knew how to solve the problem and did.\\nFront desk very helpful, maids helpful, pool staff and health club staff knowledgeable and helpful, ditto for Norma's and the lounge. Usually stay at the Westin or W. The service here is top notch. I stayed at the Meridien in Manhattan for one night and have mixed feelings about it. The positive is definitely the location....excellent for walking to all points of midtown, including broadway, central park, 5th Avenue, etc. The main negative was the room, which needed updating. The bathroom door stuck and the walls had some small stains on it. The room itself was ok (comfortable beds) but the TV was old. Honestly I would have expected the room to be nicer, given the reputation of the Meridien. The other negative was the concierge to whom I spoke about restaurant recommendations. He had an attitude and seemed annoyed that I was inquiring. The following day I spoke with a different person who was much more helpful. I'm used to travelling solo, but went to NYC with my nephew and niece (both under 11) for four days. The Parker Meridien accommodations (junior suite) were comfortable and grown-up (relatively roomy bathroom with sleek fixtures, desk and ergonomic chair, 2 couches (1 pull-out), good-sized living area and sleeping area). At the same time, the hotel was completely kid-friendly. The in-house burger joint served quick, tasty burgers and fries, and the cafe/restaurant was a less casual sit-down option that still could handle children. All staff were friendly and helpful. Room service orders were right on the money every time. Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons on the monitors in the elevators provided a good distraction at the end of long sight-seeing days. The rooftop pool is a neat concept, but it's very small and not much room for kids to play -- shape expectations accordingly. Dean &amp; DeLuca and Starbucks are directly across 56th, and there's easy access to multiple subway lines. One of the Central Park playgrounds is about 6 blocks away (the Park's about 3 blks from the hotel, and the playground is about 3 blks into the Park). Central Park Zoo is an easy walk, as well. There is construction next door that makes the lobby a noisy place to be, but up in our room, we could not hear it at all. All in all, our hotel experience was excellent, and I'll be staying there again, with or without kids in tow. My wife and I used to live in NYC. We have been in San Francisco for many years, but our hearts have never left NYC. We take a week every year to go back and re energize in NY. It is almost a pilgrimage - so you can imagine my concern when we walked in and heard the loudest racket- pounding, jack hammering, clanging I have ever heard inside a hotel - ever. \\nThere was major foundation work going on next door. I felt so sorry for the employees. I listened to how they handled the many guests who all had major concerns about staying and I must say they were completely empathetic to the situation and committed to making each guest comfortable in their decision to stay. Or help them find another Starwood property to go to. Without blowing smoke at them I might add. \\nThe woman who checked us in was able to get us on a high floor far away from the racket, and I must say our week there was one of the quietest I have ever experienced in NY. Either living there for 6 years, or visiting for business for over 25 years.\\nThe level of genuine concern and helpfulness started at check in, continued through to the maids, the doormen, the concierge, the maintenance staff, the bartender and waitresses, and everyone we ran into at this property.\\nWe usually try to stay at one of the many lovely boutique hotels in NY, but I think the days of sleeping around are over. We've found out 'go to' hotel in the city from now on.\\nGreat job to the team at Le Meridien! Our room had a peak view of Central Park, which was nice. In the morning, we got up and took a stroll through the park... can't beat the location. The room was clean and modern, we had a wonderful stay. The pros of this hotel--\\n1. Location (a few blocks from Central Park and off 6th Av.)\\n2. Relatively modern/updated (flat screens, well-lit bathrooms)\\n3. Quiet (on 33rd floor)\\n4. Quick service (at check in, check out, and room service)\\n5. Good room service food (healthy and less healthy options)\\nThe cons -- \\n1. dated ventilation system (but Engineering will open the window)\\n2. slow and too few elevators (making for a wait to depart)\\n3. Construction occurs during day - 7 - 3. Very very loud.\\nIn short, if the price is good compared to others, the location is great and it's clean. Gym looks good, although didn't get a chance to use it (there is a small fee). All in all, nothing unique to recommend it above other hotels in the area, like Sofitel or Muse. But no reason to avoid it either. I think a hotel has a responsibility to let guests know that there is major construction going on upon check in. Waking up to jack hammering and not really knowing what is going is pretty disturbing. I was meeting a colleague for a breakfast only to realize that the lobby was so noisy there was no way we could even hear ourselves speak. We went to Starbucks across the street. I know that construction is not always avoidable but it is inexcusable not to be told this upon check in, or there could have been a note in the room. On other points this hotel is mediocre at best and for the price you can definitely do better in NYC. I have stayed at this hotel on multiple occasions in the last 7 years. I like this hotel because of the location - it is just 2 blocks from Central Park, is close to almost all subway lines and you get Starwood Points but the hotel is now a bit dated and the rooms need refurtbishment. **A word of caution** there is currently construction going on next door to the hotel and the pounding starts promptly at 730AM. I was on the 22nd floor and could still hear it. I had friends eating at Normas and they said that the noise was unbearable, making it impossibly to have a conversation. I asked the front desk and they said the pounding is expected to continue until the end of October 2011.\\nPros:\\n- Great location - near Central Park and almost all subway lines\\n- Rooms are reasonably large for NY standards (even the most basic rooms)\\n- Check-in and check-out are reasonably fast\\n- Norma's (the restaurant downstairs) has amazing breakfast/brunch\\nCons:\\n- The bathrooms are small and if you don't get a suite, the bathrooms have that gross thin fabric shower curtain that gets smelly over time\\n- One sink only in the standard rooms (I can't remember if there are 2 in the suites or not).\\n- This hotel needs refurbishment. The rooms still have CRT TV monitors!!\\n- This hotel is not very international travel friendly - no built in adaptor plugs into the sockets\\n- The broadband sucks. They use a 3rd party provider (which bills you separately) and I kept getting bumped off and having to call the 1-800 number to re-set the IP address\\n- I think it's really tacky and unprofessional the way the guys at the entrance of the hotel who help you to get taxis and help with your luggage are constantly counting their tips in front of guests\\nTips:\\n- Try and get upgraded to a suite on one of the higher floors\\n- With the construction going on now, you definitely want to be on a higher floor Major contruction project next door causing a ridiculous amount of noise!! I cannot believe the hotel can possibly remain occupied with this going on. A little warning to potential guests would have been nice, but instead we were abruptly awakened at 7:00am every weekday to an unbearable jack-hammer-like noise that literally didn't stop until 5:00 pm. The noise is heard throughout the hotel (lobby, gym, meeting rooms, restaurant) is so loud that it is nearly impossible to have a conversation, let alone try to sleep through it. This could possibly explain the somewhat frazzled attitude of the entire hotel staff. The noise, by far, was what compelled me to write a hotel review, but there were so many things to dislike about this hotel!! To avoid an overly lengthy description I'll try to be brief:\\n• Unwelcoming arrival -- front desk attendant seemed flustered and struggled for quite a while to find the room with 2 beds that we had reserved, finally did.\\n• Opened the half bottle of wine in the minibar only to find that there were no wine glasses in our room, (although there were shot glasses in the bathroom???). We were told that there would be a delivery fee if we wanted wine glasses. Nevermind.\\n• Went to \"The Burger Joint\" in the hotel... there were no tables available so we asked if we could take the burger to a quiet table at the hotel bar so we could enjoy it with a cocktail. We were told we could not bring \"outside food\" with us, even though it is from inside the hotel.\\n• Forgot my razor so I called housekeeping to bring one up... (pretty standard for a hotel to provide a disposable razor if requested). Nope, razors are $10.00 at the 4-star Parker Meridian. Opted to buy a pack at the market down the street.\\n• No coffee pot in room or complementary coffee in the lobby. Small cup could be purchased for $5.00. Thankfully Starbucks is right accross the street.\\n• Front desk attendant gave me an outdated fitness class schedule, so I woke up early to get to a class that wasn't scheduled for another hour later. Also hotel guests have to pay a daily fee of $10.00 to use the facility.\\n• Trying to relax a little in my room on the 8th floor only to glance over and find a man on scaffolding right outside my window!! Apparently there is yet another project going on at the hotel (also extremely loud) and you should keep your window coverings completely closed if you want to assure your privacy.\\n• Saturday morning fuel truck causes the entire hotel to permeate with the smell of gas. Front desk attendant acts like this is totally normal.\\n• Requested turndown service on sleeper sofa... Never happened until we got back late and called twice. Would have done it myself but didn't have linens or pillows for the sofabed.\\n• Received bill at checkout... multiple minibar charges were listed, although we never opened the minibar after the first day for the wine.\\nThe Upside:\\n• Complimentary shoe shine\\n• Rooms were clean and comfortable (although revolving tv cabinet was huge and took up too much space in the room).\\n• Because of the loud noise from construction, we were moved to a different room higher up and on the other side of the building. You still knew when it was 7:00am because you could hear the construction begin but the sound could be muffled with a pillow over your head.\\n• All incorrect minibar charges were taken off our bill without question.\\nBecause this was not an inexpensive hotel, I was so disappointed. I have no idea how it could have a 4-star rating given the lack of ammenities and extra fees. For these reasons, and especially because of the contruction noise, I would highly recommend staying elsewhere. Good Location, main entrance is off 56th Street not 57th as is their address.\\nMust have a hamburger from the \"burger joint behind the curtain\" in the lobby. It is the best you will get, but have your order ready when you get to the front of the line as they as fast pasted and not tolerant of out of towners. The whole hotel has attitude, but it is New York. Great hotel if you are into tennis as a lot of players for the US open stay here from end Augsust to mid September, so get your booking in early if travelling at that time. While we checked in, I witnessed three people complaining at the front desk about three separate problems with different rooms. That made us wary, of course, but then we had our own problems. Immediately we were told that there was major construction going on, but they couldn't move us from the side of the building with construction. The construction was running from 7 am to 5 pm every day. Luckily our room was on Floor 10, but in the lobby and the lower floors it was throbbing and deafening. You literally had to raise your voice to speak in the lobby. Later that evening, we learned that there was no air-conditioning in the entire hotel, even though it was the first week in October, and 75 degrees outside. And the employees couldn't care less about our complaint. Excellent hotel. Great location and very friendly and helpful staff. Loved the penthouse pool and good facilities. One down was that my wife found the bed uncomfortable and a bit 'lumpy'. A must is The Burger Joint, tucked behind the curtain to the right of reception. Choose your time as it is tiny and gets busy very quickly. Overall would heartily recommend and would return without hesitation. Very bad check in experience, broken lock on the door, no robes in the room. Under construction. But the most annoying thing was very unapologetic response from General Manager and staff. Very arrogant and made it seem like it was my fault. Definite down-turn in quality. Very good value for a 4 star hotel in a great location near Central Park, Carnegie Hall, Lincoln center and the shops at Columbus circle. Check in was very quick and we were immediately taken to our room on the 21st floor. Room size was very generous for NYC standards - plenty of space, large windows with city view. The bathroom was a bit on the small side, but very functional. Room was very quiet and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. Other amenities that are available, though we didn't use them: a penthouse level pool and Gravity, the hotel's gym with all sorts of work out classes and equipment (quite a perk). \\nI have to say, everytime I passed a staff member in the hallway or elevator, they ALWAYS had a smile and a pleasant greeting. And the concierge managed to score us 3 last minute seats at Atlantic Grill for dinner before the opera....after calling all 10+ restaurants in the area of Lincoln Center. The staff really do make quite an effort to be helpful and courteous.\\nThe only negative of our stay was actually what I had thought would be a positive: Norma's. I made reservations for 11:15 on a Sunday morning. However, apparently \"reservations\" is just to get a better spot in line. We were not seated for 30 minutes...and only then because we parked ourselves in front of the hostess until she found us a table. There was no apology, or even a complementary orange juice! There were many others in the same situation as our party. The breakfast itself was good....but we ate under the stares of many customers crowded at the hostess station, presumably past their \"reservation\" time as well. \\nOverall, the hotel was great and I would definetly stay again....but would skip Normas. do NOT go there until the adjacent construction is complete. Jack hammers started at 7am...on the 16th floor...ripples in the bedside glass...Bose noise canceling headsets and earplugs no help. No warning upon checkin it was happening. No apology from hotel staff.\\nBAD SERVICE - BAD stay I usually stay closer to Times Square, but really enjoyed the proximity to Central Park &amp; shopping. We actually found ourselves taking fewer cab rides this trip since it was so easy to walk to Rockefeller Center as well as Times Square and the theater district. At the end of the evening we really enjoyed the very cozy hotel bar. \\nThe rooms were large by NYC standards, and the beds are awesome. \\nThe construction noise next door is deafening, however, and it seems Sunday is the only \"noise-free\" day. Good choice if you are going to be out of the hotel all day, but stay elsewhere if you hope to work from your room. My 7 girlfriends and I stayed at the Parker Meridien for 4 nights mid September, 2011. It was a fabulous experience and we were treated like royalty. I needed a doctor for an eye problem and they immediately put me in touch with a dr. within walking distance from the hotel who took me right away. He was fabulous. I even spoke to him on a Sunday. The concierge people were wonderful and booked restaurants and bus trips for us. There was even a limousine parked outside the hotel which we used several times....it was easier and cheaper than two taxis. \\nThe rooms were clean with very comfortable mattresses and pillows and thick towels. Flat screen tv's too. We even had one hour of free wi-fi in the lobby. We had breakfast at Norma's and it was very reasonable because we shared the servings which are very large.\\nThere is also a very unusual hamburger restaurant behind a curtain in the lobby. The Burger Joint.....$7 hamburgers which are delicious, one of my friends had three hamburgers on three different days! You have to wait on line and there is no table service but it is an experience and fun!\\nThe location is perfect...near the MOMA, Central Park, where we walked every morning, shopping, restaurants and a short walk to Times Square. There is a Starbucks directly across the street which we made use of every day. \\nThe indoor pool on the top floor is amazing with wonderful views of the city. There are lounge chairs around the outside deck for relaxing. \\nWe were warmly welcomed and Anandi worked very hard to get us rooms near each other and on the floors that we wanted. \\nIt is a wonderful lobby to people watch and many people from the United Nations were staying at our hotel because there were meetings at the UN that week.\\nI would not stay anywhere else in Manhattan! Great location, Construction next door was HORRIBLE (luckily, I just happen to being earplugs so we could sleep). It would have been nice to get a better room rate for that inconvenience :0) We were able to check in early after an overnight flight (but were charged $250 extra) The Omni Berkshire let us check in early for no charge since the room was available, the Omni was A LOT more fun and friendly with my kids also. Hotel was not nearly as \"family friendly\" as they advertise, my children seemed to be an annoyance more than welcomed... that was disappointing. Housekeeping broke my laptop, I think they must have vacuumed over the top of the case or something??? \\nThe room was a nice size, especially for NYC. Bed was super comfy, shower was huge, although not having a tub was a bummer with a 3 year old. Overall, nice hotel, not as \"superior\" as expected though. This was my first time at the Parker and I no longer will be staying at the Paramount or the Hilton on 6th Ave or the Sheraton. Everything was A1 wonderful: the beds were the most comfortable of all NYC hotels I've stayed in (and I've stayed in a lot), the down pillows, the friendly staff, the immediate responses to housekeeping requests, the classy bar with the great music and generous drinks, even the fast umbrella provided by the concierge when we noticed the sudden rain... I could go on but I have to get back to work. Thank you for making my 4 days in NYC more of a delight than a normal business trip.. The location is good as other reviewers have noted, but the rooms are small and travel with small children here I thought was challenging, there is no floor room for them to spread out. However, it was walking distance to FAO Schwartz &amp; Central Park, so that helped. While we were there considerable construction was taking place next store and the sound of the jack hammer under the lobby was head-ache inducing, certainly loud enough to make you want to avoid eating in any of the hotel restaurants, so ask about that. Food for our dog (1 lb of ground beef) was $18, then with room service &amp; automatic tip &amp; delivery charge, it ended up being $30! So while it was nice to have the option of ordering dog food, it was the most expensive ground beef I have ever bought! The pool is nice, great views, well maintained. If you are traveling with children, do not ask the concierge for help, the 2 restaurants she directed us (we asked for kid friendly places to eat) did not have kids menus and one of them (Bistro Milano) served our toddlers milk in wine glasses! Plus there wasn't another kid around in either restaurant. Maybe New Yorkers don't dine out with their children?? Great location, nice staff,Large rooms by NYC standards- They even had our room ready fro check in at 9:30 AM!!!!! Wow.- Great breakfasts in Norma's - ( bu a tad on the expensive side) This hotel was chosen for location and because I was redeeming my Starwood points. The hotel is clean, modern, good facilities such as the gym/spa and espresso bar. It's a shame there is no free wifi in the hotel rooms, and sometimes we had to wait a while for the elevators, but the rooms and service were excellent! Staff were friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us! Would definitely recommend!! Many thanks - definitely \"Parker perfect\"! If you want location without extortionate prices then Le Parker is a reasonable choice. Its a bit more expensive than places such as The Manhattan but the step up in quality is very visible. Walking distance to 5th Avenue and Times Square and my room overlooked Central Park. Room was spacious for NYC and I did not notice any of the cleanliness issues that I had previously read in some of the reviews on TA. There is a car park exactly next door and a Starbucks across the road. I would definitely stay again whether it be for business or leisure. I recently stayed at the Le Parker Meridian in NYC in Sept of ‘11. \\n1. My flight was a red eye and arrived early in the morning, around 7AM. I arrived with my wife and my mother inlaw. All of us were exhausted from a long flight. When we got there, they first told us our room would not be ready until at least noon or 1PM! That’s fine, if they would allow us to go into another room to at least rest and freshen up, but they would not do that. They had room available, they could of let us sleep and have housekeeping come and clean up after we left, but they refused. \\n2. I arrived with 3 guests. But the room I booked, had two beds, but 2 small beds, according to the hotel staff (Who were very rude btw). They offered me to upgrade to a single king with a roll away. Originally they wanted $50/night for that roll away cot. They said they could upgrade me to a room with a King and a Pull out Queen for $75/night. I said, \"If you are willing to waive the $50 for the roll away, and want to charge $75 for the pull out, why not call it even at $25/night and we got a deal.\" They said, NOPE. And they would only upgrade me for the roll away bed. (all this was AFTER #1). \\n3. The room itself was horrible. The bed was from 1982. With disgusting old covers. I felt like we were staying in a Days Inn. Not a Starwood Category 5!! The TV was also from 1980 and took up half the room. \\nOverall, the Hotel management and guest staff were rude and the room itself was disgusting. I have pictures if you like. I paid with my Starwood Points and I would very much like my points back. In fact, we were so disgusted with this hotel that we checked out a day early and checked into a HILTON so we would not have to sleep uncomfortably anymore. I paid cash for the Hilton. Just to let you know how dissatisfied I was. That I would be willing to give up a free night in your hotel rather than stay. It's my 30th review, and I'm running out of ways to describe a room. \\nI've now stayed in over five hotels in the city over the past two years - four of which were SPG properties. The Westin is still my favorite but I did enjoy my stay here (minus the jackhammering next door). \\nMy room was a junior suite with three closets, a minibar, a comfy couch and large workstation in the \"living room\" and a very large bed. Annoyances: the bathroom was too small and the water was too hot out of the sink tap. \\nThe bed - fell asleep instantly. Couch - fell asleep there too. Towels - nice and soft. But my absolute favorite - the Peter Thomas Roth bath items. I generally hate hotel soaps and shampoos (including the Westin's). They dry my hair and skin out but this brand was very good that I took them home with me.\\nThe lobby is a bit too nosy for me, but very formal looking. I couldn't figure out the decor (silent movies or cartoons in the elevators) or the staffs' uniforms. I wanted to try Norma's but it was too noisy with that construction next door. \\nOh the \"business center\" is nothing more than two computers and a nice printer. \\nSo why do I prefer the Westin Times Square? The lobby is more spacious and nicer. The bed is just slighly more comfortable but the location is just better. We stayed for 10 days in a standard room on 27th level. The rooms are well equiped, the bathrooms seem to be older. The reception and concierge team is very friendly and helped any time. In the lobby, there is a smell of kitchen and the prices for breakfast are too expensive. But overall, we would choose Le Parker Meridien again. What our travel agency in Switzerland would have expected, is that they are informed about the noise of construction and that the roof pool was closed. This was sad, as we would have loved to use the swimming pool whilst being there - temperatures would have allowed it. Having stayed at various other Starwood hotels in the past 5 years (most of the W's. St Regis, Westin Times Square etc.), I thought it was time to try something different - so we went for the Le Parker Meridien using the 5-for-4 points deal.\\nAll in all, the hotel is actually pretty good. Supposedly famous burger joint on the ground floor was fun (and ridiculously busy), internet was good, rooms were fine, didn't eat in the restaurant, bar area was also fine. Location is excellent for walking, tube and bus journeys. Top-floor pool was cold, so was therefore of limited use on an otherwise freezing cold December week.\\nI'm going to give the hotel 4* of feedback as it was very good but not excellent. The bad news - Meridien doesn't make any mention (during reservation or on web site) that there is full-on construction next door (2 excavators breaking concrete ... has to be experienced to believe)\\nThe good news - I arrived early &amp; Andrea graciously checked me in and got me a better (bigger room)\\nMore bad news - What would prompt my first TripAdvisor review? Security guy rudely telling me I can't eat my pumpkin bread in the lobby while drinking my coffee \"this area is for drinks only\" ... $610.00 for 1 night w/ this racket &amp; this is what you get from the staff?? Amazing!! I stayed here in mid October for 4 days and felt the hotel was overpriced for the quality of the rooms. At some point the hotel was modernized but now it feels beat and in need of upgrading. There is construction right outside of the hotel that makes it impossible to enjoy the lobby and restaurant. There is a very large gym in the basement that feels dark and dingy. The burger joint which gets pretty good reviews is overpriced with food on par with an In and Out Burger but at twice the price. To sum it up I would stay at the W or if I am splurging the St. Regis. The hotel is in a great location, just a few blocks from Saks and great shopping on Fifth but it's not a great hotel. Stayed here weekend of 9/23 and was surprised at how accessible everything was, despite my many trip to NY, this mid town location was ideal! Steps away from the subways, Starbucks across the street, 24 hr. deli's for a late night snack - a block away. Walk to Central Park - 2-4 blocks, shopping, dining (Russian Tea Room), Lounges (Lavo, Dream Hotel, Hudson) all were within a few block radius and very safe to walk around day or night.\\nThe staff was friendly and attentive to our needs, the rooms are small, but then again its NY, unless you're in a suite, its always going to be a small room, however; the bath amenities make up for it. \\nDefinitely sign up to be an SPG member, it has its perks like early check in, upgrade and late check out's. Look for Emilie at the front desk who will take care of all your special requests, or see Michael - Concierge who will point you in the right direction for dining and a night out on the town. My wife and I had an awful stay at the Parker Meridien for a mixed family/business trip. Another reviewer commented that nothing has changed in a year and a half. For us, nothing has changed in two and a half years. Following a rocky stay in early 2009, I gave the hotel a long hiatus to get things sorted out before giving them their much requested second chance. I even called the General Manager’s office early in the week of our arrival, just to remind the executive staff that we were giving the hotel a second chance and while we didn’t need any special favors, we wanted a trouble-free stay. We had anything but and the hotel will not be getting a third chance.\\nOur arrival was delayed more than four hours out of LA by American Airlines, so we arrived at 11:30 pm in pouring rain. (I called ahead to let the hotel know of our delay so that they would know to expect us very late.) There was no doorman to meet the taxi, so we hauled our own luggage out of the taxi and into the hotel, getting nicely soaked in the process. There was no recognition that I was a repeat guest or SPG Gold by the front desk staff practicing its ennui - it's not really necessary but it is appreciated to be recognized as someone who helps keep the surly staff employed. \\nUp in the room things were no better. The wireless Internet service still does not work after all this time and frankly I don’t care if the hotel signed a bad long-term service contract – that’s their problem and not mine when I am being charged $16 a day. The desk chair was broken, there was no turndown service for the first two of our four nights, ice was not provided even when there was turndown, dirty dishes were not removed from the room, we were not provided a morning newspaper despite the SPG Gold status (the lie I was told was that the papers were at the elevator which they were not and never were, on any floor), and on the two occasions that I needed to contact the concierge I was put on hold once for six minutes and the second time for almost five minutes and the attitude was one of utter annoyance (something that I had also encountered back in 2009).\\nHaving had enough of this twice in a row over a period of more than two years, I attempted to contact the General Manager in the middle of our stay, only to have his secretary challenge me on why I thought the staff was indifferent. No apology – just a challenge. When I told her that I had just explained the problems to her and did not think she should challenge me, she told me to “Have a nice day” and hung up on me. That prompted me to call the hotel operator and ask her to connect me to SPG Corporate Services. The operator told me “We don’t provide that as part of our service” and she too hung up on me. Obviously, someone is running his hotel teaching his staff that they can misbehave without fear of retribution. So, I called SPG Elite Corporate Services myself and opened a formal complaint right then and there. The GM was never available thereafter to speak with me for the duration of our stay and once we left the hotel I am sure we were completely forgotten by him.\\nSeveral days later, I did receive an email from a guest relations manager asking for yet another chance and offering me an upgrade. The hotel has had its two chances and since this never was about being upgraded to a junior suite, I don’t know why I would need a larger room in which not to have functioning Internet, turndown and ice, all served up with indifference. \\nFor a hotel that puts on such false airs, it is curious that it thinks it amusing that its “Do Not Disturb” sign is emblazoned in New Yorkese: “FUHGETTABOUDIT”. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do with this hotel. I originally booked into a room with 1 bed, but a friend decided to join me. The staff was very helpful on moving me to a room with 2 beds to make our stay more comfortable. Unlike other hotels in NYC, the room was what I would consider a full/regular size.\\nLocation is ideal just a few blocks from Central Park and the staff was very friendly and helpful. There are several things about this hotel that are quite good...the location is fantastic, the pool area has a stellar view, the lobby area is very attractive, the rooms are clean, and the doormen are fabulous. Other than these things the hotel doesn't really have much going for it other than it is moderately priced by New York standards.\\nMy husband and I stayed at the hotel mainly for the location and because I am an SPG member with an advanced standing and Starwoods is currently running a triple points promotion. I booked a junior suite and requested a high floor, a park view, a quiet room, and a member level upgrade. Generally Starwood hotels guarantee an automatic upgrade and try to accommodate members' requests. Not here. We received a room in the same category as booked on a middle floor with no view right next to the ice machine and elevator. The hotel was not at all booked to capacity so there must have been some other reason for the room allocation.\\nThe main decor of the rooms was down at heel Ikea (meaning wood veneer over particle board) which is not holding up well. The color scheme was primarily tan, brown and burnt orange. The green couch was hard and angular without accent pillows to make it more comfortable. The desk area was spacious. The platform bed had a futon mattress only and was hard and very uncomfortable. There was a small closet in the living room and a larger one in the bedroom both with curtains instead of doors. There was a built-in armoire in the bedroom as well.\\nThere is construction work going on next door and the hotel, especially the lobby, becomes quite noisy beginning in the early morning but that's no fault of the hotel's. The drain in the bathroom sink did not drain properly and this was eventually corrected, but when it was, the tub no longer drained.\\nWould we stay there again? I'm not sure; it would depend upon what else was available. The location and price were good but I don't think I could spend another night in one of their beds. I ended up sleeping on the couch instead. Just got back from my first New York trip and loved every minute of it. We had a room on the 28th floor overlooking 56th street and the construction noise did not bother us at all but the noise in the lobby and bar was extremely loud on most occasions that I was passing through and I commend the staff for being cheerful and polite while working under those conditions.\\nThe location was perfect, two subway stations nearby and walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, and Rockefeller Centre etc. as well as many places nearby to dine.\\nWe were two women sharing a twin room and space was not an issue at all though to be honest we were generally only in the room to sleep which we did very well as the beds were really comfortable which was a huge bonus after being out and about for 12 hours some days.\\nThe views from the pool area are spectacular but unfortunately the three times we went up there hoping to go outside to take photos we were told the deck was closed and we weren’t allowed out.\\nOverall the Hotel was perfectly adequate for our needs of a comfortable place to sleep, have a shower and drop off the shopping in between experiencing the most of New York that we could. I lucked out and got Le Parker Meridien through Priceline for two nights...so i actually didn't know the specific hotel until i purchased it ...needless to say the price of this upscale midtown manhattan hotel was really more than reasonable and i was very happy with the way things turned out....The room was just fine...maybe a little smaller than those in less congested areas but -- come on -- have you ever been to hotels in Europe or Japan (talk about small rooms !)... There was construction going in a building adjacent to the lobby so it was very noisy there...and i was a little concerned... but 35 floors has a remarkable effect on dampening out any such noises.... it was quiet as could be...not even street noise....\\nNeedless to say the hotel is in a wonderful location...a gazzilion restaurants around...(but don't forget to check out either the Carnegie or Stage Delis nearby for overwhelmingly large and delicious sandwiches, desserts, etc...put your diet on hold !)....The bathroom was clean and perhaps renovations had been done recently but i found everything just fine (large flat screen tv's ,etc....). Kinda wished that they had a coffee maker in the room -- but no such luck..... The maid service was excellent ... and the view from 35 stories up was lovely.... I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for two nights this fall. The room was cramped - which is normal for NYC, so I guess I cant blame them for that, but the bathroom was a bit tired - needed a new grout job in the tub, the shower head was terrible, shooting in all directions and no pressure - same story with the sink taps - literally no hot water pressure.\\nAlso, considering the hype and price of Le Parker Meridien, the room was a bit '2003'... the TV was still a huge tube tv, and the decor was just slightly out of date.\\nHowever, the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.\\nOh, and dont forget your toothpaste - the hotel was more than happy to bring up some toothpaste, but with a $10 charge to my room.... no thanks... \\nR We moved from the Hilton Times Square to the Meridien on 56/57 with its superior location near the park and good dinning spots. We had a junior suite which gave us extra room and the rate was less than the prior nights. Our stay was on a weekend so we did not experience the construction noise others have mentioned despite the fact we were on the 7th floor. My only complaint was I had made a reservation for breakfast at Norma's but when we arrive at the appointed time it was clear we would have a long wait. We elected not to wait as their are a number of good breakfast places with two blocks of the hotel. I can't say I like the room decor but I do like the location and having the extra sitting area was a real plus. Stayed for three nights in September on buisness, great location a few blocks from \"everything\".\\nBig rooms from an NYC hotel, good service, a great litle starbucks across the road for a coffee fix Here's the skinny: Stay here for access to a great gym onsite (Gravity), best breakfast and decent lap pool. Stay away if you want A/C in the off season (I hate hot rooms), restaurant for dinner (they have a burger place), and a bathroom big enough for two.\\nAs a Starwood Gold member, they give you an upgrade. My first visit last month yielded me a junior suite, very nice with plenty of space and stall shower. On this visit they gave me a park view room that was tiny, smoke filled and hot. The MOD informed me they shut down the cooling after the season and upon request, they could have a window opened. Really? The bathtub was wedged into the bathroom like a cruise ship's standard room. Ouch!\\nBreakfast at Norma's is an experience. Fresh everything, they make oversized everything and charge accordingly. French press coffee is served for $8 and worth it. Pancakes are the star and you won't eat them all. Downside: Expect to pay $50 p/p.\\nGravity is attached to the hotel in the basement but privately owned. Every free weight you can want, yoga room, plenty of treadmills, and full locker room (sauna). Worth the $10 day pass and opens at 5:30am.\\nVery nice intimate bar with great snacks and small glasses of wine and martinis. $22 for a house cab is high even for NY standards. \\nIf burgers aren't your thing, great Italian across the street and Nobu is a block away.\\nCould be the perfect hotel only if. . .good for business without spouses or kids. Andrew at front desk was super friendly and helpful. I arrived early but was accommodated with ease.\\nI requested extra towels during my stay and they were brought within 5 minutes.\\nBeautiful hotel with a great location, and very friendly, efficient staff.\\nWould stay again! Loved our one night stay at the Le Parker Meridien (using cash n points), was upgraded to a park view room (https://www.starwoodhotels.com/preferredguest/property/photos/index.html?propertyID=1909#photo_section_2Link) with a central park view (gold SPG) which was just beautiful in every way (shower could have been a bit nicer but bathroom as a whole was nice, and the tv was just a CRT flatscreen Sony Wega - not an LCD). beautiful pool on roof. \\nDidn't like that wifi wasn't automatically free in the lobby (had to keep asking for new 1/2 hour passwords and then getting a no). would have cost just $15 to get unlimited internet, but i'm cheap and most hotels will give you free wifi in the lobby at least. Also, lobby is great but could use a bit more seating (maybe not needed, since wifi isn't free). Other than that, the place was what we expected from a high class hotel (great bed etc). My wife and I recently stayed at the Le Parker Meridien for the first time. What an experience. The staff is wonderful! The room was gorgeous! The view..oh my god what a view of Central Park. I've been use to staying at hotels in the past in Times Square and not wanting to look out the window because the scenery was blah.. This hotel's view of Central Park is just amazing..and the price of the room no more then the Times Square hotels. I would highly recommend if you are looking to stay in Manhattan bypass Times Square and head to this hotel...you will not go wrong.. Oh I almost forgot the rooftop pool is another WOW! and the burger joint on the first floor is amazing. We had booked for three families to stay in November 2011. One of the three had a baby. \\nConfusion in deciding which room was for the family with the baby landed us with a a mini suite. This was amazing. On top of that, we had a very good service from the staff whenever we needed it. Just a quick business trip (1 day), but the staff was friendly and helpful and the location great. Room was spacious with a good desk and comfortable bed and sitting area. Would definitely stay again. Stayed there on a recent weekend. Got a good price on the room, especially by New York standards.\\nRoom was clean, good-sized and relatively modern although the TV could use some updating. Bed was very large and comfortable and bedding was quite nice. Room had a very useful desk in front of the window with an actual Aeron chair which was a nice touch. The bathroom was decent-sized, had plenty of good quality towels and nice shampoo, conditioner, etc. Only small negative was that the tub had been remodeled using a \"bath fitter\" type insert so the floor was a bit springy (yes I'm being picky).\\nLocation is excellent, adjacent Carnegie Hall, one block from Central Park, a ten minute walk to Times Square and a block from two subway lines. Our room on the 20th floor had a partial view of the park.\\nLobby was OK, but nothing special, but the lobby bar is definitely worth a visit. A couple good beers on tap (Leffe for one) and everything came with a cocktail mix of warm nuts and very yummy deep fried olives. I didn't make it to the \"Burger Joint\", but in the lobby, behind a curtain is literally a burger joint with $8 burgers. Where else are you going to find that in NY?\\nVery good experience and would visit again. Building work on one side - we were in room 821 and got a rude awaking @ 7.30ish on Monday morning by the site - not sure how the staff cope, the lobby was even noisier. Got moved to 3208 nice view of park, I think the staff were expecting a complaint - but a smaller room. But Hotel v central, and they do have burgers on site - not that there is any shortage of food any where close Nice hotel\\nExcellent breakfast\\nOld rooms\\nLack of proper closet annoying Just back from 4 wonderful days in NYC! The location of the Le Parker is perfect. You are out of the hustle/craziness of Times Square etc, but still in walking distance. Close to Central Park, shopping. theater district and restuarants.\\nWe found it interesting that this hotel is rated 4-5 stars. We have stayed at many Starwood properties including the Meridien in Barcelona and Bora Bora. We are Gold Members. This hotel is not a 5 star by any means. It is \"comfortable\" not over the top chi chi like a St Regis or other 4-5 star Starwood properties.\\nBeware of the construction, this is mentioned and in several other reviews. Starts promptly at 7a, Don't know how the hotel staff deals with this for 8-10 hours a day. It will \"jar\" from your sleep!\\nThe burger joint is worth a try, order from your room, pick it up, much faster than standing in line. Good burger, not the best ever. In a city like NY, where hotels abound and so should outstanding customer service, this hotel did the job, but that was about it. The mix of somewhat modern lobby, rooms in between contemporary and dated, as well as lounge/ bar area, made for a confusing mix of impressions. That is not to say the staff was not friendly, nor that the breakfast at the hotel restaurant was not outstanding. Overall, a mixed bag, but would opt for another location, if character is what you're looking for. In planning a 5-day romantic New York get away for my girlfriend's birthday, I didn't think I could do much better than a high-floor room with an expansive view of Central Park. The location was perfect for museums and shops, and the view was all I was hoping for. We were also excited that the hotel's associated gym had squash courts, and we brought our rackets.\\nUnfortunately, on our first morning (a Saturday) we were awakened by relatively constant jack-hammer noise from a construction site next door. Considering our high-floor, it was surprisingly loud. Since we’re from California, we would already be inclined to sleep late, and on vacation, sleeping in seemed even more valuable. Of course, the construction was completely out of the hotel's control, but we decided to move to somewhere quieter.\\nSince we had used points, the hotel said they couldn't really do anything for us, but urged us to call Starwood. After 30 minutes on the phone, they managed to move us to the W on Lexington. The downside was that we lost our \"fifth night free\" discount, and had to pay for the final night – an unexpected expense. So, we had the hassle of moving, plus the added cost of the room.\\nAll-in-all, not a great experience, but I'd certainly consider trying the hotel again after the construction is complete. The view really was beautiful. Nice hotel on excellent location just one block from Central Park\\nIf you like burgers: Burger Joint is hidden behind the curtain in the atrium lobby and if you'r a guest you don't have to wait in line( which is extremely long)\\nStarbucks just across the street From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, all personnel, especially the people at the front desk and concierge desk were friendly and so helpful. Our room was clean and a great place to sleep. Highly recommend a stay here. Part of the Starwood Properties - the Parker is wonderfully located for midtown meetings and Broadway as well as dining. Right now (October, 2011) someone else is building a hotel next door so ask about construction noise before you make a reservation (it starts at 7:00 am). I always stay here on my frequent trips to NY. I stayed at the Market Meridien 4 nights during the September 11th weekend, at the time there was construction right next to the hotel. Even so, we could not hear a peep from our room, so that was great. The location is the most remarkable thing about this hotel, excellent. I used to stay in the Time Square hotels but this is much better. The room was a semi-suite room, quite comfortable, but you could tell it needed a refresh - not bad though. Main gripe was the A/C unit was leaking the whole time were there and no-one came to fix it, the carpet was socking wet.\\nTip - There is a fantastic little restaurant on the corner call Rue 57, we had lunch there and liked it very much. I order the lamb mini burners and it was amazingly good! I am always on the look-out for a good business hotel in NYC. I decided to try this hotel based on TA reviews and the location. The hotel faces 56th St though there is also an entrance on 57th street. The reception seems always crowded with people at most times of the day. The check-in was smooth but I remembered to ask for a room NOT facing the construction outside the hotel and was lucky to get one. I probably would not be giving this hotel a good review if I had a room facing the construction site. So take note.\\nService was average. The concierge seemed disinterested when I asked for a running map of Central Park; the bell hops spent most of their time chatting inside. But rooms were nice and modern looking although on closer inspection you realize the TV is still CRT. Bathrooms were decent. Small closet space only though. Hardly any view from the room. But the room was quiet and I didnt hear traffic noise which is important and the noise from other rooms was minimal. The location is also great for shopping, Central Park, and food outlets. There is a good coffee bar in the hotel though they only have pastries to go with the coffee. But there is a Dean &amp; Deluca right across the street, where you can pick up meals, coffee etc. Starbucks too. There is a subway close by and I walked to 7th ave to get cabs when I needed to. Would recommend this hotel for business.. This hotel is literally WALKING distance from Times Square, Theater District, Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Nobu 57, etc. You are paying for this amazing location. We were in town for the marathon and the staff suprisingly did not seem overwhelmed. I read a couple brilliant tips from tripadvisor before we arrived: ask for a room location far from the construction (call in advance); rent a mini-fridge ($40 for our entire stay); eat at Norma's and the Burger Joint (both excellent). Our room was silent, we heard no construction until we were in the lobby. The staff was amazingly friendly (front desk, maids). The decor is modern but we liked it - especially the revolving armoire in the middle of the room. The carpet was my only complaint about the room. Dark and hard to tell if it was clean or dirty. Toiletries are excellent (Peter Thomas Roth). The minibar has very steep prices (literally $5 for a can of coke) but we rented a minifridge on the first day and walked to the drugstore around the corner and stocked up with H2O, beer, gatorade, etc. Also of note - only a block from Nobu 57 - one of the best restaurants in the city. We will definitely return here! Le Parker Meridien has the most comfortable mattresses anywhere! We've stayed here 3 different times and the futon type mattress in the rooms have all been the BEST. It is worth the price to stay on the floors 26 and above, especially on the park side. Easy access from 56th or 57th street. Not far from subways. Great location - 2 short blocks from Central Park and Columbus Circle, easy walk to Rockefeller Center and Times Square. Staff is courteous and efficient. Hotels toiletries have the best fragrance! Superior King room is a little small, but the junior suite is roomy and very comfortable. Don't miss the view from the Pool Roof Deck - take your camera and walk around the outside to take pictures - spectacular view of the city as well as the park. This has been one of my favorite places to stay in NY for years. The location is great and the staff are wonderful. The rooms are a nice size by NY standards. Great gym as well. The breakfast place in the lobby is fabulous as is the burger joint - best in the city. The beds are comfortable and rooms are very clean and quiet.\\nMinuses: The Espresso bar/cocktail lounge is dark, dated and depressing. All the common areas need new lighting and a fresh, new look. The TVs are old fashioned flat screen tube TVs from the 90s. Wonderful location, rooms and STAFF! We have made the Parker Meridien our \"home\" in New York for the last 5 years and never plan to make a change! The hotel is in a great location two blocks south of the centre of Central Park. There is a Starbucks across the street from the front entrance, but you will need to venture farther afield (several blocks) to find breakfast/brunch on a Sunday (the wait at the hotel’s restaurant was over two hours). The Burger Joint in the hotel’s lobby is a good choice for burgers, but make sure you have enough people in your group to send someone off to grab a table as soon as it becomes available.\\nCheck-in for us was fast and straightforward, and we were allowed to check in at around noon on a holiday weekend. The staff was quite pleasant and personable. We found them to be quite accommodating throughout our stay, and when we requested something, it was handled quickly and professionally.\\nThe two sets of elevators meant a stop-over on the way to the 42nd-floor swimming pool. There appeared to be a charge for guests to use the fitness centre.\\nWe had a Deluxe room that would have seemed spacious in the Prairies and felt downright palatial in Manhattan. My partner and I had divergent views of the décor. I liked the Mad Men 1960’s feel of the room (with built-in furniture and a small bar) that seemed glamourous in comparison to the Westins we normally frequent. Though the room was spotless and everything was in excellent repair, my partner found it dated (though admitting the service and location were better than the Westin Times Square). The swivelling television stand was cool and useful for watching in bed or in the sitting area, but it is probably time to get rid of the CRT television in favour of flat-panels. The room was very quiet during our stay, and the bathroom was clean and modern (though I would have preferred a shower door to the curtain). Our view was of buildings, as one would expect in New York (though the park view from the pool level was quite nice).\\nOne thing I particularly liked about this hotel is that everything was branded and felt expensive/high-quality/tailored. From towels to shot-glasses to gel-ink pens, everything was marked Parker Méridien, and the normal hotel stuff (do not disturb sign, keycards, etc) were more whimsical than you would expect based on the marble-and-columns lobby. The hotel has gone out of its way to differentiate itself from major chains (though still Starwood). Interestingly (given the abundance of generic hotels in New York), we have since noticed this hotel’s interior (hallways and rooms) used in both Law and Order and The Good Wife.\\nThanks to the excellent service, good location, and generous room size, this is my new favourite hotel in Midtown. For this price-point, this is THE hotel to stay at in Manhattan. It is located near subway lines that allow you to easily get around. It is a short walk to Time Square, but far enough away to avoid the crowds. Unlike Time Square hotels, the staff at the Parker care how you are treated and want your repeat business. They were always polite and accommodating. They even provided a fan to help block out city noise at night. Things like that make a huge difference to me, and that is what sets them apart. The Parker Meridien has the most helpful staff who can give the scoop on nearby treasures and how to get there. It is also close to the theater district as well as 5th avenue high fashion to 8th avenue restaurant bargains. I wish our stay was longer. Safe and convienent mid-town location. Good restaurants, shopping, and the park all in easy walking distance. Rooms clean, staff helpful The lobby is inviting, and the staff members are friendly and helpful. I never had to wait in line, and, without asking for it, I was given a free upgrade to a very spacious, well-decorated room with a comfortable bed and a decent view. I assume that's because I'm a Starwood Rewards member, but the nearby Sheraton has never done that for me. The only source of disappointment about my room was the outdated, four-by-three, standard-definition TV. I've come to expect HDTV in nice hotels. By far, the biggest negative was the insanely loud pounding noise from a nearby construction site, which started Monday morning around 7am and went on almost non-stop until I left around 10:30am. But of course, that's not the hotel's fault. I definitely plan to stay at Le Parker Meridien the next time I'm in New York. Hopefully, by then, the noisy construction will have been completed, and the TV's will have been upgraded. One final note: I love the hole-in-the-wall burger joint off the lobby. What a quirky, fun feature. I kind of feel like I'm in on a secret, and the burger was fantastic. Great location, 5 minute walk from time's square and 5th avenue, surrounded by nice restaurant, 2 minute walk from subway. Really nice gym, overpriced and Internet is shotty and extremely overpriced. Business center is not free either. My husband and I took a weekend off (sans kids) to spend in NYC. We loved the Parker Meridien and hope to come back. The rooms were spacious (we had a junior suite), the beds comfy and the staff very attentive. The location was extraordinary. We walked most everywhere. . . . and brunch at Normas was fantastic. There was some construction next door, but we only realized on Monday morning as we were leaving since apparently they did not work over the weekend. The hotel room was kind of small and not very fancy but the staff was friendly, the room was clean, the price was great, and the location is fantastic. I really enjoyed my stay there. Just spent 2 nights at the hotel and was just as good as it was 3years ago. They have the best gym and I'm particular. Also getting a late check out was no problem. Staff was top notch and the helped for what ever I needed. I travel a lot and always stay at 4 to 5 star hotels and this was as good as I could hope for. I will be using the hotel again in May. Great stay. Clean Room. Nice and new furniture. Very Confortable bed. Very Luxury hotel in the heart of Manhattan. For sure I will return and recommend to my friends. The draw for this hotel is the restaurants and location, Norma's is a NY staple, the crunchy french toast is amazing, and the burger joint is a fun NYC experience. The focus of this trip was fun in central park so this hotel is a great location for spending time in central park yet close to times square and other sites. The room was cold as only the A/C was working, I am assuming that the heat for the hotel had not been switched on yet for winter so they brought up a space heater. Had a junior suite with a decent view of 56th street and ample space for a NYC hotel. Staff was attentive, but some things took a bit of time to get delivered. Overall a good stay and would stay there again, my favorite property in NYC remains the Chatwal. We have just returned from 6 nights, the staff were very helpful and efficient, our one complaint about a slow emptying sink was dealt with in minutes. The location was excellent for us and the swimming pool was very welcome. We would have preferred a more modest breakfast experience, we only had one and then went out. We would also have preferred a better choice of restaurant but again went out and found several good ones nearby. The room was extremely comfortable and quiet and we slept very soundly. The atmosphere is very business orientated but overall it was a good stay. This is the fourth time I have spent the weekend at Le Parker Meridien and each time, I think it gets better!!! The location is the main reason: walking distance to Central Park, Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue, Frick, etc. I only took a taxi ride twice during our stay. The rooms at the hotel are really nice: beds are perfect, amenities are sufficient, and the rooms quiet and clean. The staff at the Parker are intelligent, helpful and courteous. Can't wait to stay again, and I will!! Le Parker Meridien is a great place to stay while visiting New York. It is centrally located closed to major locations. Their service is A+ and the staff makes you feel welcomed right from checking in time! We will go back there again! I was happy to find a room with reasonable price at a very busy season in June 2011 (eight out of ten hotels were full). The hotel was close to Central Park, and not far from Time Square. My wife and I were thrill to see the contemporary designed Junior suite. Even with the sofa bed for my daughter opened, the room was spacious and comfortable. The staffs at the front desk and concierge were extremely helpful. The staff at the house keeping was efficient and friendly in providing us with an electric kettle within minutes. We were happy with the three days stay in New York City. \\nIf I might give some suggestions, I would say the computer at the front desk to be upgraded to be faster, the wired internet connection at my room to be free and to be connected continuously the whole day (no need for me to answer questions on the front page each time), and the bathroom being provided with double vanity tops and mirrors. Stayed for one night with my husband. The last review was very accurate. Nothing wrong with this hotel, good svc., clean etc. But I would not recommend it for a romantic getaway. It had more of a business vibe. The decor in the halls were very dark and dismal and the room was bland and minimalistic in decor. Very dorm room-esk. Can't speak for all the rooms as we had a standard/superior. No amenities in the room (just a tiny shampoo and conditioner and bar soap. So look at it as a nice place to sleep in a really good location. Nothing more, nothing less. If you are looking for a boutique type hotel with atmosphere and those little extra's, this is not the place. I stood here using my points so I am glad I did not have to pay the sticker price. We have stayed at more upscale, pricier hotels on special occasions and you do get what you pay for as far as atmosphere and amenities. But remember its NY and as my husband says about most of the hotels, \" they are all glorified apartment buildings with a marquis out front\" lol. This is the second time I stayed at Le Parker Meridien and since nothing has changed over the last year I decided to write a review this time. To start I want to say that there is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is clean, staff are polite and the location is in a good spot between Central Park and Midtown/Times Sq - but lots of hotels can say this in NYC!\\nI used points for this hotel as I was not keen on paying what I consider to be well above what they should be charged for the services provided. No coffee or teas in the room, the TV unit takes up much more room than it should and the TV is old and barely watchable. \\nAdditionally, you have to pay to use the downstairs gym - $10 and internet (again a Starwood addiction of making everyone but platinum member pay, even though I am Gold) is $16.20.\\nThe shower was great, bed comfortable and 2 restaurants popular and know across the city. Again not a bad choice, but nothing too exciting. Desk team and Valet superior, check in fast and friendly--- bar/food very good---concierge team (at least on this night) was lackluster with no urgency to serve.... Televisions are old (big and take up too much space) but good size screens--- no coffee in room, a personal rant--- I hate to pay for internet, so I used my hotspot-- at $600 guys - throw in the internet! Bed was awesome, amenities very nice... Would stay again Stayed here for 5 days/4 nights. We paid a premium for the hotel rate because there was a UN meeting going on and I don't know what else which made the traffic unbearable. I discovered use of the subway toward the end of my trip and that was much more efficient and cost effective. The subway entrance is right at the end of the street so it's super convenient. The service at the hotel was okay. I don't know if the heating/AC system was working properly in my room b/c there seemed to be constant cold air coming out of the vents even though I had cranked up the temperature, so I was always a little chilly in the room. And the hotel does not provide bathrobes, nor the usual toiletries such as cotton balls, qtips, razors, toothpaste, etc. I consider that to be extremely stingy considering I'm paying $500+ a night! How much can a razor cost the hotel? Maybe a dollar at most? I travel frequently and have never come across a hotel that does not provide these items upon request. \\nAlso the swimming pool is pretty small. It is difficult to find a time when the pool is not full of 2 or 3 people swimming laps already. And the pool can really only fit 2 people swimming laps comfortably. There is no jacuzzi at all. \\nOverall, I would not stay here again. I feel like you get very little for your money here. The Parker is one of my favorite hotels in Manhattan. I love the location of the hotel (just south of Central Park) and close to shopping on 5th avenue, Rockefeller plaza, Times Square, nearby subway stops. The service at this hotel is always great and I like the modern feel of the hotel. It's also got great restaurants - Norma's (good brunch) and the hidden burger joint. The one downside is the hotel is starting to look a little worn and dated (tube TV's in most rooms). Other than that, I would totally recommend as great mid-town hotel. I've been to Le Parker Merdiain in NYC twice the in past three months and have always loved my stay. It's not complete without a nightcap at Nave and breakfast at Norma's. Next time I'll try te Burger oin which everyone says is out of this world, too! I can see where this hotel was pretty \"hip\", \"cool\" and especially \"schticky\" in the 90s with its shot glasses in the bathroom (instead of normal water glasses)... casual \"hey, I'm funny and witty\" type language, etc. Seems a bit dated now but it's not all that important in your overall stay anyway!\\nIt was a little annoying that our room wasn't ready at 5pm when we checked in but the worst part of the stay was when the woman at check-in referred to my husband as my son. Yes, my son. Yes, he looks quite young (lucky!) but we're the same age and I know for sure that we don't look THAT far apart in age. Maaaaaybe 5 years? The woman had an accent so perhaps it was a language barrier? Highly doubt it but it was quite rude.\\nOther than that... we stayed on Starwood Points and got a great room on the 15th floor. Quiet... clean... comfortable... good size. Great location. Would stay again. Oh, and we remembered when we stayed here last time (a few years ago) that the breakfast at Norma's is quite expensive. Save your pennies and go to Starbucks across the street. My husband and I stayed at the Le Parker Meridien in Manhattan for the first time to celebrate a birthday and loved every moment. We found our room to be very nice and only a few blocks away from Radio City and Central Park. I like the convenience of having a gym, pool and two wonderful places to enjoy a meal so close by. Looking forward to another stay in the near future. I am a starwood member so I try to only stay at starwood properties when I can. Between the W's, Sheraton's, and this hotel, I will definitely continue staying at the Meridien. Rooms are basic, comfy bed, nice bathrooms. When I stayed I was upgraded to a junior suite which was nice and big, the best part for sure was the massive bathroom. Some parts of the hotel could use an upgrade, but overall it is nice. I have not had a bed bug incident here on any of my multiple stays, and given the issues NYC has, that is a thumbs up for this property. My wife and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien over the Victoria Day (Canada) long weekend in May. It was my 4th time in NYC in the last 3 years and it was definitely my favourite hotel (better than the Hilton, Park Hyatt, Marriott, etc.). I was obviously a little worried about the bed bug situation in NYC but the cleanliness of the hotel alleviated my concerns. \\nOverall, the hotel was great - large rooms for an NYC hotel with contemporary decor. The concierge was more than helpful in providing directions and suggestions for food. The subway was very convenient - two lines within a 5 minute walk. Museums and shopping are close as well.\\nI didn't eat at the hotel but have heard good things about the brunch and the burgers there.\\nI would certainly recommend choosing the hotel. room was very large by NY standards. Clean, beautiful linens, comfortable bed, and wonderful staff. This hotel uis conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan. I stayed here a few years ago and felt the staff were rude, but when I stayed here this month, they were very warm and welcoming, so I would now highly recommend this hotel. The one thing I wish could be improved is that there are long waits for the high-rise elevators. Otehrwise evrything was great. Was pleasantly surprised by my first time stay at Le Parker Meridien. We moved form another hotel where our stay was not as pleasant. At Le Parker Meridien, staff were tremendously friendly and helpful, terrific location, comfortable and well appointed rooms. If you eat at Norma's in the lobby, take your appetite or share a plate as the portions are HUGE - the food was terrific as well. We would go back to Le Parker Meridien without hesitation. Nice hotel (wonderful lobby) with a convenient location. Concierge staff was rude and not helpfull at all. Overall management should invest more on people and service, less on hardware. Nice vidas, quiet room, excelent locación and service We loved our room - a beautiful room with a spectacular Central Park view!! Thanks to Emilie in customer service and all the staff..our stay for my wife's birthday and our anniversary was awesome! We walked from the hotel to Times Sqaure and 2 shows, Rockefeller Center, and Central Park! We took the subway to the WTC site and a cab to Lincoln Center (we could have walked but would have been difficult in high heels for my wife!). I stayed here on business last year and this was an excellent hotel. The beds were comfortable, rooms were nicely decorated and clean. Most importantly, the rooms were quite – we were originally staying at another hotel in New York that had a disco on roof that turned out to be a nightmare and coming to this hotel was a relief after that. \\nI had ordered internet service for my room and it did not work properly – but when I checked out I was reimbursed for this, so they did the right thing. If I were to come to New York, I would most likely stay here again. Do not waste your time for this New York hotel if you are used to nice Starwood properties. We stayed and were very disappointed with everything - from service to rooms (junior suite).\\nIf you are platinum (which I am) in the starwood system (also Platinum in Marriott system), you will be disappointed!! I've stayed all over the world in fantastic hotels and this is not one of them. Maybe I'm just spoiled - but one gets used to certain standards and being treated like a special guest. \\nI am not going to get into all the details, but as things continued to go wrong, management did not accommodate, even after personally walking down to the front desk.\\nMy advice - stay away!! Got the W Union Square instead - this place is a W wannabe, be far from it! I stayed here on points\\nThe location was great - but we did a lot of walking in Manhattan and we walked past a lot of hotels, whether this hotel is better value than the others I can't say as we didn't actually pay for it.\\nCompared to the other SPG hotels - I'd say the location is probably comparable to all of them, none are far from the subway, all have their pros and cons.\\nI can say that the interior of this hotel is new.\\nThe exterior front is undergoing construction - as is a lot of other stuff in the area.\\nThe lobby is tiny - though with all the mirrors you can't really notice. \\nThere is a gym - we didn't use it, it looked ok and you have to pay $10 i think to use it.\\nThere is a pool on the 42 floor - whether you swim or not you should go up - you can see central park from here.\\nIf you room is below the 22nd floor you will have no view. We were on 8th and saw some buildings and a construction site.\\nThe elevators are split L-22 and 22-42. You switch at 22 unless you are going to the lobby, if you face north on 22 you might see central park, anything below you are likely below all adjacent buildings.\\nThere is internet - $16.28 a day, you might have to go to guess services to get a cable\\nThere is wireless too, though i didn't try it.\\nThere is a mini bar - no fridge, it explicitly states that the mini bar is electronic and if you want a fridge you have to rent one.\\nThere is no water, coffee etc.\\nThere is a starbucks directly across the street (and up the street and around the corner...) \\nI didn't try any of the cafes or restaurants in the hotel or in the vicinity of the hotel\\nAll in all, i think this hotel was fine. The room was small, but I have nothing else to compare to in new york.\\nI think they were changing the beds to sheraton sweet sleeper, i didn't have a problem with my bed but my husband noted it wasn't standard spg issue.\\nIf you are paying and expecting a view then either get a guarantee that you will get a view or you will likely be disappointed.\\nThis hotel was also very quiet - for us anyway - likely the fact that we were in an area with offices helped this as there didn't seem to be much noise. I booked a room for my father as part of a weekend 75th birthday party. The hotel staff did a great job providing us a room with a great view. The staff were friendly and responsive. My father loved his stay. Most everything was top notch but the building is rather old. Accordingly, we didn't have the ability to control our room's air conditioning (the entire hotel is kept at a fixed temp... we were told to open the windows if we got warm) and the sound deadening between rooms was lacking. We had a connecting room, which could have made this issue seem worse than it actually is. But overall, I found these to be acceptable issues given the price and location. My wife and I are New York natives but checked in for two nights to celebrate our Anniversary. In the week leading up to our stay, I think I called the hotel at least once a day trying to arrange plans/get suggestion for area restaurants and was greeted with super-friendly service every time.\\nI arranged for my wife to check in a few hours before I was able to arrive and also coordinated an in-room massage for her before my arrival. Everything went off without a hitch. \\nSince it was our Anniversary (I noted that in my reservation) we were upgraded to a Park view room. It was really amazing to wake up to that view during the days we spent there.\\nAdditionally I got some recommendations for restaurants nearby we'd never heard of before and both turned to be excellent!\\nAs someone who travels several times a year I always appreciate when I feel that the hotel staff goes above and beyond for their guests, and this hotel does so with a rare exuberance for New York This hotel is perfectly placed a block south of central park, with a pool on the rooftop, and a great burger joint in the lobby. It's my go-to place when travelling to NYC. Good gym and restaurant as well. \\nThere are a few minor annoyances - no tea or coffee in the room, no bottled water included, no internet included, and the room service food sometimes seems not on par with what you'd expect. \\nStaff are always helpful and punctual however, and I've changed rooms easily on occasion. Very good, pleasant clean hotel in excellent midtown location. Beds are excellent. huge rooms for a midtown manhattan hotel. Comfy bed, nice amenities, friendly staff. Good value for the money, too, and you can't beat the location. Much larger room than I expected, very quiet. Easy to get everywhere I wanted to go: park, theatre, museums. Staff was courteous and helpful. Cute touch with classic cartoons playing in the elevators. Especially accessible if coming in from west side, One-way street travels east, pull up to hotel leave your car and you're free. As everyone's already said, mid town attractions within walking distance. Park view rooms are lovely. Travellers who are not used to the city will be very comfortable here, as there are helpful staff and great service.\\nRestauarants are known for their delicious food--plenty of patrons who aren't hotel guests. After Carnegie Hall esp convenient. If you don't feel like a big meal but are not vegetarian, walk down the little hall near reception desk, behind curtain, and find yourself at Burger Joint. Sudden transformation from formal lobby to ultra informal burgers and fries. Extremely tasty, quick, efficient even if there's a long line. Plus menus in many languages. Night we went the staff were friendly, great sense of humor even though faced with a hungry crowd. Ordering system spelled out for you! Food comes in brown paper bags you can eat there in a booth or take out. \\nAlso, room was not cramped as some NYC rooms are. WATER PRESSURE WAS GREAT in the shower. Modern decor. They seem to have fallen in love with orange in a big way, but it's more of an accent color than a dominant one. People complaining about rooms needing an update were perhaps booking on discount sites? I booked on hotel web site and had very clean new room with great view. Although there was staging up for some work being done, there was no noise or other hassle. Also! Very quiet in halls and room. Bath products very cool. Amazing style, friendliness, cleanliness and convenience near Central Park. Every expressed need is met by hotel staff. We spend two nights here for a weekend trip to the Big Apple. And we had a blast! The staff were very friendly and helpful, we were upgraded to a Park View room which had a lovely view of Central Park. The location is perfect for shopping, close to 5th Ave and also the MoMa and other sights are at walkable distance. If I have to name anything negative it has to be the charge of $16 for internet on top of the room rate. And if you decide to have breakfast at Norma's (in the lobby) be prepared to wait (long) and spend more then average on a (fantastic) breakfast. Great hotel in a perfect location. Rooms were spacious for a NY hotel, well appointed. Staff were extremely helpful. Housekeeping was amazing. Anything we asked for was sent right up to our room within minutes. I've stayed at a lot of other mid-town hotels, but I always come back to the Parker. From the in house dining to the beautiful rooms with great views it just can't be beat. We stayed here for our 5th anniversary. It was great - very nice staff, fun restaurants downstairs and easy cab / walking distance to so many attractions. I loved the Le Parker Meridien - friendly staff, well appointed rooms, beautifully decorated but c'mon - $329/nt? Really? It's NYC, but there has to be some limits. I also had a great bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup and a wonderful Grilled Cheese for $53 from room service. Yikes...\\nThis is a great property that does everything right, but I really struggle spending big bucks for a place to sleep and a late night repast (I arrived after 11:00pm). \\nI'd stay here again - but only if someone else was paying. Le Parker Meridien is a great hotel from several aspects: \\n1) Location - can't beat it for midtown. Convenient to everything.\\n2) Service - service was friendly and helpful. My key got demagnetized and the front desk immediately sent someone up to help me instead of me having to go back downstairs\\n3) Overall - the rooms were nice. I would even say a little larger than the typical NYC hotel room. Bath products were very nice as well.\\nMy only complaint is that the elevators were ridiculously slow. I think maybe only one elevator was running for the entire tower side of the building but this problem persisted for both days I was there. This just made you have to leave a little earlier than you would normally but overall not too big of a deal.\\nI would definitely recommend Le Parker Meridien to anyone wanting to stay in midtown. New York hotels generally suck. Tiny rooms for the price, way too much comotion and noise coming from outside and inside the hotel. Le Parker Meridien is different, It's an oasis. I look forward to a few minutes away from the chaos. I've stayed at this hotel before and return because of the great location and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend it but do wish their restaurant wasn't quite so fancy/expensive. This hotel has a great location, the rooms were comfortable, and the service was good. If you are looking for a hotel with a great bar and a restaurant that serves alcohol this is not the place to stay. But if you want a quiet hotel this is the place to stay. The bad: Not much, just long waits for elevator. \\nThe good: friendly, helpful staff, excellent physical facilities, great location, great view (when we told the front desk it was our 25th wedding anniversary, she upgraded us to a Central Park view room). Norma's had a great breakfast although be prepared to pay for it. The location was close to Lincoln Center, 5th and Madison Ave shopping, Central Park and the theater district but was out of the crowds of Time Square. We parked on 56th and 8th Avenue, about two blocks away, for $38 per day and could have paid less if we had parked a few more blocks west. We will definitely return. I stay in Midtown at least yearly for business and have tried multiple hotels: have found one I want to come back too and that is memorable!\\nFirst the critiques: the rooms (and I believe we had the most basic type) are not amazing. That said, while understated, they are convenient and very comfortable: great beds, easy temperature control, good bathroom, good closet and convenient desk space. \\nThe elevators are temperamental: they sometimes close a little fast. The internet fee is very costly.\\nNow for compliments: service is good. This was particularly evident at the swimming pool where attendants were helpful, polite, child friendly. Talking about the pool: nice space, and unbeatable view. Location: outstanding, closer to Central Park then Time Square but really not far from both. A few steps from landmarks like Carnegie Hall and The Russian Tea Room. Talking about food: some of the best NYC food is at the hotel! Norma's breakfast is truly a metaphysical experience. The Burger Joint has a cult following for good reasons. Finally the gym, though not free, is truly the best spanning multiple levels and rooms: will pay for access to a fabulous gym rather than a few crummy machines.\\nFinally, this hotel is slightly more upscale and slightly more expensive than many of the usual midtown business hotels, but online advance rates were decent/competitive. Great location, wonderful rooms, fabulous service. I really love this hotel and stay here frequently when in New York City. Can't beat the location. Love the Burger Joint and there are so many great places to eat nearby. The high quality sheets make for a good night's rest and the service is top rate. All in all for the $, this mis my top choice in the Big Apple. Consistently outstanding! Our holiday was booked thro Expedia to this hotel. When we arrived only rooms avail were with Kingsize beds, no twin beds with park view which was what we had booked. Would not upgrade us but told us may be avail next day, we were too tired to argue so took these. Next day a mess was left on our room phone to say 2 rooms were avail with park views if we wanted to swop over but we were happy where we were and didn't want to waste any more time repacking suitcases. This hotel is a great find in the area, Fabulous shopping is a block away! \\nMy only complaint is paying for the internet in the room when it's free in the lobby. It should be free period! Great staff ... great location ... what a wonderful weekend. We'll be back. Stayed here for 5 nights using Starwood points. Now keep in mind that I am Platinum with SPG so my review might be a bit skewed so I will not point out any special treatment I received due to my status.\\nI traveled with my wife and 2 year old daughter. We were in a Jr Suite on the 25th floor with a city view. The view from that side of the hotel was nothing special but from the pool area was pretty spectacular. Staff upon check in was superb. Bags were delivered to my room promptly and check in was super fast. Housekeeping was wonderful as well.\\n2 things that separate this property from the other 2 dozen or so I've stayed at in NYC. It is quiet. I don't know if it's because I was 25 floors above the street but I was not disturbed by street noise as I usually am at other hotels. Also there wasn't any sort of party crowd at this property so the lobby and hallways were relatively quiet at all times of day and night. Finally, in the room there were no weird noises coming from any broken AC or elevators or whatever makes noises throughout the night in most of the older hotels in the city. It was nothing but peace and quiet.\\nLocation was perfect. 2 blocks to Central Park, 5th Ave shopping, all restaurants you could ever want, etc. We even walked to Times Square a couple of times and that only took about 15 minutes. It is also on a relatively quiet street so not a huge sense of urgency and panic getting in/out of taxis.\\nI will definitely stay here again - especially when I am on vacation with my family. I have stayed in countless hotels, from 5-star to dumpy $100/night places. And I've never had to call housekeeping or the frontdesk as often as I did at the Meridien. We were promised turndown service and then it never showed up. Not a big deal except the fact that my kids (who were supposed to be sleeping on pullout in our suite) had no blankets or pillows. We ha just returned from dinner and they were exhausted but couldn't go to bed. I called and called and no one showed up w/ pillows and blankets for an hour.\\nThis poor service actually started when we checked in - there was a disorganized rush of people. The frontdesk was ill prepared to handle it and unable to organize it. And the poor service continued into the final day when we left for the pool and returned to our room only to find that housekeeping had taken all of our towels and not replaced them.\\nI gave them a bad review on a survey they sent me post trip. That resulted in a hollow promise from someone in corporate that assured me my service would be better \"next time.\" I doubt there will be a next time. This is the only hotel I stay out when in NY. Checking in is always a breeze, the rooms are large for NY, contemporary and well appointed. Having the Burger Joint (NY best burgers) as well as Norma's (NY's best Lemony Pancakes/cream) on site is ideal. It makes it feel like home. . . but with valet and housekeeping services 24/7. Great midtown location, Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, 5th Ave, etc. all within walking distance. I stayed room that faces central park and that was great.\\nAmenities and design of the rooms are classy and functional. Stayed 2 nights at this hotel. The location was superb, everthing was in reach, I walked to Times Square, Rockefeller center, etc. Subway F line very close, and columbus circle with mulitple trains was also very close, just a couple of blocks. I got there very early expecting to just check my luggage with the concierge and check in later, but the desk person was able to get me checked into a room anyway, even though it was well before check in time. Some scaffolding outside the building, but who cares? It's like that all over the place in New York. Awesome beautiful Starwood hotel in a great, near Central Park location. all the touristy stuff- Times Square, The Park, MoMA, 5th Avenue shopping are all right there. But subways to Chelsea, and Village are also right there as well. So get out of midtown and into the real NYC.\\nAlso- The Burger Joint. Best burger in NYC, possibly the country. you will not be sorry.\\nDon't miss Norma's either. Although- split a dish- The food is huge, but s are the prices. Split an entree and get an app. The Service team from the Front Desk for Cleaning Room, passing for Room services and restaurants are very sharp, polite but precise and expend a lot attention for the customer. I think it is the best and friendly service I have experienced in New York.\\nThis location bring you the Central Park so close, nice brands around for shopping, close to Theater District but without collaterals (crowded) and of course very nice restaurants at walk distance. very good stay at the hotel even alone. Great location, close to central park and 5th avenue. Nice centrally located hotel, handy to sub way and main midtown shopping areas and Carnegie Hall and Times Square theatres. \\nQuiet haven in the hustle and bustle of NYC.\\nBreakfast in Norma's restaurant was nice - they have a good range of \"Healthy choices\"\\nRoom was spacious enough and housekeeping did a great job. Mini Bar wasn't working and they offered to move me to another room.\\nMeeting facilities are a little limited - guess that's an issue of NYC real estate being so expensive\\nStaff were friendly and helpful I have enjoyed several stays at Le Parker Meridien. The staff always find me a quiet room away from the elevator, this time away from the street and with a park view. The location near Carnegie Hall and just a few blocks from Lincoln Center is perfect for business and pleasure. But at this price, I would expect a newspaper, free internet and coffee service in the room. The best thing about this hotel is its location, hands down. It is located in between the theater district and Central Park. Both are only a few blocks away. The hotel itself is average. Our room was clean, though the furniture was rather cheap. The bed was somewhat uncomfortable, and the pillows were not very supportive. The bathroom was clean, and the faucets produced hot water quickly. There are no vending machines in the hotel and apparently no convienence store in the lobby, so if you want a drink in your room, your options are to order room service, to use the minibar in the room, or to go outside and find a store. The staff members were friendly. With all that being said, this is not a bad hotel; it's just average. You would be ok staying here, but if you want a hotel that is on the nicer end of the scale, this hotel might not be the one for you. My stay at the Parker Meridien was great. Room with a fabulous view of the park, fun and tasty Norma's Restaurant in the hotel, and amazing service upon check in. Really a great experience! I have only good things to say about Le Parker Meridien. It's a beautiful hotel, clean, nicely appointed, spacious rooms. For a treat, ask for a room with a Central Park view. I even slept well, which is a rarity for me. The room was quiet and the bed very comfortable. We enjoyed drinks at the Knave, the hotel bar, a richly decorated gem with friendly waitstaff and top-notch, hand-crafted cocktails. At first the lack of an in-hotel restaurant, other than the famous burger joint, seems like a flaw, but, you are in mid-town Manhattan, with no shortage of fine places to dine within walking distance. Angelo's Pizza across the street is not to be missed! Don't miss Norma's inside the hotel for breakfast at least once (Huevos Ranchos is very yummy!), but after that, there are plenty of options just out the door. Great location, amazing view of Central Park, but room was small and TV was not very good. Also found dirt/lint on the chair. Treated like I was a second class customer since I did not flash wads of money.\\nThe burger joint off the lobby is a nice touch and was good, but the food does not live up to the hype. Free internet in the bar in the back of the lobby.\\nI would stay here again, but I'd look around first. rooms very nice, clean and modern.\\nservice excellent and kind\\ni can only say positive thinghs Excellent decor and service. Staff demeanor and competence are outstanding. Terrific access to theatre district, museums, restaurants, shopping and Central Park. Don't miss Norma's for Sunday Brunch; bountiful and tasty portions. We have returned to this hotel at least annually for the past six years. We just spent a wonderful treat-yourself weekend at Le Parker Meridien in New York City, and it really was a treat. The hotel decor is elegant--formal marble and columns in the lobby and light wood modern in the rooms, both beautifully done. The location is excellent--around the block from Carnegie Hall, a short walk to Lincoln Center, two blocks to the south end of Central Park, and short walks to subways. The hotel also features a roof-top enclosed heated pool--generous size for a hotel pool-- and a well- equipped gym. There's a highly rated burger joint with top-quality burgers tucked into a corner of the lobby-usually with a long line, which shows how good--and tiny--the place is. Norma's restaurant, also in the lobby, serves a spectacular breakfast, and the small Knave--basically a reconfigured hallway between the main lobby and the north entry--is a comfy espresso, drink, and snack bar. All service staff were on best behavior at all times, not too busy to be friendly--rare in New York and making for a delightful stay. Not a cheap weekend, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. we were going to stay at a hotel that was more money and not nearly as nice, but got lucky with an email from le parker merdien with a sale!!\\nwe stayed at lpm for a lower price then the 2 star hotel we were going to originally book. This was our first stay at a Parker Meridien and we were not disappointed. The room was very spacious (a surprise for NYC) and beautifully furnished. The view of the city was excellent. The concierge was very helpful, giving us excellent tips for dining with a toddler. We were able to walk to Times Square, 5th Avenue, and Central Park very easily and safely. Pricy, but great hotel. Good location, short distance to shops, restaurants, Metro, shows etc. Great service from the concierge reception. Very nice fitness center. Stayed at the hotel for 9 nights in a junior suite. Ask for the family fun package if travelling with children. Wireless internet not included, it should have been. The location is wonderful and you we loved swimming at the 42nd floor looking back to the fifth avenue..... We travel to NYC about 6 times a year and this place is the best...excellent location with it's proximity to Central Park, Time Square &amp; 5th Ave, clean, spacious rooms, good food/bar, rooftop pool, BUT the best reason is the awesome STAFF. From the second you walk in, everyone is professional &amp; goes above and beyond to make your stay pleasant. Honorable Mention to Lisa Tharp in Guest Relations...she could have not been more accomadating this past stay after a small \"snafu\" when we were guests in January. Nothing to complain about here... lovely hotel, lovely staff, very comfortable! Great Midtown location for theater and opera, plus...shopping. Strong staff with more personality than many large hotels. Our room was modern and comfortable with a great bed and fine bedding. The late-night bar is a great place to end your day in New York.\\nWe got a promotional rate at the hotel's site that made this a bargain, besides. It's fair to say we got off to a bad start as when booking we requested interconnecting rooms but upon arrival we were offered rooms that were not even adjacent..which was never going to work with 2 young children. Whilst I understand that interconnecting rooms are never guaranteed, what was frustrating was the denial from the Hotel that the request had been submitted by our travel agent (I double checked and it had). We were offered a diplomatic suite for the first 2 days and inerconnecting for our final 3 nights. The suite was a lovely size although not ideal as there were no separate beds for our 2 kids, rather a sofa bed for them to share..so in the end our eldest slept on cushions on the floor. The \"park view\" interconnecting rooms didn't materialize on day 3 (varying reasons depending on who you spoke to), so we ended up with 10F \"construction site\" view rooms. After being woken at 4am by the noise, from the works opposite the hotel, we were finally moved on day 4 to the rooms we had originally booked. So 3 rooms and the subsequent packing and unpacking for a 5 night stay, hardly ideal. The housekeeping staff were also under severe pressure, our last room wasn't available until after 7pm..unacceptable.\\nSo other than the room debacle, good and bad points.\\nThe room was pretty warm, no problem I thought, I'll just turn down the aircon temperature..wrong! We were told that the whole hotel is on \"heat\" at the moment, so the coolest setting is \"off\". How can a 21st century, 5 star hotel not have independently controlled rooms?\\nScaffolding outside, not mentioned when booking and also the previously mentioned work opposite. I think the rooms are starting to look dated, eg CRT TVs..no flatscreens and a stereo player (in the suite) possibly from the late 80s/early 90s. \\nNo directory of hotel services in our first room, they're being updated apparently, although they were present in our later rooms. I thought the front desk staff were doing an admirable job, clearly a lot of guests had issues and the hotel was extremely busy over the Easter period. I thought the pool on the top floor was a welcome addition and one of the main reasons we booked the hotel. \\nExcellent location for Central Park and Midtown.\\nThe burger bar was a nightmare to get into and overrated, I think the hotel misses a quality restaurant (need to book for breakfast!) and also a larger and more prominent bar. \\nHow can you justify $18 for wireless internet connection, when I've paid $450 per night for each room ?\\nOverall, considering the room rates, I expected better and will certainly be trying elsewhere on my next visit to NYC. Norma's (need reservation) is super breakfast/lunch spot. Lobby bar has great ambience. Rooms comfortable. Shower has best flow of any hotel I have been, true luxury. Location is pretty ideal for business and touring. Great room in a perfect location with a staff to match. Unfortunately, this is a hotel that has lost its glamour. The doormen and concierge act more like thugs then hotel staff. Not very helpful, especially upon arrival. If you're a New Yorker, maybe ok, but if you have travelled, expect less than first class. Really enjoyed this hotel and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was outstanding.\\nQuality of the breakfast was also great with excellent service.\\nWe were a little disappointed in the burger bar. It had such great reviews regarding the quality of the food but once we looked around the curtain and saw how dark and crowded it was we didn't bother and went elsewhere.\\nBed was very comfy but sleep was interupted by subway trains (not really the hotel's fault!, this is New York after all) and some other noisy guests with children running up and down the corridor. Again, hardly the fault of the hotel. \\nExcellent location. Would certainly stay here again. Every staff person that I encountered at the hotel was competent AND helpful. Special kudos to the Front Desk lady who helped me with the address of a restaurant and to the Concierge who arranged for a rental car for me. And then there is NORMA'S! Bacon heaven! I also enjoyed the Knave in the mornings for coffee and a pastry; it is a lovely use of the space. Speaking of space, my guest room was huge by New York standards. Simple in design with lots of closet space; helpful when traveling for several days. There was also a great shower in the bathroom. I lived in Manhattan for six years before relocating to Florida. I return about 3 times per year, and I now almost exclusively stay here! The funny thing is I work for a competing mega-hotel-chain and can get pretty decent rates, but I still choose to use my Starwood points to stay here each time! \\nThe rooms are comfortable and modern, yet very spacious if you can get a Jr. Suite. As others have said, the location is excellent as well. The staff is 100% professional and top-notch. The burger joint is a must-do and the bar, while pricey, is a fun place to hang out for a bit. Just a wonderful place to hang your hat for a few days while in the city!\\nThe only downsides are the many incidental charges: the expensive internet connection at $16/day, but I have a 4G smarthphone with wi-fi so that's solved. The gym I hear is nice, but I refuse to pay $10 to access the gym for 30 minutes of cardio! That's unacceptable in my opinion. \\nFinally, my advice is to hit one of the corner stores in the area and stock up on water, snacks, etc. My favorite is Klein Ernest which is on 6th Ave between 55th and 56th St. There is also a liquor store on 58th between 6th and 7th Ave which is pretty good. I thought Le Parker Meridien was a great and convenient hotel. Loved the hamburger \"joint\" hidden in the lobby. Wonderful experience. Recently stayed at Le Parker Meridien for the second time and it continues to be my favorite hotel in NYC. The rooftop pool is a wonderful amenity and the lobby coffee bar is wonderful - great atmosphere &amp; staff. It is a wonderful place to relax and unwind after a fun-filled day - great coffee &amp; martinis!! There is a top-notch spa and fitness center as well. The curtain hidden Burger Joint still has the world's best burger - If you didn;t know about it you woyuldn't even knoiw it was there but world of mouth has taken care of that!! Get there early or be prepared to wait in line (opens at 11:00 a.m. - lines start at 12:30 p.m.)- it's worth it!! Other than one gentleman who works at the front desk and has an air of superiority (both times we stayed there) the staff is courteous, friendly and efficient. Breakfast is way overpriced but there are plenty of choices in the area outside the hotel. The restuarant next door to the hotel is under renovations as is the outdoor rooftop deck, but that didn't effect my stay - the pool are is indoors and a wonderful spot to relax with amaziong 360 degree view of the city. The views of Central Park from this hotel are spectacular. I would definitley request a high floor with a park view. Thoroughly enjoyed our two-night stay. Terrific location, very comfortable, clean and upscale rooms. And the elevators were so much fun to ride in!\\n Very accommodating to our requests and needs. When we first arrived, we asked for a quieter room on a higher floor, which was immediately changed. There was a problem with one of the amenities (clock radio); within minutes of requesting a replacement, it was done. When we went out in the evening, we were offered additional umbrellas without even asking! When we checked out, we even had our luggage safely stored for the afternoon and evening until we could come back and pick them up.\\nWould definitely stay at Le Parker Meridien should the opportunity arise. I have always wanted to stay here and finally had the chance to. We were given an upgrade and had an amazing view of Central Park. \\nI want to mention Anastasia at the front desk. She was great and gave excellent service. She even wished us a Happy Anniversary ;-)\\nWe ate at the Burger Joint- burgers were great. Just note that this place is very popular so it was crowded but defintely worth waiting for a seat. The burger bar was fabulous if a little expensive.\\nThe room was a standard 4* with ample space and storage. I felt like they really wanted me to be there, almost like I was a star or something. I did not know that kind of attitude still existed in the industry. Love, love, love me some Le Parker Meridien. Love the orange and gray, love the modern vibe, love the location, even love the dang shampoo.\\nIts a must see and a MUST STAY! This was my third stay at LPM and as always we had a great time. If I could change anything I would not book with bargain basement rates with online travel agency ... nothing wrong with them, but having stayed this time on the cheap rather than my previous stays when I booked directly with LPM reservations, I much prefered being able to negotiate a room on the 26th floor with a park view than being given a room on the 11th with a view and sounds of a building site ... you get what you pay for! Having said that, the room was great, really comfy beds and clean bathroom. We had a problem with our loo on arrival with was dealt with super quick and accompanied by a personal apology from head of housekeeping. Special mention must go to the two gentlemen of the concierge who were unfailingly helpful and as a result of their suggestion we had the best steak meal ever! I minor niggle that I can't quite get past (but has not put me off returning!) is that getting a breakfast can be a bit stressful at the weekends, as for some reason I've never quite understood, LPM open their restaurant, Norma's, to every Tom, Dick and Harry that want to eat there, as a result LPM guests have to book well ahead for weekend breakfast and as we found, you may find you have to get up early to ring down for a cancellation. I still find it a bit bizarre to expect paying guests to eat outside the hotel while non residents fill up the breakfast tables and not something I've come across in any other hotel, but having said that the breakfast are worth the stress and we did manage to get tables when we wanted. All in all I would definitely recommend a stay here as Hotel location is just about as good as it gets, the rooms are great, the staff are courteous and nothing is too much trouble. The Knave bar was particuarly good for a late night hot chocolate. Oh and how could I forget the amazing burgers from the burger joint tucked away in the corner of reception, a hidden treat! Well done LPM and thank you! The Parker Merdian is a fantastic mid-town location. Rooms are a bit minimalistic, but in an extremely fashionable / chic manner. Staff is always extremely helpful. Views of Central Park from the high floors are great. My daughter and I stayed here while in the city visiting colleges. Centrally located, we were close to the theatre district, trains, shopping and Central Park. The concierge helped us with reservations for an incredible dinner at a restaurant I never would have discovered otherwise and cabs were at the ready. Our room was exceptionally clean and quiet. Would absolutely stay here again. We have been staying at Le Parker Meridien for years. It is our go to hotel everytime we are in the city. We stay there as a couple and as a family with our 5 year old son. The Junior Suite is the best set up. You have a bed AND a pull out couch for your little one. There is enogh space for a family to breath in the Junior Suite witch is not easy to come by in the city that never sleeps. The staff is accommodating which helps when you are ordering room service for a young child who may not like what is on the menu. The rooms are clean and always kept up to date. Something is new and refreshed each time we visit. It's great because The Buger Joint is in the lobby for a quick bite to eat. It happens to be one of the best burger places in the entire city! The location is amazing. Close to the theater, great restaurants, Central Park, and Times Square, not to mention the best shopping! If you are heading downtown, they will hail you a cab, no worries. It is always easy and a pleasure staying at Le Parker Meridien Hotel in NY. Ideal location, just around the corner from Carnegie Hall &amp; The Russian Tea Room, just steps away from the subway and few blocks from Central Park.\\nA Starbucks Coffee Shop and Dean &amp; DeLuca across the street.\\nUnder some construction, but very considerate not to begin too early or too late.\\nWe were happy to upgrade to a Junior Suite, kids had plenty of room and loved the swivel TV! Large, modern bathroom and plenty of closet space.\\nThe King size bed, mattress was fantastic and we had the best sleep ever!\\nNice to wake up to a fresh terry robe too!\\nWould book back in a New York Minute!!!! great restaurants in the hotel, great location,the hotel bar was great.make sure you make reservations at norma's restaurant in the hotel so you do not have to wait along time for your table,but it is worth the wait.I am a starwood member and i think because i was upgraded to a mini suite, it was great! Location is great - steps to subway, Dean and Deluca cafe and Starbucks across the street, a couple of blocks to Central Park, short walk to Times Square. Got a great deal on Hotwire, facilities are also good - room was a good size for Manhattan, excellent gym (although disappointing to pay $10 per visit), pool area really nice, internet connection is $16/day, so went to Starbucks for free wifi instead. Staff are overall quite nice - we arrived on a Friday at noon and since there was a room available, we were able to check in right away. Didn't try the restos, though they are talked about very positively. Overall very happy with experience and stay here. While on business in NYC I usually stay at another brand. However, I found this hotel to be quite exquisite and centrally located. Le Parker Meridien is down the road from Carnegie Hall, a couple of blocks from Central Park and very close to the subway. The lobby is impersonal and set round minimalist reception desks. There is a breakfast bar on one side and a very popular burger bar on the other side. Opening into 57th street is a long narrow bar which serves from breakfast till late, with efficient and friendly staff. There is a gym downstairs and a small swimming pool on the top floor with great views uptown. The rooms are a good size, well styled with lots of hanging space, a safe, desk, chairs and a large swivelling TV, dvd and games consol. The bed was large and comfortable. The bathrooms are reasonable size with a bath, shower, fluffy towels, a good hairdryer and an excellent makeup mirror. There is a minimal supply of toiletries - a box of tissues and one each of shampoo, conditioner and two thin soaps. Having no dressing gowns or slippers with a pool upstairs was a shame. They also have an excellent facility in the lobby to check in on line and print your boarding pass for free. Overall therefore a good value stay with friendly and helpful staff. Location is great, room is clean and tidy. Pity that they didnt offer me a suite with park view. Down side is they don't have lounge for platinum members, which means no free breakfast~~~Overrall, it's much better than other hotels in NYC, such as Westin Time Square (small and noisy...) We have just returned from a 10 day stay at Le Parker Meridien. We had originally booked a basic suite but took advantage of a suite upgrade for a small cost at check in. Our suite was spacious with a fantastic view of Central Park. The hotel is perfectly located for our family, being an easy walk to all our NYC favourites- Central Park, theatre district, Moma and 5th Avenue etc. Staff were helpful and attentive at all times. This hotel is now our NYC favourite. I took my Daughters to NYC for Spring Break and we chose Le Parker Meridien for it's location to everything within walking distance of what we wanted. The oversize twin beds are interesting but 2 children fit into them comfortably. There was construction going on during our visit so when we pulled up to the Hotel there was scaffolding out front and I do wish I would have known this or had been told when I bookd the hotel......The construction wasn't bad but it was hard to appreciate how nice the hotel inside is/was with this ugly scaffolding right out front. However, our stay was lovely and the customer service at this hotel was great!!! I would go back if I know Darius is still working there. Loved everything about it. Perfect midtown location with lots of conveniences just outside the hotel. However, never wanted to leave between the Gravity gym, room service, and cozy room. Spa set-up could benefit from upgrade/expansion and pool area is rather plain, otherwise the hotel has everything one could want. Nothing outstanding, although no red-flags either. I stayed for 3 nights for business meetings. Location is good. Check-in was efficient. Rooms are clean &amp; everything was in working order - which is absolutely critical. Some of the furnishings seemed \"cheap\" - like bed frame, curtain for closet - although not a big deal to me. Fewer amenities than many hotels (i.e. includes shampoo, conditioner, lotion, large safe &amp; umbrella- which was helpful --- does not have coffee maker, robe, body wash or Qtips/cotton balls). I didn't think noise was too bad. Like that able to print airline boarding pass for free in lobby. Didn't like that hotel food &amp; internet were very expensive - although that is consistent with other properties I've stayed at in New York. Bottom line - location is good, I haven't rated a reasonably priced New York hotel above a 3 - so compared to other comparably priced NYC hotels, this is an ok choice. I spent one night at the Parker Meridien while in NYC with my husband for a concert at Lincoln Center. The location was great - close not only to Lincoln Center but also Carnegie Hall, Central Park and Broadway. The rooms were large enough, beds very comfortable and nice Peter Thomas Roth products in the bathroom. There wasn't a coffee maker in the room, but there's a Starbucks directly across the street! Staff was very pleasant and I'd definitely stay there again. If you can afford it, I highly, highly recommend the Le Parker Meridien. In NYC, you have to be really careful, because most of the hotels are old, and as such have mold, leaky faucets, suspect carpets, horrible beds, etc. The Le Parker Meridien is completely updated, wonderfully clean, and in a terrific location to local restaurants, subway lines, Central Park, the major museums, etc. My daughter and I had a simply lovely time. great location near columbus circle; small but cozy rooms with beautiful decor. beds are a little soft but not bad. Beautiful hotel overlooking Central Park. Loved it. Great location. We had a king suite and it was very spacious. I did not eat in the restaurant but my friend had and said it was great. Would love to stay there again. I was put up here by a NYC organization that invited me to an event they were holding in the neighborhood. As my usual business travel to New York focuses on Midtown East, staying here was a chance to experience the other side of midtown Manhattan as a visitor. It's a nice area and very convenient to Central Park, Columbus Circle and subway lines that can take you quicklly and cheaply up/downtown.\\nI liked the vibe and comfort of the hotel, yet a couple of standard in-room amenities for this quality property were missing--no in-room coffeemaker and no bathrobe.\\nThe fitness club was better than average, but I had to pay $10/day to use it, even as a paying guest! Not a competitive point. We were planning to have our 16 year old daughter stay with a friend so we wouldn't have to pay for a suite for our family of four. Instead, a wonderful hostess at the front desk offered us their diplomatic suite for $200 more per night during a sold out week, what would normally go for $1500/night. Wow, what a view, what a bargain, a really nice reward for loyal guests. We'll definitely be back. I travel a lot on business and am used to being treated well. This was perfect for my husband and myself. Very nice lobby to chill out. Not noisy like a lot of W's (which I also stay) Beautiful lounge to have coffee or drink before or after show or after shopping. Excellent gym which we used on a rainy day. Norma's was expensive but worth it and it was wonderful after you digested the price that you were paying for breakfast.\\nI would choose this hotel again particularly for a weekend. I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 3 nights. I got an excellent rate for the room using Priceline. If I had paid full price for the room that I was assigned, I would have been disappointed, but since I got a deal through Priceline, I overlooked the minor asthetic problems with the room. \\nThe room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable, and the sheets were clean and crisp. The towels and wash clothes were clean, and seemed to be new. There was a large safe with a programmable combination in the closet. The furniture was in near perfect condition--no visable scratches or marks. \\nThe bathroom was large, and featured a large vanity. The faucet was so close to the back of the sink that it made it impossible to wash your hands without getting water all over the vanity. The toilet was also very low to the ground, so if you have issues getting up and down from a seated position, you may want to request a handicapped room. \\nAt some point, they must have been a leak in the room, as there were several spots on the ceiling in the bathroom and the bedroom that were painted a different shade of white. The paint on the doors was also chipped. \\nThe room was not very soundproof. The street noise was very loud (particularly the night when dumpsters at the building across the street were emptied at 2:00 a.m. the morning). I've stayed at about 20 hotels in NYC, and I've never noticed the street noise the way I did at Le Parker Meridien. While I expect some street noise when I stay in the city, I have never had it wake me up in the middle of the night like it did at Le Parker Meridien. \\nThe doors of the rooms also seemed a bit loud when they closed. I heard my neighbors doors each night when they arrived back to their room at night. \\nThe staff was pleasant and helpful. They were efficient at check-in and check-out, and the housekeeper on my floor was friendly and quick with a smile. \\nI tried the Burger Joint, and was not impressed. While the burger was good, it wasn't worth a long wait to get it (I went at an off time, and only waited about 15 minutes). The fries were not very good--the tasted like they had sat out for a while. There is not enough seating. By the time you order your burger, fries, and a drink, the price is close to what you'd pay for a meal at a place like Applebees or Chili's. \\nOverall, I enjoyed my stay. Most of the issues that I noticed with the room were very minor, and could easily be fixed with some paint. I would definitely stay here again. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It is in an excellent location within walking distance of most things you would want to see or do in NYC. Room was lovely and clean although sofa bed was a bit uncomfortable for my teenage daughter. Could not fault the staff who were professional, welcoming and polite. My two young daughters and myself were often walking back and forward from the hotel to Times Square very late at night and always felt that we were in a safe neighbourhood. This is a lovely, clean and convenient place to stay in NYC. . My wife and I spent the night of April 2nd at the Meridien and it could not have gone any better. We checked in and I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and anything special they could do would be great. Lawrence at the front desk was extremely helpful and gave us a room on the 32nd floor overlooking the park. The room was nice and clean with a lot of room for NYC. I definitely felt like I was un a luxury hotel. Unfortunately we only spent less than 24 hours in the hotel and didn't get to experience much else but everyone we did deal with was extremely helpful and I look forward to returning the next time I am in the city. Worst hotel ever. I only give it one star because I don't know how to give it a lower ranking. In general the rooms were outdated and the staff was unhelpful. Specifically, our hotel room flooded and we believe the staff stole a ring from our room (which we promptly reported). Not only did the staff fail to fix these problems but the hotel staff didn't even apologize for our terrible experience, let alone try to make it right. This place was excellent, clean and friendly. would recommend it to anyone. As for the post about bed bugs, we did not see any bed bugs or signs of bed bugs so that is not true. great place to stay! I recently traveled to NYC on business with my husband. We ended up booking at Le Parker Meridien through Hotwire and got a great rate, however we weren't quite sure what to expect once we got there. My worries were over once we stepped foot into the lobby and up to the front desk for check-in. It was such a breeze! Checking in took no longer than 5 minutes, and the front desk agent was helpful and friendly. The room was immaculately clean and well kept, as were the public spaces in the hotel. Concierge and front desk staff were amazingly helpful! Not being from the area, whenever we had questions they really took their time to help us, whether it was with directions, or food/restaurant suggestions. And not only did they help us, but they were pleasant while doing so. I would absolutely stay here again. Stayed for three days. Room was clean and well appointed. Elevators efficient. All staff we encountered were very helpul and friendly, used front desk, conceriege, housekeeping, restaurant. Everyone helpful and very cool!\\nHotel is extremely well located! Few quick blocks to theatre district and 1 block from 5th avenue and 2 blocks from the park. Great location!\\nWill definately stay again! Le Parker Meridien is an excellent hotel! The facility is beautiful and the staff is friendly, professional, and dedicated. Very clean hotel with a great staff. Norma's is a very good hotel restaurant and you just can't beat the Burger Joint behind the velvet curtain. Wonderful room layout. Service was excellent. Would return in a heart-beat! From the moment I arrived I felt welcomed especially after the reception person thanked me for returning. Everything works in the rooms and they are ALWAYS clean. I really really love staying in this hotel. I highly recommend this hotel. The gym center, the roomy guest rooms, the wonderful view of the Central Park make the diference. Perfect Location. Clean Rooms. Upgrade to Park view room with SPG Gold status. Very low last minute rate on spg.com. Room Service Quick. Excellent TV. Fantastic front desk staff (huge bonus)\\nOnly downside were the archaic hairdryer (pack your own) and no bathrobe.\\nWill chose this hotel again. Was upgraded as a SPG Platinum from a reserved Tower King Park View to a Junior Suite in the Tower with a Park View. This Junior Suite was approximately 50% larger than the Junior Suites I've previously been upgraded to when I've reserved the least expensive room (NOT the Tower King Park View) at this property.\\nRoom and bath were spotless. Room was warm but opening the windows for 10 minutes solved this issue. High-speed internet was free as part of the SPG Platinum benefits. No problems with the internet.\\nEmilie at the front desk was wonderful. Makes you feel special.\\nRoom service was quick, though they did forget the drink I ordered. It arrived about five minutes later.\\nDid video check out and stopped at front desk and retrieved a copy of my folio. About two hours later, a copy of my folio was also emailed to me. Quick check in , check out, was quite impressed with the helpful front office staff and also the knowledgable concierge. \\nGood location ( close to my office).\\nSlow breakfast at Norma's and hence could not try it. Knave has a quick croissant and coffee/tea option for those in a rush. Could not try the recommended burger place due to the long queue, and went to Angelo's pizza restaurant located opposite the hotel, which was ok. Room service took half an hour for breakfast but they had told me in advance so it was fine.\\nThe room was quite small, but adequate for a single traveller. This was my second stay at the Le Parker Meridien and it was wonderful. The staff is very helpful and they always go above and beyond to meet your needs. We called and asked for an extra wash cloth one night because the maid had only left 1 and they brought us a stack of 5! They always take it to the next level with their service.\\nThe location si also wonderful. Very close to subway stations and also close to the park and entertainment. I would definetly stay here again! This hotel is an ideal location in midtown. The front desk staff is extremely helpful! I was very pleased and impressed with Reina and how informative she was when she checked us in. However, twice during our stay we were interrupted by other staff members in unusual ways. First, a man came to our door, rang the bell and asked us if we needed mini-bar service even though we hadn't touched anything in the mini-bar. Second, on the morning before we checked out around 8:00 a.m. (check out is at noon) a member of the housekeeping staff rang the bell and woke us. \\nOverall, it was a nice place and we are still sad we didn't have a chance to try to burger place that everyone raves about, but the line fills up fast and the hotel was packed the weekend we were there so there were long waits at both the restaurant and at the bell station so we opted to not check out luggage and catch an earlier train. There was also no ATM in the hotel and the burger place only takes cash, which again, is somewhat inconvenient. I got this room for $138 via Priceline Name Your Own Price which is an insanely low price for this hotel. With that said, who am I to complain, but.... The room was pretty small even by NY standards, and the tan paneling was not that appealing. The beds were rather low to the ground albeit pretty comfortable. The TV channel selection was basic cable. I mention this because if I had paid full price I would have been a little disappointed. The location of the hotel is great- right next to Central Park and Carnegie Hall, and only a few minute walk to Times Square /Theater District. The staff was pleasant and the common areas were clean and busting with people. \\nGiven what I paid for the room I was quite happy, but if I had paid full price, I would have been a little disappointed. I love hotels with style, but staying at one usually means I have to sacrifce business friendliness and location to stay at one (I'm referring to you, W Hotels New York). Le Parker is the total package. This visit, the service was top notch...not just for New York, but compared to anywhere in the US.\\nPros: SERVICE, Burger Joint, stylish comfortable rooms, classic cartoons in the elevators.\\nCons: Restaurant noisy for breakfast meetings, taxi waits can be long, Perfect location, fantastic view of Central Park and the bed / room was very comfortable.\\n Good burgers at the Burger Joint Restaurant. We had a great time at The Parker Meridien (got it by chance through Hotwire). It's perfectly located next to Central Park and far away enough from Broadway that you don't get the noise, yet close enough that you can walk quite quickly. It's in a beautiful part of the city. Like everywhere in NYC, parking is expensive, so we saved some money by taking a commuter train in. Room was pretty big for NYC standards, and clean. We were a bit disappointed that they charge for Wi-Fi. We had our breakfast in the lobby restaurant. Was not too busy, were seated promptly. Our meals arrived cold after a very long delay. Had to ask our waiter for our food.\\n After an evening around town we would have liked to visit the bar for a nightcap, but was told it closed at 12:45. Odd for a city such as ours. Very disappointing! Also the parking is not \"free\" as implied below. Another dated New York chain hotel, needing some refurbishment of rooms. Not one of Starwood's best.....\\nWhat I liked:\\n- convenient location if you have meetings in midtown\\n- norma's....great brunch there\\n- nice lobby, i guess.....\\nWhat could be better:\\n- rooms were old and cramped, even though I had apparently a better 'corner room'. Bed and table felt outdated and cramped\\n- toilet in my room continued to make strange sounds \\n- price asked was $300 plus, for what was a 3.5/4 star room at best\\n- you look straight into office buildings when you peer out the window\\n- the 'secret' burger joint in the lobby meant there were massive lines of tourists fililng up the lobby. In my view, the burgers were not that good and the people serving them have an attitude I was traveling with one friend for a weekend in the city. The hotel staff were extremely polite and knowledgeable about things to do in Manhattan. We arrived late Friday afternoon, and heard a large amount of noise in our room. Thankfully the hotel had included a letter about construction that was currently taking place M-F 11 AM - 6 PM, and it was stopped by 6 PM. Le Parker Meridien had a very contemporary, yet relaxed vibe, and the beds were FANTASTIC! One last thing -- there is a one hundred $$ charge placed onto your credit card to reserve for any damages (Taken off after you leave). Be mindful of that, they don't tell you! Great hotel. We really enjoyed our stay. Very clean and in a great location. This may be my favorite New York Hotel. I'm thrilled Le Parker Meridien is now part of the SPG family of hotels. Great location. Close to subway, Central Park, restaurants. Service is great. Close to Time square. All within walking distance. Would stay again. A good place . . .nice ambiance, good staff. Only issue was we booked two rooms together, and when we got there found they were on diff. floor (how is that \"together\"?) so I had to straighten that out.\\nAlso--no coffee makers in the rooms. Asked for one . . . was told there were none, but I'm sure I had one last time I stayed there. Starbucks is across the street but I need a cup of jo to even think about walking across the street! Title says it all really.\\nFriendly staff at check in although there was a bit of a problem with the booking (although don't think this was the hotel's fault). The room, on the 21st floor, had city views: not even a hint of the park sadly. Room decor was simple but a bit tired and the room was a decent size for New Yor. Room furniture looked pretty cheap though. Reminded of all the fake wood stuff from the 70s. It was a very simply furnished room, no luxury here for sure. The TV (old) was in some giant rotating metal thing. Completely pointless and ugly. Would have been better off mounted on the wall. Closet space was poor: an area in the room with a curtain over it. The bathroom was better and worked well. The bed was okay: they had put in an additional down mattress on top of the traditional one which I'm sure made it more comfortable if a bit lumpy in places. \\nNo free wifi in the room which was a bit disappointing but free in the bar. Bar was shockingly expensive and by day became an espresso bar which served very nice coffee. Shame it didn't open until 0730 am. \\nMorning noise was bad due to renovations on the roof. Drilling for hours.....apparently you couldn't escape it no matter where you were due to sound travelling through the building or something. Very irritating.\\nSo at $400 a night it was NOT good. Really not worth it. Very mediocre room which may be passble at half that amount but unless you get a really good deal, I wouldn't stay here again. Ever! I stayed at this hotel for 1 night with my teen-age son. \\nAs many have previously stated, the hotel location is very convenient and the rooms are clean. I also have no complaints about hotel staff. The lobby is nice.\\nHowever, my average size room for NYC seemed dated (i.e. popcorn ceiling, oldish furniture which appeared to be on the cheap side, older model TV.) The room appointments were nothing special.\\nThe mattresses were VERY hard and VERY uncomfortable. The 2 single beds were also too low to the floor for my liking.\\nThe view of an old office building from my 19th floor room wasn't great . If you can get a room with a park view I'm guessing it might be much better.\\nI had a great online rate for the room so I guess I shouldn't complain. But all-in-all it was only an okay experience. Just didn't seem like a 4 star hotel room to me. - more like 2.5 or 3. I love W Hotels and am a big starwood fan. Almost stayed at the W Union Sq. but selected this hotel based on reviews. The room was so small (even for NY) and many things didn't function properly from the air, tv, hair dryer. The bed was not very comfortable and I cannot remember staying in a hotel where the bed wasn't good. On the plus side, the view overlooking the park was awesome and the location is great. We had cocktails at the lobby bar which is a great place to meet people for a late night gathering whether you stay at the hotel or not. This hotel has an excellent location. Room was very good,. except for the bed (Rm 3812); it was comfortable, roomy and conductive to work and relax. The hotel has only one restaurant which operates mostly as a cafeteria. It could use a better restaurant (specially during winter), but there are plenty of good restaurants in the immediate neighborhood. Love the Burger Joint in the hotel; amazing. Also great breakfast/brunch restaurant (Norma's). This hotel is excellent in it's location to everything in Manhattan. The staff was very courteous and helpful with all of my requests. The only issue is the construction at Carnegie Hall which kicked in at 7:00 AM every morning. Everything else was WONDERFUL. The staff was wonderful. They helped make a special occasion incredibly memorable. Don't forget your bathingsuit! The enclosed rooftop pool and its views are a treat! First, the positiives. Great staff. Outstanding gym.\\nBut room location was a disgrace. I had a reservation for a junior suite. That wasn't avaialble, so all I asked for was a quiet room, and after a couple of very polite requests, I ended up with a room on a lower level, directly across from the elevator. Air conditioning didn't work. And I have preferred status with Starwood. as above. great hotel in a great location-midtown manhattan, near carnegie hall, broadway, lincoln center and near a, near a subway stop.clean, spacious, functional rooms, with many nice amenities in the hotel including great breakfast restaurant (open until midafternoon), an inexpensive, good hamburger restaurant, and a nice light breakfast restaurant/bar. My family and I enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Le Parker Meridien on 56th St in NYC this past weekend. The hotel is central to what we like to do in the Big Apple - Broadway Plays, Central Park, museums and great restaurants.\\nThe pool on the Penthouse floor offered great views of Central Park!. All the staff we came in contact with were pleasant, and helpful. \\nWe'll definitely be staying at the Le Parker Meridien again. I loved my stay in Le Parker Meridian and wish that I had been there longer than one night ! There is construction going on in the front which was a bit annoying at first and once inside, you forget it because the people are there for you and for you to be comfortable and taken care of. I had a room facing Central Park which was breath-taking. Bed was very comfortable - bathroom a bit plain for this type of hotel and all of it was well attended to so that you could feel at home. \\nThe bar is exquisite - a beautiful place to hang out and the Burger Joint is unique. I stayed at Le Parker Meridian because of a Priceline bid. So I did not really choose the hotel myself. But my stay was lovely. Check in was unremarkably easy and uncomplicated. The room was quiet and extremely clean. The bed was comfortable and there were extra pillows in the room in case I wanted them (I did!). \\n The Burger restaurant off the lobby was a very casual touch in this upscale hotel. It sort of seemed to not 'fit' with the atmosphere of the hotel, but I am so very glad it was there and open late the night I arrived. The only thing I would have dreaded more than going out to eat after traveling cross country woukld have been paying room service prices :) The small coffee bar was an AMAZING place to have a morning macchiato before my appointments. \\n The only negatives I can think of - the shower cap did not fit entirely over my shoulder length hair; and the 57th street entrance was not well marked. The location is excellent. I will look forward to staying again when the upgrades on the outside are finished as the scaffording on the outside was a little distracting. Of course, it can't be helped and did not affect the inside. This was my return to this favorite hotel after an defection for a very good french hotel six month ago and the experience was incredibly excellent, confirming the reasons why I love this hotel. The unique atmosphere starts at the lobby, Norma restaurant and the cafe Nave, besides the hard to match Burger Join behind the curtain. It follows with the sensation of being living at a luxury appartment in NYC with great service and very comfortable rooms. The Concierge tips on dinning were surpringly good, for some with experience in the city. Borrom line, great place with great service along unique style. We keep coming back- Rooms are quiet, whistle-clean, elegant/minimalist with enough walk-around-the-room space; always an interesting view and the park is gorgeous all year long. Right in the middle of it all: it's a five-minute walk to just about anything (and worth the extra steps to everything else). Helpful, polite staff to point out what the locals do, and where to find it. Norma's does the room service, what a treat after a late night out! LOVE the \"Lazy Sunday checkout\" option, the cherry on top of a weekend. Spent 8 days in NYC helping my son get his apartment set up. PM was the perfect launch pad. Coffee and croissants in Knave to start the day. Drinks in Knave to recover after all the moving/assembly. Short walk for shopping. Short walk to a show. Quick ride to MSG for a hockey game. Park close by. Best ever hamburgers in the dive in the lobby (take them to go and eat in your room, otherwise you'll wait hours for a table) We have stayed at the Le Parker Meridien before and each time was delightful. The staff is helpful and delightful. When dealing with them, you feel they are genuinely interested in you. They are professional, but there's a personal charm that they all seem to have. \\nThe room is always clean and if a robe is wanted, you just ask and it's delivered. Both of us use the gym which is large and well equipped, bring head phones unless you can zone out while jogging. Afterwards we tend to switch into swim gear and head to the enclosed roof top heated pool which is available all year round. It's relaxing and has a wonderful view.\\nFor those of you who like an unbelieveaable hamburger there's almost a hidden 'hamburger joint'. If you hate lines like I do, off hours like mid-afternoon really work well. It's a very relaxed crowd, but pajamas may be pushing it. You may need to ask at the front desk for it's location the first time.\\nIf you like to walk, jog or just commune in Central Park, it's maybe a two block walk. Or if you want to see Carnegie Hall or the Russian Tea Room, they're the same block. \\nWe typically go up to see a show and for us we take a ten minute walk and stand in line for discount tickets. It's a fun experience and I keep hearing I'm very lucky as the lines for me have been about ten miuntes and the discounts are 30-50%. \\nIf you're looking for the economy hotels, this isn't for you. If you are looking value, location, cleanliness and a friendly, helpful staff, it's a good place to stay. We had tickets for Lincoln Center and dinner reservations at Gordon Ramsay @ the London, Maze. The hotel was convenient to both. We were literally two blocks through easy covered \"cut through\" lobbies in public buildings to the restaurant. It was a $4.70 cab fare to Lincoln Center. \\nThe lobby of the hotel is sleek and modern. The room keys are ridiculously long cards. Some designer thought they were cool, I guess, but they didn't fit in a pants pocket or wallet. \\nThe room was done in an early 60's retro look. Brown and orange color scheme with lots of velvet. We were upgraded to a suite so we had very spacious accommodations. My husband did not like the \"old\" look - but I didn't mind it. I knew it wasn't really old. I knew it was sylistically a \"retro\" look.\\nThe hotel is an easy walk to Carneghie Deli and Carneghie Hall. We really enjoyed our stay. I would stay there again. Comfortable beds with good pillows. Nice big shower. The main complaints were no coffee pot or ironing board in the room. We love to make our first cup of coffee in the morning to have while we are getting ready. Beautiful hotel. Great beds and pillows. For the price of the room, they should provide tea or coffee and news paper in the room. I visited the hotel from Thursday 24th to Monday 28th of February and we had a fantastic time. Time square is 5-10 walk and the 5th Avenue round the corner.\\nThe room had great views to the park and the bed was so confortable.\\nWe went to the pool everyday to relax after long walks and it was nice and hot. Don't expect to do much of swiming as it is small, but great to spend time with kids. I think there is another pool on the Spa Area but there is a charge of $10 per day.\\nGreat Hamburger place at the hotel, full of locals and the Tai next door was fantanstic. \\nIn all we had a fantastic time and we will repeat the experience at the same hotel I've stayed at a lot of NY hotels over the years. But I always ask for the Parker. When they say \"Up town, Not Uptight.\" , that's me. We stayed on a Saturday night and the hotel was quite busy. Nevertheless, we were upgraded to a 30th floor park-view room without even asking, due to our Gold SPG status. We were impressed with the lack of noise. This is one of the best all-around hotels in New York, especially if traveling with children. Luxurious but modern hotel in close proximity to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, and subway lines. One of the few Manhattan hotels with an indoor pool. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Manhattan! We stayed at the Meriden again after trying the Elysee a few times. The location is about the best you can find - either walking or subway up or downtown. You have to think a little about were you are headed before you get a taxi - maybe better to walk to 6th or 7th Avenue as opposed to picking up the cab in front of the hotel. Also search for discount parking before you use their valet - at $50/day (or part thereof) its a ripoff. The staff is always very pleasant and accommodating. This time there were no bathrobes in the room and when we called they sent them right up. The inroom amenities are somewhat lacking for a hotel of this caliber particularly the no Wi-Fi or bottled water (things that the Elysee provided at no cost). But overall we like the Meriden better for its location and its more modern rooms (the Elysee with the in room air and heat is a bit much). We will return. \\nper Had a great, if cold time, in New York. Le Parker Meredien is in a great location, set back from Central Park by just 2 streets. Choose a room from the 22nd floor up to get a view of the Park itself - ours, on the 29th floor, was glorious. The room was contempoary, practical and perfectly comfortable and clean. Only points of contention was that there was only a desk (no table) and, all hot drinkers beware, no kettle and coffee! Although we got a good deal on our holiday through Expedia, it seemed a might penny-pinching to us. The room was adequate in size and traffic noise minimised by being so high up.\\nThe pool on the top floor was warm and again had lovely scenic views. However, it was always crowded with children when we went up and was actually quite small - too small to 'swim' properly really! Never visited the gym as you had to pay $10 to use it (shame!). And you had to pay too much to use the TV Internet.\\nThe only other problem was the mini-bar, whose fridge contained pressurised sections so the hotel could charge you as soon as an item was removed. Whilst they need to make a profit, I simply wanted to store a pint of milk in the fridge which I couldn't do, as the cost of the item I would remove far exceeded the cost of the milk (huge, huge, huge, ridiculous mini-bar prices were a source of great amusement). They immediately refunded the cost of my blithely removing 3 items, but told me I could hire another fridge for $40! Slightly mean again.\\nFood in New York is expensive, more than I had expected. Food generally in the hotel was too much to consider. We ate at a restaurant once, Landmarc at the Time Warner Centre, which was delicious and (comparatively) reasonably priced. Note that my burger was $16 excluding tax and tips etc. Very tasty, great atmosphere though.\\nNote also that there really is a lot of walking in New York. Everyone says it, but it's true. Everyone we asked for help (including strangers) were extremely courteous and an assistant in the J Crew store near the Financial District couldn't have been more enthusiastic and helpful in giving us a walking route! It can be quite exhausting, especially if it's freezing.\\nThe Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Centre gave spectacular views and thank goodness it offered inside viewing areas as the galeforce, icy wind was too much for me to cope with! Lobby of the Chrysler Building and Empire State were good too. Lots of UK shops in NY too - surprised by how many actually. The Statue of Liberty was great - remember to book tickets to the Crown well in advance if you want to go all the way up, otherwise you'll only get to the top of the pedestal. Liked the quieter street rather than avenue location of this hotel. Peaceful nights despite construction outside our window. So convenient for walking around Manhattan! The service was excellent and we got our money's worth. I thought all aspect of my stay was great. The only thing that i thought could be improved was the quality of the bed linen. It could be improved I was in town for a wedding and really enjoyed my stay at Le Parker Meridien. My room was clean, comfortable and quiet, and very modern. The hotel is very well located, easily accessible to 5th Avenue, the subway, all the tourist stuff, Times Square, restaurants, etc. Central Park is just a couple blocks away, so I was easily able to go for a great morning run. Plus, there are several coffee shops/delis around, which is great for quick, cheap(er) meals. We did have cocktails at the Nave bar one night, which was great for people watching. I would stay here again. The staff is excellent...........every time! We love the location, Norma's, and the lobby bar, I think it's relatively a recent addition. Sometimes it's a bit noisy at night; could be if construction is going on nearby. We hope to be back soon! Heads up, a $100/night deposit will be charged to your credit card. I wish check-in had explained that. Instead I got a shock when I checked my credit card balance. One phone call to the front desk later, it was resolved but I was plenty worried.\\nOther than that, come for the food. Norma' s and the Burger Joint are excellent. In such a lovely public space for the ground floor I wa surprised to have a cloth curtain for a closet door. Yet the ability to turn the tv was creative; and the long desk enabled lots of uses for that counter. But the service in every way was so unobtrusive and yet always ready to be helpful! However, when I asked for the business center I was guided to the cmputer for boarding passes - which would have cost extra $$ to use. No idea if wifi exists. Rooms are nice size. Staff is great. I still can't believe that upscale hotels in NYC don't offer free wifi, that is a miss on their part My wife was traveling to NYC to sing at Carnegie Hall (which is right next door to Le Parker Meridien). Her room was being paid for by the organization she was traveling with but mine was not. The Reservations Manager, AnnMarie Lockmeyer, went above and beyond to offer me the same group rate as the organization my wife was traveling with. Even if I had paid the full room rate I would have been extreamly satisfied with my stay...but saving a few bucks doesn't hurt. Thank you Le Parker Meridien...you will have my buisness next time I come to NYC, whether it's business or pleasure.\\nJason I know in NYC, location is everything but you kinda expect more especially when you upgrade to a suite. \\nThe Pros: The location is ideal especially if you plan on watching a show in broadway or checking out MoMa. There's a Starbucks right across, and a Duane Reade on the next block. It also has a burger joint at the ground level which serves good burgers. \\nThe suite we had was very spacious and the layout is nice especially if you're expecting visitors as privacy of the bedroom is maintained. \\nThe Cons: You need to pay for amenities when in other hotels it's free. There's no complimentary water, no free wifi or LAN internet access, there's no coffee machine (but the room service delivers coffee 24 hours), there's a mini-bar but it doesn't function as a personal ref. The suite we stayed in had no bathtub. Everything you would hope for. Very relaxing. Street noise is only drawback, so ask for an upper floor. Almost excellent. Construction outside windows facing North are no fun, but that's not the hotel's fault. I'm a stickler for coffee pots in the room and think every hotel room on the planet should have one. (I'll pay as i do for items in the mini-bar in the room) Great revenue opportunity for all the hotels. The reason it wasn't excellent (amazingly) was Norma's for breakfast. The world's best breakfast menu, the world's highest priced breakfast, and the duck confit hash was awful. Last night's duck for sure, and a melange of other leftovers that was just sad. Anyone can make great french toast. make a great duck hash, and I'm all-in.\\nMaybe the menu is too ambitious. Cut it back and do everything well. That said, it's a world-class hotel, and the cartoons in the elevator are worth the stay. I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for a work trip. I usually stay at the W in Times Square, but I decided to try something new since I would be in town almost a week. Overall, I had a very nice experience. \\nBe sure to get a room with a park view if you can. The rates are a little bit pricey, but that is to be expected in mid-town Manhattan. Normas is great for breakfast or brunch and the Burger Joint is a nice surpise. Overall, the hotel service was wonderful (even if a bit pretentious). I stayed six nights and only had only one negative experience when the waiter at Norma's barely spoke two words to me. The gravity gym is AWESOME compared to the usual hotel gyms. There is a $10 day-use fee for the gym but I thought it was worth it. The television in my room was awful (bad picture/clicking and popping sounds). This did not bother me so much, but I would have thought this hotel would have had better televisions in it. My seventeen year old daughter and I went with several other moms and daughters to New York to search for colleges. This hotel is in a good location. It was close to shopping, subway stations, great restaurants, and taxi service. We walked to the theatre district and all over the city from the hotel. The concierge was very helpful with dinner suggestions and made several reservations for us at great places. The bar was quaint and the service was great. The burger joint at the hotel was yummy!! I met the manager and he was very nice and I would definitely stay there again. Thanks to Urban Daddy,I picked up a special for my husband as a Valentine's surprise.We made the decision to stay over and it was great. As stated,service and staff were phenominal. The view of the park is fantastic and room service was prompt. The rooms were a nice size but definitely could use a makeover as it was a bit dated. The room could use an I Pod docking station as well.Try the chocolate covered strawberries! The lobby bar is amazing. I stayed in this hotel in December of 2010 and again in February as I traveled to NYC for Fashion Week. I love the location and it offers a nice energy level without feeling chaotic or like it is trying too hard. Norma's is an absolute must and the perfect way to start each day. We picked the hotel for a mixed use business and leisure trip. The hotel was ideally situated for our business meeting, but the location for after the business was even better. Walk to central park, dinning, entertainment was all perfect. We stayed in a junior suite that we were very impressed with both in size and quality for NYC! We are looking forward to returning when we have more time in town! The staff was amazing. The rooms were well appointed. It is located in the middle of everything/place you could possibly want to do/see. The price is quite competitive considering the comp set and well worth every penny. The staff is very friendly and willing to assist.The rooms are neat,clean with ample space.The location could not be better.We walked to many places for eating and entertainment.I have stayed at this hotel before and plan to return. This was an absolutely fabulous hotel experience. The staff were super attentive and friendly. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The gym was amazing. The restaurant, Norma's was incredible (I probably put on a kilo per meal, but who's counting?). The location is right in the middle of everything.\\nI really would find it difficult to fault the place - the only thing I could think of would be that I think the gym should be free for hotel guests, and probably free wifi too. But beyond that I was extremely happy in every way. I'll be back, without a doubt! A truly awesome place to stay for my first time in the city. Walking distance to most Manhattan hotspots and views of Central Park, while all the while being affordable for the budget traveler. The staff was very courteous and helpful and the room service was prompt and delicious. A very good traveling experience. The quality of the service was superb...the food was excellent...the recommendations from staff were spot-on...the room was quiet, well-regulated temperature both air and shower water...we were very happy we were able to upgrade to a junior suite at a higher level at a nominal additional fee suggested by the check-in staff...the quiet room was surprising since we were in the heart of Manhattan, we expected more noise in the halls and from the street below, but non-existent! The Burger Joint was a perfect stop after check-in for a quick bite and the bar was a great place to unwind after dinner and a show...and also great in the morning for french press coffee and a croissant while waiting for a table at the world-class breakfast served at Norma's! The OJ and fresh-squeezed grapefruit at breakfast was unbelievably good! Well If there is one person in this city who should be training front desk employees on how to do a job it should be Michael. Most hotels ask you for ID and Credit card and then send you on your way like you are a number. Michael actually took the time and asked what i was in town for? Wow the idea that someone actually cared to ask me that was remarkable in itself. When i told him how i'll be in the hotel for 10 days for work he helped me so much to get the best available room possible for my extended stay. \\nI always stay at this hotel in NYC. The Food is the best, the gym is the best, the staff are great, the pool is amazing, the views are amazing, the location is amazing, the soaps in the shower are great....the herman miller desk chairs are awesome too...\\nThis review would not be taken seriously if i didn't point out a few flaws....So i will...\\n1) Its time to upgrade the bedside alarm clocks to have ipod/iphone connectors\\n2) please put coffee in the room too!\\nThis place is really great. Thanks for being so nice to your guests. my wife and i were in the city for a wine and food tasting. we are loyal starwood hotel members and wanted to try something new. so we booked in at le parker meridien. we stayed over one night. check in and check out were great - both took a minimal amount of time and the gentleman working the desk was personable, friendly and accommodating. \\nwe were very pleased to find the room very clean and modern. we have been concerned about staying at hotels in the nyc area because of all the bedbug reports. but our room was exceptionally clean and after a quick inspection we declared the bed worthy of sleeping in. indeed, we had no problems. my only qualm with the room is that there was a tub instead of a shower stall. and the shower head seemed a bit dated. but that is me being really nit-picky. as the room and bathroom were both modern, very clean and quite acceptable.\\nwe didn't make use of the gym or hotel food services (although both looked fantastic - especially the gym, not your average hotel gym).\\nall in all - a great stay at a great hotel. Perfect, noiseless sleep. The view on the hotel backyard was not nice, but at least it was completely noiseless. I was lucky to get a high floor (22) and to have a nice quiet night. Rooms are airy and modern. Nice, firm bed. Great location. What's not to like? The hotel was nice. I was fortunate to get upgraded to a junior suite or I probably wouldn't have been happy with the room size. Bar drinks run 20-22 dollars each. Room service food was \"fair\". Breakfast for 1 was $50. I liked this hotel. The rooms were modern and clean. The bathroom was small but OK. The one downside for me was the lack of coffe maker in the room. Room service charged a $5 delivery fee plus 16% gratuity which made a small pot of coffee $16. The upside is that there is a Strbucks right across the street. I was there during a blizzard. Flights were cancelled and we were afraid we would not have a room. The Parker not only allowed us to keep our room but when we were able to get out a day earlier than planned they did not charge us the late cancellation fee (which is their policy) due to the extenuating circumstances. nice. Stayed here recently for a weekend getaway. Check-in was prompt and efficient. We were able to check in even though it was only 10:30am, which was a huge convenience. Room was clean and comfortable and had a view of Central Park. Modern decor, which isn't my wife's favorite, but I don't mind. While unpacking was surprised there was not one drawer in the room. Two decent sized closets with plenty of hangars, but no drawers to store socks, t-shirts and other small items. Shelf in closet worked for a two night stay but would be inconvenient for longer. There is a decent sized work table with phone, great Aeron chair and good lighting. Couldn't connect with the wired internet, and front desk wasn't much help, but wifi worked fine, although $17 per 24 hours. When going to bed noticed there were no black-out curtains. When checking out I inquired and was told there was a control next to the window. It must have been well hidden and the curtains very well hidden as they were not to be seen. We've always enjoyed the Parker-Meridien, for its lovely rooms, for its central location, but mainly for the burger joint in the lobby (great food!), for the rooftop pool, and for breakfast at Norma's, always interesting and delicious. We do not like the policy of charging for internet access ($17! I think - I don't buy on principle). Very nice hotel having stayed here before. But you have no access to the thermostat and the room was ice cold! I slept the first night with my winter jacket on, since there was no extra blanket available either. Upon check in we were informed there would be no running water for the next hour, that was disappointing. Also, we booked through expedia one month before, then right before we left we checked the rates at the hotel itself and found it to be almost half the price we paid. It took many, many phone calls and over an hour of our time but we were able to get the price reduced although not as low as it could have gone. Too bad! We've stayed at Le Parker Meridien several times and always enjoy every moment of our stay. It is perfectly located within easy walking distance of 5th Ave., Carnegie Hall, the Time-Warner Center and Central Park and is close by to plenty of good shops and restaurants.\\nBut it is the hotel itself that brings us back and first of all you have to acknowledge that the staff are, in our experience, unfailingly polite, courteous, and helpful. We particularly have to commend and say a very big \"Thank You\" to Maria and the entire Concierge team who spent as much time as we needed helping us sort out revised travel plans in the difficult days after the Boxing Day blizzard hit the city. We cannot think that any finer Concierge desk operates at any New York hotel.\\nThe modern rooms are pleasant and well furnished and the beds superbly comfortable being sizeable and having very fine linen. Try and get a high room with a Park view. Housekeeping is spot on.\\nAnd please be advised - until you've eaten breakfast or brunch in Norma's (you'll need to book ahead) after a swim in the superb pool at the top of the hotel then you have not done justice to your New York experience.\\nWe can't imagine staying anywhere else in NYC. I can hardly say enough about Le Parker Meridien. Yes, it is pricey. Yes the drinks in Nave are $12. But this is without a doubt the finest hotel experience I've had in New York and one of the finest I've had in the world. Call, reserve, stay. Ask for a room above the 35th floor facing Central Park. Ask anyone at the hotel for anything you need, and you'll get it post haste.\\nIn a service industry sadly devoid of great service, Le Parker Meridien is a wonderful exception. The location of this hotel is ideal. Two blocks to Central Park, 7 blocks to Lincoln Center. Excellent breakfast at Norma's in the lobby. We were upgraded to a room with a view of the Park. Magnificent. Room Service and housekeeping were quick. Room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. i would highly recommend and I will definitely return. Recently needed to attend a business meeting in NY - booked at Meridien for the rewards points. But was pleasantly surprised at the total experience - (apart from slow elevators), the experience (from the great room, top notch toiletries, view of central park, excellent breakfast in the restaurant, amazing burger in the secret burger dive) was first rate. Can't wait to go back. Arriving in NYC with great mounds of snow making traffic one great snarl, we entered the lobby a bit frazzled only to find half a dozen luggage carts blocking our way to reception. Just as I was mentally calculating how many hours it would be till we got into our room, a young man appeared at my elbow and escorted me directly to smiling Emilie at the desk who continued to erase my anxiety. With only a few words exchanged, she'd quickly agreed to my request for something \"high\" by offering an upgrade to a Central Park view for a nominal additional fee. A minute later we were on our way to the 37th floor, and suddenly we were entering our sleek, spacious room with a dead-on view of the park. What can I say? It was nothing short of stunning, and we were even more in love with Le Parker Meridien. Lots of cool features in the room: massive, comfortable bed with individual reading lights, the bathroom ( with tub!) with its Peter Thomas Roth amenities, a wonderful rooftop pool 4 flights up, Norma's, the Burger Joint and the Knave for all our dining needs an elevator ride away. No matter where we ventured in the hotel, we were met with warm smiles from helpful staff. We loved it. Wish we could have stayed longer. Would definitely return! This is a very nice hotel. The room was pretty small... it has a very good restaurant downstairs and I heard the burger place is amazing although the line was so long I did not get to try it. \\nIt is close to many attractions. Honestly, theres nothing to go crazy about if youre paying 500$ a night! The service was wonderful at the Le Parker Meridien. The staff was amazing at the business meeting, the area was keep clean and the food was fresh. The only problem I encountered was a lack of cell phone service in my room, I had to go to the lobby to use my cell phone. Quick check in/out, responsive concierge, comfortable bed, fine selection of pillows, thick towels, efficient thermal control, spacious room, functional bathroom, clean, quiet, swimming pool overlooking Manhattan, great breakfast at Norma’s, fantastic room service, gorgeous lobby bar, friendly staff, and most importantly: location...location. In this super expensive city, Parker Medidien stnads out for it's value for money. Perfect location; remarkably spacious rooms; Norma's is indeed the best brunch in town and the Burger Joint is a fun spot with excellent hamburgers, fries and milkshakes (or Sam Adams if you prefer). The doormen and bellmen have been on staff for years, and they have an amazing ability to remember guests and make them feel like they are being welcomoed home every time they return. I love the health club and the rooftop (four season) swimming pool. Location is good (depending on your plans), but overall I was very disappointed in this hotel. I expected cleaner, more amenities, a more comfortable bed, a better TV, etc.... more like what you'd expect from a higher end Starwood chain. Instead, the TV was old with poor reception, the bed was very uncomfortable, the AC/heat controls didn't work, everything seemed a bit dingy, had to pay to use the fitness center, and if you wanted to actually look in the mirror as you blow dried your hair, you couldn't since the hotel had what I consider the cheap way out by having the blow dryer stuck to the wall (and the mirror wasn't positioned close to it). All in all, wouldn't stay here again-- especially considering the thousands of other choices in NYC. Very large rooms for New York hotels. Service very good and friendly. Ideal slocation on 57th/56th and 7th Avenue. Could walk anywhere and we did. Would return again to same hotel next time. Would like to see tea and coffee facilities inroom though. Would be nice to be able to make a drink when you wake up in the morning. Can't beat the location and the hotel has a great hip vibe. Managed to check-in at 7 am (got in on a red eye) as a room was available. Concierge was also great - tried to score us reservations at babbo but of course, he's no magician! But he tried. BUT we had issues with our TV reception - it was like watching snow, after a while, I wanted to throw up. We called three times and each time they said someone was \"coming right up\" but no one ever showed. We never got our TV to work during our weekend stay. You will ask where you are, as the hotel is luxurious and with an european feel to it. There is a feeling of coziness not familiar to most hotels. The smiling faces and friendliness of staff make you feel right at home. The suite was comfortable, peaceful and well attended. Room service is the best and staff are very kind and friendly, and the food is well prepared, presented, and delicious. I consider Le Parker Meridien to be my home-away-from- home in New York City. we loved the friendly staff and the comfortable room. it's nice to have nice amenities and a comfy bed. lots of closet space too. we will be back! My two daughters (22 and 18) and I stayed here for 4 nights (26-30 Oct 2010). We’d asked for two adjoining or interconnecting rooms. On our first night we were put on two different floors! After a little insistence, the guys at the front desk did a bit of shuffling about with their bookings and managed to get us two interconnecting rooms on the 17th floor, which was more than satisfactory. So they get Brownie points; but why weren’t we given that in the first place, as we’d made our booking weeks in advance?\\nI would generally concur with most of the points made by other reviewers: it’s quite a good hotel, but lacks that ‘extra something’ which makes a good hotel excellent; and for the price, I would expect something a bit better. \\nOn the plus side: service was generally good, polite and attentive, even though the hotel was evidently very busy (in fact – we were told – full). The location is good: Subway station next door; very easy to get to shops (especially important with young daughters!); within a stone’s throw of Central Park and the “Museum Mile”; and right next to Carnegie Hall. \\nRooms are generally well appointed, and quite a good size for New York. Bathrooms a bit pokey though, and need sprucing up (cracked tiles, loose fitments etc). Beds perfectly comfortable and spacious. Old fashioned TVs in rooms (though quite serviceable). Wi-Fi in room over $16 a day (at these prices, that should be included in rate). Very expensive and touch-sensitive mini-bar: just remove a bottle from the shelf and you’ll be charged for it, even if you put it back unopened. At least the guy on the front desk warned us about this – and even advised us to buy our own drinks from the nearby store (I won’t name him, the hotel would probably sack him!).\\nAnd the minus side? One major gripe we had was that residents evidently do not get priority for breakfast. The hotel is open to non-residents for breakfast, and we were told we had to wait 25 minutes for a table, since we had no reservation! I have NEVER had to reserve a table for breakfast at a hotel where I was a guest. That’s quite unacceptable. We only had breakfast there once (it was not included in the room price – why not?); and though it was good, it was expensive (reckon on nearly $100 for three). You can breakfast for less than half that price – maybe not as refined an experience, but more than satisfying – at the various delis within yards of the hotel front door. The Carnegie Deli on 7th Ave / 55th St is particularly good. \\nThe swimming pool was a disappointment – small and crowded, so we decided against swimming there in the end. NB if you want a sauna after your swim, you have to go all the way from the 41st floor where the pool is, to the lower basement (two changes of lift) where the gym is, and pay a $10 ‘access fee’.\\nThe bar at the hotel is a long corridor leading out to the 57th St entrance on the other side of the building: it has unpleasantly loud music and never any room to sit. There is no restaurant at the hotel apart from the burger joint, which is much as described by other reviewers: incongruously (and self-consciously) a spit-and-sawdust affair hidden away from the marble columns of the hotel reception by a large curtain (felt a bit like going into a strip-joint!); heaving with people queuing at the steaming kitchen bar where you place your order; burgers served à la McDonalds in paper bags to be eaten with fingers at the wooden tables (assuming you can find a seat). But, having said that, truly wonderful burgers that McDonalds would fail to comprehend.\\nWhile I can’t say the Parker Meridien is a bad hotel, it doesn’t compare very favourably even with other Meridien hotels I have stayed in (such as the Meridien Kuala Lumpur, which is outstanding). It is not cheap, and for the price, I would expect something better and a bit more classy – it evidently caters for a possibly uncritical business clientele, given the number of corporate functions that seemed to be going on when we were there; and I suspect relies on this ‘package’ trade to keep it going rather than paying attention to the needs of individual travellers and families.\\nOverall, I think there are better places in New York for the money. My husband and I recently stayed at the Le Parker Meridian hotel when we got married in New York on New Years Eve 2010. As we were getting married (up the Empire State Building) there was so much to organise but our concierge Maria Bortoluzzi was fantastically helpful. Our room (a Junior Suite) was extremely spacious and comfortable and even though we had arrived at the height of the recent snow blizzard the service was brilliant. We had our reception at a local restaurant (Benoits - very very nice) then had cake and champagne in the Nave bar at Le Parker and all the staff were very helpful and friendly. if there was one thing against this hotel I would say that the food and especially the drinks were quite expensive but probably on a par with top class New York hotels. Woud definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a classy stay and New York is an amazine city....will definitely visit again. We chose this hotel from a brochure by our tour operator &amp; were simply blown away by the helpfulness of the staff. Front desk helped with where to stand on New Years Eve, concierge sorted out our errant shuttle service &amp; the bar staff made us feel very valued.\\nLocation was so close to everything. The cartoons in the lift were the finishing touch for both my daughter &amp; my husband! Everyone was very nice and helpful\\nRoom and bathroom decent size for NYC - Very nice restaurants: both Norma's for upscale breakfast / brunch, and the beautiful \"corridor\" for breakfast\\n- Nice and clean rooms Courteous service\\nGreat mid-town location\\nBest breakfast in town\\nReasonable NYC hotel rates\\nUnbeatable shower-power Staff is incredibly friendly. Quiet, beautiful views. Very comfortable stay. This is a nice quiet spot with very friendly and attentive staff. The concierge desk was the most helpful I think I've encountered outside a resort (I believe the person that helped us during our stay was Michael). The rooms are clean and comfortable and spacious and there's really strong pressure in the shower which I always appreciate.\\nIt's a short walk to the south end of Central Park and not very far to get to Times Square. And Starbucks at both the 56 &amp; 57 Street entrances. \\nWe loved this spot. FANTASTIC. I live in hotels and as a Starwood Platinum member I make a conscious effort to stay at their properties in order to benefit from the pampering \"most\" hotels offer. After walking out from a prepaid rate at the new Element times square (don't stay there), my family and I along with friends and their family checked into the Parker Meridien. We were both upgraded to Junior suites, the largest I have seen in NYC. Although it has probably been a decade since the rooms were last renovated, they are still modern, clean and up to date. I have stayed at much more luxurious hotels and enjoyed them as well, but this still just felt right. In a city of small rooms and service with an attitude, the Parker Meridien shines. \\nThe hotel is a home away from home offering so much more than just a room. Friendly courteous staff from the front desk to housekeeping, a pool with an incredible view, good food for a reasonable price (try the burger joint) and a spectacular gym (which I should have used)! Peter Thomas Roth toiletries ( I love that they probably chose these because the font is the same as Le Meridien's), and very witty branding. Instead of getting pissed off that it was an electronic minibar and couldn't be used as a fridge, I laughed at the memo attached as I did with all of their marketing material. \\nI am a perfectionist and find problems with hotels everywhere I stay. I can honestly say I walked out of this property feeling refreshed and happy with the feeling of money well spent. Le Parker Meridien is my new hotel of choice in the big apple! A warm welcome, great room, incredible service and excellent location... Central Park just a few minutes away, what else? We traveled to NYC for a rare weekend away with no business obligations on our itinerary. Had a terrific experience at Le Parker Meridien, beginning with a very welcoming experience checking in. Booked a junior suite with park view using Starwood points, then I inquired about upgrade possibilities at check in. Decided to pay to upgrade to a Diplomatic Suite. Outstanding, very spacious room on the 34th floor with a partial view of Central Park and a partial view of the mid-town skyline. Oversized bathroom off the bedroom plus another full bath off the dining room. Very clean. Very large living and dining area where the views were. Hotel room had a different look and feel than some we stay in (lighter wood/more modern feel). We were skeptical about what looked like a futon bed but it was surprisingly comfortable. \\nHighly recommend \"Norma's\" restaurant for breakfast. Extensive, creative, fun menu and of course, pricey, but it's NY. Long wait for a table but we called down ahead and they fit us in ahead of non-guests. Our food tasted great and service was attentive despite the frenzy.\\nHotel is in a great location if you want to be near the park but not pay to stay right on it. Easy walking access to all sorts of places, restaurants, etc. Can't wait to return! Recently stayed here Thurs-Sun, one of the better hotels in NYC. If you are expecting curt NYC staff and small dingy rooms, get ready to be surprised!! The rooms are spacious and the furniture is put in to maximize the space usage, while leaving room to move. The staff is very attentive, friendly and always smiling. All my requests were attended to within minutes - great service makes everything else better! From the moment we arrived weary from a 17.5 hour flight, we were greeted warmly. The staff were supremely helpful. There are many hotels in New York, but the Le Parker Meridien excels in customer service. We arrived 2 days after a blizzard, a 3 hour delayed flight and after having waited 2 and a half hours at JFK for our bags and still the front desk team made us feel relaxed and at home the minute we walked in the door. The location of the hotel is perfect and the concierge team were terrific. This trip was for pleasure but I would stay there for business too. Our first visit to New York and we could not have asked for a better location, 2 mins from Central Park, 10 mins from Times Square and 5 mins from the shops of 5th Avenue. On arrival we were a little concerned about the scaffolding which was decorating the front of the Hotel but a very impressive interior awaited with lovely rooms and an great atmosphere. The Hotel was very clean and well presented, the Staff were very helpful and we would definitely stay there again. So I'm here, right this minute, and no problems AT ALL.\\nThe front of the hotel is under renovation, which was slightly awkward, but the hotel itself is great.\\nFront desk personnel were very friendly to the point of recommending places to go, concierges have both been very helpful with shows &amp; places to eat, the bar/coffee place is great, the gym is amazing.\\nWe're in a Jnr Suite, upgraded at no fee against a 12k points reservation.\\nGreat room - she is from NYC and says this is a great hotel and a great room.\\nSpacious, nice, comfourtable, and - similar to the Parker in PalmSprings - really top notch toiletries.\\nNone of the listed problems with heater or A/C.\\nAs far as my experience goes, this place has gotten a bum rap.\\nI'd stay here again, and would recommend it to others. The PM Hotel is in a central location and it's perfect if you want to visit new york and enjoy the end of the year in famous Time Square. The rooms are very comfortable and full equipped . \\nJust the wireless Lan was not free and a little bit expensive (16 dollars for day). \\nIn the lobby of the hotel there is a very nice pub that makes very good hamburger. Someone says that the hamburger served in that pub is fifth best hamburger of new York. \\nUnfortunately I was not in the swimming pull on the top of the hotel. Great hotel, staff efficient and quick... love the bar and the rooms are huge for NYC!!! I very much appreciated the personal service and the warm welcome that we received from all employees. The hotel is physically beautiful, particularly the lobby and bar area. The rooms are interesting, well-appointed and very comfortable. Service was, overally, simply outstanding. From the moment we walked into the hotel the staff was courteous and professional. Reina at the front desk understood we were tired and hungry from our long trip and got us set up quickly and made some great restaurant suggestions nearby. The rooms were very nice and quite large, very modern and nice bathroom cool hip furniture. The hidden surprise was the Burger Joint located in the hotel. Great food and completely different atmosphere than the rest of the hotel. Always a line there for a reason. This was our first time staying at the Le Parker. The staff was helpful and curtious, the room was delightful all at a great price. The Burger Joint was a totally unexpected awesome eatery! After staying at the LPM, New York for the past three months, I feel compelled to provide an update. \\nLocation: Great! Close to Central Park, Columbus Circle, not in Times Square but close enough to walk, great shopping in the area, etc... Close to the Theatre District and Carnegie Hall.\\nFront Desk &amp; Bell Staff: Consistent, courteous, and very helpful. They have a multi-lingual staff (observed Japanese and Spanish speaking). I noticed the staff exercising extreme patience and care with foreign visitors.. Kudos to the Front Desk!\\nFood: Room Service is great, and they deliver the food in a timely (as in still warm) manner. The Burger Joint is a \"good\" burger, not the best I have had (i.e. Port-of-Call in New Orleans). However, if you get the crave, this place delivers the goods.\\nNorma's, is expensive! I treated my two 13 year old nieces to breakfast, and it was @ $99.. I went back for the pancakes by myself, and they were tasty. This is a great breakfast restaurant, sans the prices.\\nFitness Centre: Spacious, plenty of machines and weights plus programmable work-outs, free towels, fruit, and a pleasant staff.. I joined Boom Fitness because it is across from my place of employment, but spend more time at Gravity than Boom. If you are a Starwood Platinum, the cost is free..else $10. Olympic size pool included! One word sums up Gravity Fitness Centre: Awesome! \\nInternet: For a fee unless you are Starwood Platinum. Internet speed is \"Ok to Good\" but not the best I have experienced in NYC. \\nI only have one complaint -- According to SPG policies, a Platinum Member should receive complimentary Upgrades when available. Over the past month, there have been Jr. Suite Upgrades available, but they were not offered to me even when requested. This is frustrating as they hold the rooms for Customers who pay the extra $$$ for the price of the rooms. Since I am both a Platinum Member and loyal long-term Customer it would \"seem\" to be good business to offer the Upgrades to someone who stays at the hotel on a week-to-week basis vs. someone there for a few days. Also, I travel with music equipment and the extra room is necessity for me... \\nOverall, I still prefer LPM above the other area Hotels (including comparable 5 star locations). I have been in NYC for one year and tried different hotels in Mid-Town, Down-Town, and Chelsea (including other Starwood properties).You cannot go wrong with this place! Had much trepidation after reading the nasty stuff herein, but just got back from a two night stay during the NYC Blizzard of 2010...highly recommended hotel!\\nWe have stayed here for two nights after Xmas as our \"family treat\" every year for 5 years, and once again this is our favorite place in NYC! Perfect location and great accomodations. None of the issues aforementioned.\\nI booked an offered upgrade to a Jr Suite for us and had a separate park view King room for kids, both on the 25th floor. Both were well-maintained and very nice rooms...no complaints! I am beginning to wonder if there is a concerted effrot to dis this hotel!?\\nStaff was uniformly friendly and the bathrooms were spotless. Great fun for the entire \"crew!\"\\nAlready planning our stay for next year! We love it here - from when we check in to when we check out. Michael takes great care of us at the front desk. We always love the rooms he gives us, and Bob is our favorite waiter at Norma's, both who remember us each time we come. That feels great. GREAT location. This hotel always seems to get mixed reviews and when looking on trip adviser you will probably think great hotel or oh gosh what have I done! \\nWe stayed here around the same time last year and due to the fab location thought we would give it a try again on a trip to NYC with my husbands mum. I'm glad we chose this hotel again as she loved her room overlooking the park and also knave which she said had the best coffee, not being a coffee drinker I couldn't say but the atmosphere in knave was really nice. \\nWe also had a room overlooking the park which was lovely, personally I think the rooms are nice they are quite roomy which I understand is a bit of a treat in nyc. I admit that the TV's should be updated to flat screens but then you don't come to nyc to watch tv! \\nAlso beware of the fridge if you touch this you will be charged we never used it on either trip but it is worth noting from previous reviews. \\nWhile staying at this hotel we went to Normas and I had their amazing blueberry pancakes which were very good, hubby had the breakfast basket which he seemed to enjoy. The staff in Normas also ask if you would like orange juice, which is some of the best orange juice I have ever had but beware it costs $9 a glass worth it but a bit of a shock if your on a budget.\\nWe also went to the burger joint as well which was really good too but could be considered pricey compared to the no of burger joints available in nyc but would recommend you try if you get the chance and the staff in there are lovely. \\nThe only things I would change about this hotel would be that they should have free wifi as you have to pay for this and in most hotels free wifi comes as standard. Also I'm not overly keen on the cartoons in the elevator I personally would like to have something else on maybe a news channel instead. \\nOverall I think this is a really good hotel and would recommend a stay at Le Parker. The staff was friendly and helpful, hotel is cozy and comfortable. It is in walking distance of of many majoer attractions, not to mention being next door to Carnegie Hall. I hope to stay there again on my next visit t o New York. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the view from the pool deck is awesome. I had a great experience here. I received excellent service at check-in and check-out. I arrived at about 9 am and didn't expect to get a room until after 3 pm, but the person who checked me in found me a great room that was ready by about 10 am. The room was a good size by any standard, had a great TV, a large desk and chair, and a huge window. The closet was a bit tiny, but that was a minor thing for me. The bathroom was modern, had plenty of mirrors, and plenty of hot water with great water pressure. The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept great both nights. Even on the 37th floor, I could hear the city below, but it's New York and noise is part of it. The lobby and waiting areas were modern with plenty of places to sit and people-watch. It had a beautiful Christmas tree, too. The concierge was friendly and helpful. Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and welcoming. My favorite part of staying there was hanging out at Knave at night. It has great coffee, great drinks, and great sandwiches and cookies. Their famous mocha lives up to its reputation! The ambiance and atmosphere is very chic, with high ceilings, comfortable couches and chairs with red accents. It's lit with low-light and candles, which adds to the sophisticated feel. I hung out there two nights in a row and planned to read, but found that I enjoyed watching the people and talking to other patrons more so I hardly read at all. It is also located in a great part of Manhattan, a couple of blocks from Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center, and an easy walk to Times Square and the theater district. Overall, I had a great experience and look forward to coming back soon. My daughter and I stayed here for five nights in November. Our room\\nwas amazing. It was twice as large as any hotel we had stayed at in\\nNYC. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Very close to Central\\nPark and 5th Avenue shopping. A really great location and a great\\nplace to stay! Driving into the city and leaving the car at the door of the Parker Meridien could not have been easier. This was my first time, and the staff was welcoming and efficient. Check in was a breeze, and the same was true leaving, when the car was produced with less than a five minute wait. I look forward to returning. I have very High expectations in Hotel rooms... &amp; am VERY picky about cleanliness .I can honestly say, that this was one of the top 5 hotels Ive stayed in.. The staff was Great.. Very friendly &amp; accommodating... The location is perfect.. We walked to Time square, Radio City &amp; Rockefeller center in minutes.. The subway is convenient as well. The room was clean &amp; the bed was VERY comfortable.. Its a great place to stay with families.. They give the kids Coloring books &amp; crayons upon check in.. They have a 20ft Wii that my littles guys loved...The Burger Joint was yummy! The pool was a great retreat for the kids when it was raining.. The room was fairly large for NYC.. We stayed in the Jr Suite.. definitely recommended for families\\nDont let some of the poor reviews below steer you away... Im sure glad I didn't! We had a WONDERFUL time.. Thanks Le Parker Meridian! My wife and I stayed there Monday night. The room was small but comfortable and the TV was aged and made a crackling noise when on. But what got my goat was when I found out in the mornign that the shower didn't work - no water came out at all. As had only allowed enough time to get ready as usual, I had to skip the shower to make my appointment in the morning. When I adivsed the manager at checkout, she apologized but offered nothing else except to use another room for a shower, which would be ok if I had planned on that, and in a tone like it was my fault for not planning appropriately. Sorry, but that's the last time I stay there. Stayed here over Christmas and new year 2009-2010. Hotel rooms are elegant, if a bit dated - but really nothing special. Booked a suite which had a substantial kitchen (including proper stove etc) but no cooking utensils or even cutlery and plates. We requested these and they tried to charge us extra! Also, internet prices and gym pricing is exorbitant.\\nBar downstairs is very nice (if overpriced) and burger joint in basement always had a long queue so didn't make it there. The lobby always resembled an airport - very busy kids everywhere (often eating McDonalds) and generally unpleasant. I was traveling with my daughter and a grand daughte (a six year old). The staff were very cordial. Our room was very small. We called for a roll away bed and they did bring the roll away but the staff had problems making it fit in the room so we asked him to remove it because we litterally had no place to walk or move around. We decided we would squeeze the six year old between us in bed but that didn't work so the poor little one slept on the floor. Way to crowded. Also the bed was not confortable. Take it from me; I travel often with my job. The location was great but i will not be staying at this hotel again unless they redo with better quality mattress and if I stay in a larger room. Also no coffee maker in the room. Also when we were checking out it took us a half hour ro get on the elevator from the 12th floor. Just back from a two night stay at what is probably the busiest time of year in New York (two weeks before Christmas).\\nI am SPG Platinum, but given that I was staying on points, and given how busy the hotel was, I didn't expect and didn't receive an upgrade. However, the standard room was great and huge by New York standards.\\nAll of the staff I encountered were pleasant and friendly. But the best part was how accomodating the hotel was when my flight home was delayed. Without a doubt, this was worth MUCH more to me than a room upgrade.\\nI would definitely stay at the Parker again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone! I was expecting a bit more. The room was fine, decent size, comfortable bed. Couldn't get the WiFi to work. No coffee maker in the room. TV was dated. Slow drains in the bathroom and some loose screws holding things together. Staff was friendly and helpful. Stayed with family for a single night. At check-in, they saw we had three children so upgraded us from a junior suite to a very large one bedroom suite - 2 baths, sitting area, big dining table, and great view of Central Park. Room was in great shape. Everyone on staff was very polite and helpful. Pool on the top floor was a big hit with the kids. Breakfast at Norma's was fantastic (~$28 / head (before tip). Physically the LPM is not on par with the NY Palace, Four Seasons, etc., but it's also significantly cheaper. A great upgrade from the standard Mariott, Sheraton, etc. if you can swing it. As a frequent traveller to NYC for both business and pleasure I have stayed at many 4 &amp; 5 star hotels in the city. This trip for pleasure I decided to cash in on a our starwood points so thought I would try the LeParker. This trip I brought my 75 year old aunt so needed to book a suite. I used Starwood points for two nights and paid for the other two. I booked a junior suite which I was told when making the reservations that the suite would have a park view which I wanted so my aunt could have a great view of the park. Upon checking in I was told that we had acutally been upgraded to a better room. Incidentally...we were NOT in an upgraded room, but had a city view room on the 23rd floor so had a view of another building! When I called to let them know that the room wasn't to my satisfaction I was basically told there wasn't anything they could do about it. Considering the room was a suite there were only towels and robes for one person. EVERY DAY..... I had to call and ask for more towels, robes, glass for the bathroom (the shot glasses in the bathroom don't count!), tissues etc. --- not sure why they coudln't figure it out on the first day!! The little extras that one has come to expect in a four star hotel were seriously lacking!! I can't imagine a hotel that doesn't have a little coffee maker in the room especially in a suite. I was less than pleased with the cleanliness of the room...mold in the shower...ick. I was told there aren't any exhaust fans in any of the rooms which was the cause of the mold problem. I realize that I am only 5'3\", but the mirrors were mounted too high for me to use and the make up mirror was located on the wall which wasn't accesible unless you crawled over the toliet. The moving/rotating entertainment in the middle of the room was rather cleaver, but not very user friendly because if one person is watching TV in the bedroom the back of the tv with the speakers etc are facing the living room----so it makes it very impractical to use if one person wants to rest in one area and someone else wants to watch TV in the other area. The burger joint in the lobby had GREAT burgers and we luckly got there before the line got too long. Food was super. The king bed in the suite was a platform bed which made it very hard, uncomfortable, and is in need of a serious mattress update. I had to laugh when we called to have the sofa bed opened when we left for dinner....housekeeping took the pillows off of the KING bed to use on the sofa sleeper bed!! I had to AGAIN call for housekeeping/front desk. None of these minor issues would normally cause me concern in a hotel, but all these little annoyances just added up and the manager on duty was apathetic at best to follow up with our concerns. He did tell me that someone from customer service would call me on the monday that we checked out, but we never recieved that follow up phone call. The hotel is in a fabulous location, but that is about it. I was left with the impression that the staff at the LeParker just didn't want to go the extra mile for the customer so with numerious great hotels in the area I will not be staying at the Le Parker again. Stayed here over Thanksgiving Weekend with my wife and 3 young children. I'm a Starwood Platinum member, so we definitely got preferred treatment. We booked two rooms on points well in advance. Everything we requested in advance as taken care of. We stayed in a Tower Junior King Suite with an adjoining king room and were on the 32nd floor (helpful in NYC because of the street noise). They placed a refrigerator in our room before we checked in, and provided a full size crib for our 2 year old, both free of charge.\\nHalfway through our 4 day stay, we had to move rooms because someone in a nearby room must have been smoking (even though it is a non-smoking hotel), and the smell of smoke was coming into our room. They moved us to the same rooms on the 30th floor the next day, even though the hotel was very crowded.\\nThe hotel has a wonderful (but small) pool on the 41st floor overlooking Central Park. The kids loved it on the day it rained. You can even order room service to be delivered poolside.\\nThe location is just about perfect for exploring much of midtown from times square to rock center to central park to 5th ave. We walked everywhere. We did not eat at any of the restaurants except for the burger joint, which can have a long line.\\nThe kids loved the TVs in the elevators! Tom and Jerry was their favorite.\\nMy only nit pick about the rooms would be the HVAC system did not work very well at times. Otherwise, the rooms are nice sized for NYC, in good shape, and worked well for us. I stay at Le Parker for a very special wedding recently. I have travelled so much that I had some free SPG nights and thought that I would use them for this stay. When I called to book, they said they would upgrade my room, but of course when I checked in the gentleman at the front desk said they didnt have an upgrade. What he didnt know is that when he went into the back to \"talk to the manager\" that the person next to me was offered all sorts of upgrades. When he came back, I asked about those rooms which seemed to be available, but he said they weren't. What frustrates me, is that I wish they would just be honest, and not lie about things. After checking in, I went up to the room, and found it to be very cold. I played with the heat for a while and no heat came out. So I called downstairs to have someone come up. Waited 20 minutes noone came. Called again, and now talked to house keeping, and they told me that there was no request for someone to come up. So I asked again. Another 20 minutes and this poor guy showed up just to tell me that the HEATING WAS OFF!! Keep in mind this is november and not warm, but apparently some people in the hotel were too warm so they turned the heating off. So he offered to bring up a portable heater which I dont expect in a hotel like this. WOW, so dissapointing... and when I checked out and mentioned this to the staff, nothing was done. the only sad part for our trip was to leave and go back home :( \\nthe staff is simply incredible always very attentive and personal - the location is great, you can walk anywhere (shopping - theater - park - restaurant) - if you need directions just go to the concierge and they will assist you with a smile and great recommendation - we went to the burger place behind the curtain next to the concierge - i understand that it is a kind of a secret.... but the burger is really heaven. We had the best capuccino and espresso, i think we will go back to Le Parker Meridien just for this. I think the name is Knave... this is not a secret - it is in the middle of the lobby. Great pool on the top floor and the breakfast in Norma's.... just a dream!!!!\\nthe rooms are nice, with a nice view and everything you need.\\nthanks again and we will come back! I just stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. I think the standard is disappointing. I was given a room facing an office building so my blinds had to be down all the time. What was most shocking is that the first night I was there, the bathtub was choked and water couldnt drain properly. When I looked closer at the drainage, I saw a huge clump of hair. Obviously the people who cleaned the room have not been removing the hair left there by the guests. We had to call the reception to get a guy to come and clear the clump of hair so that the water could flow properly. The guy had to even pour some cleaning agent into the drainage to clear the blockage and we were told to turn on the tap and let the water run 15 mins later so that the cleaning agent could be washed away. I wouldnt stay there again. I went to visit a friend who stayed at the London Hotel just a few streets away. Honestly I would stay there the next time. The rooms are at least 3 times better than Le Parker's but the price that she paid was just slightly more than what I had to pay for Le Parker Meridien. I am in the consulting industry and have been traveling on and off to New York for about a year now. The majority of my time spent in the city, I have stayed at the Parker Meridien. Its not easy living out of a suitcase, or working long days just to come home to an empty hotel room but I can say that returning to LPM every evening was something that I looked forward to. The staff greeted me each time I checked in with a smile and even remembered my name. The room service was phenomenal and even though I was on an expense account, I chose to eat there at least 3 times a week. The gym was a huge selling point for me - classes in the morning, and open late for days when I couldn't get out of the office at a reasonable time. From someone who lived out of a hotel for a full year - I can say my experience at LMP was far and away the best I have had and I would choose to stay there every time I come to NYC whether it be for business or pleasure. We stayed 2 nights at this hotel Check-in was a breeze and because I am a starwood gold member, we were given a room with distant views of Central Park. The lobby is designed poorly...too many mirrors lining the walls made me dizzy everytime I passed through.The rooms are a decent size by NY standards and the layout allows for 2 people to navigate around. We had no problem controlling the A/C but agree that the water pressure is a little weak, but certianly not unbearable. \\nThe beds were comfortable and I have never slept better in NY - the noise from the street never made it to the 26th floor! The doorman were always pleasant and the front desk staff, although not warm and fuzzy, were far from rude. The Fitness center was AMAZING! This is our new \"go-to\" hotel. My company spent tens of thousands of dollars in rooms and conference services (hotel occupying a ballroom for the entire day, with a formal lunch served for over 100 people) over a two-day period and were nevertheless treated to the utmost rudely sarcastic and offensively uncivil behavior by the hotel staff. I cant bring myself to spell out the sentences that were hurled at us when we merely sat down in the lounge area of the cafe in the lobby. And management did absolutely nothing.\\nThere are many other and better hotels in NYC that offer polite service so why spend money on people who basically brawl and behave like members of an inner-city gang. On top of this, the rooms were dirty and the bathrooms appallingly small with a toilet lid that did not stay up, a broken handle, and gum on the filthy carpeting. \\nIf they treat high paying customers like this, imagine how they treat \"the help\" which is how one member of middle management referred to those poor hard-working cleaning staff. I have 3 complaints and that should be enough for you:\\n1. No air conditioning -- you cannot turn on your own air in your room. You must open the window (yes - hard to believe). Pretty expensive room ($450+) for NO AIR\\n2. No water pressure -- you know the kind where you have trouble staying warm and getting the shampoo out of your hair\\n3. the service/management team -- they all need a refresher course in how to speak with guests (if they ever had one before)\\nDo yourself a favor -- GO TO ANOTHER HOTEL -- where you can spend $450 and actually get AIR or a decent SHOWER (not to mention service!) This hotel is great. Awesome location, close to times square, Central park and amazing shopping. The rooms are very nice, comfortable. My only suggestion is ask for a high floor, if you are on a low floor you hear a lot of street noise.\\nNice gym, and pool on the top floor. Great hotel that feels very posh without being \"snooty\". Clean, well appointed contemporary rooms. We'll definitely stay here again! We are Gold SPG members and this place does not match category 5 hotel, and this hotel is a dissapointment. At the check-in the service was acceptable. We were given a room on the 12th floor facing construction, I complained and was given a room on the 28th floor with a partial park view. The room was filthy! I don't consider myself a picky person, but please take a look at the pictures, I could not see the time on the clock, it was so much dust on it. I complained to the manager, the room was cleaned, but not too much. There were stains on the lamps, mini bar, practically everywhere I looked it was something off. The TV was old and the mattress was even older. To make things worst: Mini bar fridge was not working, we called 3 times to have it fixed and it was not fixed and no alternative was offered. We were told we would be given a better room the next time we stay, but I am afraid there is only one first time impression. If you would like a nice 5 category hotel, stay at Westin, we were treated nicely and had the best stay there plus location is much better. Also, need to mention the security is lacking at the entry to Le Parker, my sister did not stay in the hotel and was able to come up to the room without any ID check numerious times and when we stayed at Westin, ID and keys were always required at night. and be of assistance.. My brother loved the place.. I got it for him for his 40th bday.. He and his wife loved it, but the Desk Staff was unintelligible, and rude!!!! during all of my calls to them to make these very special reservations.. At 400 plus, a night, that service should have been the 1st thing that the Le Parker needs to do some quality control on!!! 4 calls, and 4 rude, people! very friendly staff - large hotel room by New York standards!!! Clean rooms and bathrooms. Lovely comfy bed. Would definitely stay again. Easy striking distance for subway, attractions, etc. Bar a bit strange - sort of like a corridor - not tempting enough for us. Good location in Midtown. Room simple modern and comfortable. I like the eclectic bar with a french european old world funky feel. Depending on rates would stay again. The front desk was wonderful. I had received a large package with a fragile component that got shipped late and by the time I unwrapped everything, I had a big box with styrfoam peanuts, small and large bubble wrap. One call to the front desk and it was taken care of. I did not have to ask for housekeeping or engineering. The concierge and front desk were very helpful. We had a splendid stay at the Le Parker Meridien! The hotel-team was friendly and welcoming and the room (junior suite) was top... The friendly and welcoming service attitute is rare in New York. Le Parker Meridien-team: we will be back! This was our first trip to New York, But not our last. It was exciting \\nThe hotel is just a block away from Central Park, which we spent 2 days exploring\\nA short walk from Time Square Which we spent every day exploring All in all a Great get away. My family and friends have stayed at this hotel numerous times and were extremely dissatisfied during our last visit:\\n Tired-looking surroundings and appointments\\n Cheap renovations\\n Poor service\\n Arrogant, condescending manager\\n Dishonesty from manager and service people\\nThey did not handle returning guests as valued customers, and we will stay elsewhere in NYC when BEDBUG issues resolved. Visited weekend of Oct. 21-24. Decided on LPM through recommendation from a Starwood employee/exec and paid with SPG points. Great location, cool hotel at a glance. Booked room on the phone a couple of months before and noted that we had a young teen and a party of 3 total and reservationist said room has two double beds so we were OK with that (we did the same thing at Times Square Sheraton previous year). Were told at LPM front desk we couldn't have three to the room and were basically told we needed a rollaway at $50/night. Rollaway came late (near 11 pm) the first night and was OK/typical rollaway. We did get upgraded to a Deluxe (nice room), but the king bed isn't Sweet Sleeper Sheraton material; not much to it (hard mattress) and didn't sleep well. Room was drafty but there were no temperature controls. Burger Joint is crowded but is a gem with great burgers and reasonable Sam Adams pitchers if you can find a seat. Friendly baggage handlers and doormen and front desk people polite but don't have much clout in upgrading (I've never have been charged extra at a Sheraton property before). Don't understand the concept of an \"upgrade\" with extra charges (seems counterproductive), and I read a number of posts on TripAdvisor that noted that SPG Gold members are upgraded routinely. No newspapers or free Internet, which easily could be offered at a room that probably sells for $500-$700/night. Stayed three nights in a junior suite. Prior to arrival, Margaret at the front desk was wonderful with reinstating my accommodations when Starwood's customer service messed up my reservation. Check in was a breeze. You do have to walk through Knave, the hotel bar, if you enter from 57th street, but if you take the 56th street entrance you go right to the front desk. The lobby area was always bustling during our stay, but it was quiet up on our floor. My ten year old loved the cartoons in the elevator and the roof top pool. The views from both the pool and attached outdoor sun deck are beautiful. Our junior suite was very spacious and both the bedroom bed and the sofa bed were comfortable. I'm a light sleeper, but was not disturbed by outdoor or hotel sounds during my stay. \\nWe had drinks and coffee at Knave. The room is beautiful and the service was good. We ate at the Burger Joint twice and it was delicious and reasonable. \\nThe location is close to multiple subway stops and just two blocks from Central Park. It was easy walking to Rockfeller Center, MoMA, Times Square, Empire State Building, and the musuems at Central Park, but I am quite a walker. If you don't walk as much, it is good to know the subway is close by.\\nWe had great meals nearby at Rue 57, just about half a block from the hotel at 57th and 6th and also at Bouchon Bakery in the Time Warner Center. \\nI would stay here again because I really liked the location. I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. Very convenient as the location is close to my NYC offices. The breakfast is particularly exceptionnal (I recommend the chestnut pancake. Loved the hotel, the location and everything about it. We had a room with 2 double beds which were comfortable. The room was spacious which I didn't really expect for New York. I would stay at this hotel again The general feel of this place is sophistication. It is in a quiet, non-touristy location, but within walking distance to all of the mid-town attractions. The lobby is nice, however, I didn't like that, to get to check-in, you have to walk through an upscale bar. It was a bit awkward to roll in my luggage beside people who were dressed up and getting ready for a night on the town. The rooms were a bit disappointing. I thought they would match the general feel of the hotel, but they don't. They are nice and clean, but small and decorated with weird (unhip) colours. Great toiletries! There is also a really cool burger restaurant on the main lobby that you must try whether you are staying here or not. It's hidden, so you may need to ask a staff member to help you find it.\\nOverall, my stay was comfortable, but I wouldn't rush back here. I'd rather stay at the Hilton which is around the corner. The rooms at the Hilton are bigger and nicer and generally less expensive. Good location central to all the NYC touristy attractions. Great hip atmosphere and not your typical standard hotel look. Rooms were quite spacious for NYC standards although I believe I was slightly upgraded as SPG gold member. I think I had deluxe room. \\nGreat lobby with good lobby bar. Burger bar in back hidden gem and great burgers. Didn't check out Normas as very expensive but heard it was great. Best thing about the hotel is the very relaxing rooftop where you get a nice view of city. Nice to just go out, grab one of their lounge chair and take a nap or read a book. A nice oasis after walking around the city all day. Also carnegie deli nearby. As an added note, if you don't valet and self park, I believe it is cheaper (around 25-30 dollars) look for coupons on the internet for NYC parking. Stayed here on a business trip. Room in excellent condition despite older age of hotel. Gorgeous view of central park to the north. Super convenient and quiet. Strangely TV was old, but picture was ok. I imagine they are updating those in a cycle. Check in was prompt and staff was very attentive. Would absolutely return. My husband and I stayed at the Parker Le Meridien for a wedding weekend in late August. While we usually stay at a Marriott in NYC, we were very pleased with our experience, The staff was very helpful, offering us late checkout on Sunday at no additional charge. Brunch at Norma's was scrumptious....although quite busy. I think it is deserving of its reputation for \"best brunch in New York. While the rooms are small, they have interesting modern decor. We did feel, however, that the halls were a little too dark and somber. We checked out the rooftop pool which has a great view, but again, is on the smallish side. We do realize though that having a pool at all in NYC is a bonus. The hotel was very convenient to the subway and had entrances on 2 blocks which was helpful. We recommend this hotel and will revisit. Stayed for a wedding weekend. Great location, near multiple subway lines to get around and in the center of town and an easy taxi to most parts of the city. \\nStaff is friendly and attentive. Excellent spot for a burger and fantastic restaurant located in the lobby. \\nThe pool could be a little better but it has an amazing view of Central Park. Would love to stay there again! It's a superb hotel with good staff, a great burger joint and bar all downstairs, swimming pool on the roof and based neatly between 5th, Central Park and Times Square.\\nI had asked for and received a Park View room, overlooking the park obviously and although the hotel was busy in my two weeks there (fashion week then UN week) it never felt rushed or crowded. Colleague staying in other hotel was impressed with room! In conjunction with Phillip Morris and the 7-up Brooklyn Bottling Company Inc., \\nmany funcitons were held at your hotel over the years. I am in love with your hotel. I recently moved back to New York from San Diego, and I now have the time to rekindle the flame with your hotel. Everyone worked hard to greet you, remember you, and make you feel at home. Thank you for the peaceful and quiet accommodations. The pool area is marvelous. Everything is well thought out and maintained. As an author, I travel extensively and appreciate excellence in management. Bravo!\\nProblems you asked? Absolutely not! First of all, I should highlight that the purpose of my trip was to celebrate being with my girlfriend for a year and so wanted to propose whilst in New York. So I wanted somewhere that would be well located and be lush enough to make my girlfriend have the New York WOW factor.\\nMy experience started with a very friendly and very efficient check-in (just what we needed after a 10hr trip!) and when walking around to the separate luxury lifts I knew we were on to a winner!! We got the lift to the top floor where there are rooms (41st) and even walking out into the lift lobby Claire and I could see how amazing our room view was going to be!\\nOn entering our room we had some complementary treats but the really lovely thing was a card and poem from Lisa Tharp of guest relations whom I had emailed just prior to going. I had already paid for an upgraded room to have a park view but the little touches Lisa had put in place really made a difference and for that I am very very grateful.\\nOur room - 4105\\nOk so the view WAS AMAZING - ALL of central park the trump tower etc. on clear view.\\nThere was a coat room area with iron, safe and umbrella - though luckily for us was gorgeous sunshine Sat 2nd and Sun 3rd of October :)\\nThere was a pleasant seat, desk and the note to say what was on and details of the events in New York and restaurants details etc. were perfect. The swivelling TV unit was cool as it enabled snuggles in the morning and the bed was perfect for me and my now fiancee who are both over 6ft tall! \\nEverything you'd expect from a bathroom was there and was well lit for getting ready for a night out!\\nWe went to Knave for cocktails, which were sublime and got us in the mood for our dinner out in the city later.\\nNorma's for breakfast, which really showed why it consistently gets voted best brekkie in NY. My buckwheat gallettes filled with emmenthal, ham and topped with poached egg were divine and despite the price being $70 for two breakfasts was very good value!\\nSince I read about the Burger Joint in Heston Blumenthal's book I have wanted to go here so when I saw it was in my hotel I was the happiest guy! I like my fine food but the burgers in there were nothing less than fantastic. The burger meat is cooked to taste which means (as a European- this is what you want) I had a rare cooked burger and the bun was so thin and crisp the moisture of meat made it taste like packaged up goodness in parcel! \\nFlawless from start to finish and could not recommend this hotel more - thanks again Lisa,\\nJohn My fiance and I spent two wonderful nights at the Le Parker Meridian in September 2010. The service was top notch from check-in, where we received a listing of \"happenings\" in NYC that prompted us to go to the San Genarro festival on the spur of the moment, to the concierge who helped us with nice dinner reservations. Norma's for breakfast is not to be missed - a top rated eatery that lives up to its billing! The location is close to the Theatre District and Central Park and is only a block away from a convenient subway station. We will definitely come back to spend more time at Le Parker Meridian! The strengths of this hotel are its location, its staff and its very serviceable room. It is located a short walk to times square and is a great location if your business takes you to midtown. If you have a few minutes you can easily get to Central Park, midtown shopping, and theatre. The room itself is spiffy and efficient and fairly roomy. I had a junior suite that was indeed pretty \"junior\" but it was reasonably comfortable:Modern, with a good desk set up, an aeron chair a cool looking entertainment center with plasma tv that rotates on a stylish axis -- so you can watch tv from the living area or from the bed. I think the best hting at the hotel is a pool, beautifully situated with amazing views and open for long hours. I loved it. The bed was comfortable with good quality linens and the bathroom was very nice. The shower was, again very stylish, though there was no tub. My one quarrel with the bathroom (talk about nitpicking but it bugged me) was that there was no way to turn the shower on without standing directly under the water stream, ie. no way to avoid that rush of cold water while you are adjusting the temperature. See I told you it was nitpicking. More importantly, I didn't much care for the room service -- again lovely people but the menu was limited and extremely expensive, even for New York. Also, the a la carte breakfast menu was so limited that a bowl of berries and two poached eggs would have cost $60, just because I couldn't seem to persuade them to shed the potatoes and meat I didn't want. Now there is no such thing as a good deal on a room service breakfast in New York, but this was one of the most outlandish I have encountered. \\nThe staff was just lovely, from room service to the concierge to the fellow at front desk trying to deal with the one thing that was truly, truly annoying: the high speed internet. It has to be the highest priced daily cost I have ever seen in the city (including much better hotels), and it worked poorly. Sadly, the internet service is outsourced to a company that further outsources its help desk. The hotel staff was powerless to remove the charge. He tried valiently to deal with the the outsourcer's outsourcer, but it was just impossible. They had an incomprehensible series of steps to take and codes to remember if i wanted to \"prove\" that the service didn't work. It was truly ridiculous and in the end, of course, not worth it. The front desk guy was truly chagrined. But if you are traveling on business decent wireless matters, and this was unacceptable. while I can't say I will never go back, I can say that I will probably avoid the hotel if other choices are available. Stayed the week of September 20th and I will try to give future guests an unbiased view....\\nLet's start with the positives: Staff was extremely courteous and accomodating. Never could I pass a staff member wothout a cheerful and enthusiastic hello. Several orders from room service were delivered on time and fresh and location is hard to beat. Close to Central Park (3 blocks) and many other main NY hotspots. Rooms were clean and housekeeping kept them tidy all week. We had a room on the 25th floor and while the view towards CP is nice, I feel you need to be up at least on 30 or higher to fully appreciate. We were in deluxe room and while not large it certainly did'nt feel claustrophobic. Now for the \"opportunities: Bring cash, lot's of cash. At a discounted corporate rate our room was $439 plus about $70 in tax. Norma's and anything on room service menu is going to be $$$$. But, hey this is NY. Rooms are getting a little \"tired\" . What was chic in 1995 is just looking old now. Old style TV with poor reception and out of date clocks/phones/lamps, etc. Once again, room was clean and that is most important, but if Le Parker would do some minor updating they could play with the \"big boys\". While at $500+ night I feel that Le Parker slightly misses the mark in the higher end hotel, it makes up for it's misses with excellent customer service and location. I stayed in this hotel for 1 week on june 2010.\\nThe hotel is very confortable and the position is excellent.\\nI met often business man customers.\\nThe best rooms are on the uppers floor (with a great view).\\nThe swimming pool on the top floor is fantastic.\\nInside the lobby there's a typical burger house. I stayed here for me and my fiance's birthday celebration. I used 4800 points and I spent another $106 on the hotel, and I gave a charitable donation to Norma's, New York's most overpriced and overrated breakfast experience. This also doesn't relfect the fact that I had a very very disappointing experience at your hotel. I live in Los Angeles, and I was visiting my Fiance in Philadelphia and this was supposed to be a very very special dual birthday celebration. I believe that it is in the public interest to know what people dont see from the pictures - a very expensive best western. \\nStaying at a nice hotel in NYC is supposed to be a wonderful and magical experience. I had many different luxury hotels to choose from, both Starwoods and not, and I am still so dissappointed that I choose Le Parker Meridien. I wish I could go back in time and choose one of the W's or something, but I can't. I have stayed at Meridien's before and they are usually very nice... this one needs to be gutted and updated. \\nThe TV buzzed loudly - when I called they sent and engineer who didnt speak any english and he stood and stared at the tv and told me he didnt know what he could do. He should have switched our room or replaced the tv... \\nThe mattress is thin and old - nothing heavenly about this bed. \\nLamp was broken.\\nSoap dish broken.\\nPopcorn ceilings. \\nGross! I would not recommend this to anyone. Stay somewhere else. \\nWhen I reported my dissatisfaction, they offered a nominal amount of points and told me the case was closed... Stunning hotel with a boutique feel. Bathroom is AMAZING. Huge, with giant walk in slate shower. We got the deluxe suite. Love the Burger Joint downstairs and location is pretty good, but all the cool places to eat and go out at night are a train or cab ride away. When me and my girlfriend first arrived at this hotel, we was blown away! I honestly felt a little out of place that it might be too posh for us!\\nWe made it to the desk an hour before check-in and the desk advised us to have a stroll round central park and they would get us a room with a view. . . We ended up on the top floor with and amazing city view!\\nAll week the staff helped us with anything we needed, the roof top pool was amazing, my girlfriend spent along time in there.\\nOnly downside is i would of rather of paid for the room up front than wait till later. I was told the hotel would \"freeze\" the money so i couldn't spend it but i spoke with my bank and it wasn't possible. That was the only down side for me.\\nIf we ever come back to New York we will come back here. Thank you. $450 rooms but charge you $20 for a toothbrush and paste.....drugstore is 1.5 blocks away. But that sums it up. \\nListen, rooms are small.....but that's Manhattan. The lobby is crowded, no carpet, lack expansive feeling, but that's Manhattan. Location is excellent -- near major subways right near CP, FAO Schwartz, 5th Avenue shopping, Broadway, restaurants. View of CP is actually quite good. Pool is nice, but small. \\nStaff was excellent. Hotel is quiet. Not too great for kids though. \\nBasically, would give it 4-stars if it was $300/nt, but it's not. It wants to play with the big boys because it has a \"park view\" rooms -- which it does, although another street (of mostly shorter) buildings blocks your view from directly overlooking CP. \\nI could see it being a good business hotel. But, you sort of wish the lobby was grander and less crowded -- not a real \"comforting\" place to return to lobbywise. I've stayed at the Waldorf a couple years ago and that place felt magical. \\nThe thing that irked me though was after a rough slog quickly packing and getting into the city, realized I forget my toothbrush, asked to have a complimentary one and was told that it and the paste would be $20. \\nI know it's a \"business hotel\" and it's the banker who stays here normally gets to \"write off\" that money as a business expense (not only do they get bailouts, they get subsidized $20 toothbrushes) but it was the weekend and tourists were responsible for the guests, perhaps they could change the policy then? \\nNote to great staff otherwise Undercut management and make some cash. Go to the drugstore 1.5 blocks away, get the toothpaste and brush, return and charge $12. You;ll see profits about $8-9 -- but more importantly you'll give off the feeling that you go the extra for the customer also. It served its purpose for a conference... nice modern rooms with a decent view. Hotel staff were adequate with concerns and addressed them in a timely fashion. Travelling with two adults and two teenagers while visiting local art schools. Stayed 3 nights in an upgraded suite and a double on the same high floor. A/C worked well during 90 plus degree weather, and rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. Thankfully No Bugs, although a nearby theater was closed during our visit due to those nasty bed bugs...front page of Daily News had a huge article on NYC bedbug outbreak during our stay so we were thankful we stayed at the Parker. \\nDouble facing Central Park had a great view. Old school big tube TVs and NO FREE WIRELESS INTERNET access were a big disappointment for everyone...(c'mon management, it's a new millenium...I Pads and HD flat screens should be standard everywhere by now in a hotel of this class)...but otherwise rooms were typical size and layout for NYC. \\nENCLOSED ROOF TOP POOL was open (although stifling in the heat and humidity) and kids didn't want to use it, but we loved having access to the outdoor roof...views are good, there's lots of rubble and some areas are closed off and in disrepair, but still a nice perk for midtown--but they close the rooftop access early so you can't sneak up to take in the nighttime views.\\nAll in all, we enjoyed our stay and weren't bothered at all by the press and Jonas Brothers/Camp Rock folks holding interviews while we were there...but for the herd of black Denali Limos parked out front, you'd never know any teen idols were in the hotel...someone was doing a GREAT JOB there...\\nI like this hotel, and I hope management continues to repair and improve this property so it will be here when my children come to visit with their families.\\nPrices are comparable to nearby higher end properties...so it's still worth the price of admission to stay at the Parker. My most disappointing stay in the past two years at any Starwood Hotel as a Starwood Platinum. I have no interest in taking any further time here to spell out my disappointment, as I firmly believe management at this hotel truly wouldn't care anyway. But, I will try to take the time to email the President of Starwood and/or the head of N. American operations in the near future to discuss my stay here and, hopefully, that might lead to some significant changes at this hotel and the way they treat all guests, including Platinums. Booked a last minute trip over the phone for a saturday night. I mentioned that I was bringing two dogs as I found out they were pet friendly. So the reservation was complete and I went ahead and paid the \"pay now and save\" option. We checked in and somehow got an upgrade to a Junior Suite from Deluxe room...very nice. Since I already told them about my dogs, I wsn't aware that I had to register my dogs. Our suite was nice and had the right plan/idea. workmanship/craftsmanship was just a little weak.\\nWent out for dinner, but had to cut it short...got a call from the hotel saying that my dogs were barking like crazy (oops!) Ran back to the hotel to find out that the security guy was at the door and he was pissed...made it sound like we snuck the dogs in. BTW, my dogs were right next to me as we were checking in. \\nAnywho, I went to the front desk and \"registered\" my dogs. $50 per pet is very affordable. What annoyed me was the fact that one of the front desk (female) employees whispered loudly to the gentleman who was helpling me \"...I can't believe they did this, it's $50 per pet, and that's a hundred dollars\". But I wasn't going to open my mouth and start anything since we were at fault :-) besides I was tired and already had a few drinks and didn't need any hoopla. I just stood there pretended that I didn't hear anything. Then the gentleman very politely gave me the paperwork and nicely asked me to not leave the dogs in the rooms by themselves. Done.\\nCheck out was a breeze. Somehow someone ordered breakfast and put it on our tab...they took care of the error immediately.\\nI like the 12:00 PM checkout. \\nI would definitely stay here again, but I first need to try out the other pet friendly places... Hotel Penn, Marriott Marquis, 70 Park Avenue etc etc. We had the best time staying at the Parker Meridien, the location was in walking distance to the theatre at night, museums during the day and dinner at the Time Warner bldg. The food at Norma's is not to be believed, and the bar at night as well as coffee served there during the day was exceptional. I cannot wait to book my next visit and stay there! The Parker offered everything we were looking for in a NYC hotel.\\nWe were one of 5 couples who stayed at the hotel in order to have a true NYC experience. All of us were delighted with the service, food and overall ambience if the hotel.\\nThanks for a terrific time! This hotel was close to midtown and Times Square, on a quiet street between 6th &amp; 7th Avenues.\\nThe rooms were modern and comfortable. It being NYC, of course they were overpriced.\\nThe front desk/lobby were extremely under-staffed, with a long wait to check in and check/retrieve luggage - unacceptable for a large and pricey hotel. The people working there were reasonably friendly (by NYC standards).\\nThe burger place off the lobby is high quality, basic and affordable cuisine - thumbs up! I have been traveling from Boston to NYC on business regularly, for the last 10 years. I have stayed in hotels that rank from the best to the worst. The high-speed internet company I work for watches every penny we spend. This hotel is by far one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The service is outstanding, the rooms are impeccable and the location is perfect. It's comfortable, safe and a great value for the money. Decided to head down to the city for a quick trip for my birthday with my girlfriend. Got in touch with Lisa from Guest Relations to see if she could help me with a room with a great view of Central Park...ended up on the 41st floor (highest you can go). The view was worth every penny and will have me coming back to this hotel time and time again. Thank you so much Lisa! The front desk and bellmen were also very nice and helpful in our visit with really no wait for service. The hotel itself was everything I expected of it and more, with a beautiful lobby and nicely appointed rooms. I also enjoyed Burger Joint, it's quite unique for being in a hotel like Le Parker Meridien. The location of the hotel is perfect as it's within a half block of 2 subway lines and walking distance to 5th Ave. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel and will be back again. We chose Le Parker Meridien, because it was recommended by Fodor's as \"family friendly\". The only thing family friendly was a coloring book handed out at check-in and a television showing cartoons in the elevator, which didn't impress my son. We wanted a luxury hotel close to Central Park, and this hotel was very convenient for walking to the park. We were told we were being upgraded to a very special room. We stayed in room 2921. I don't know what the standard rooms were like, but this room did not seem like an upgraded room. The room was very quiet, and the bed was comfortable, but the room was dusty. We heard great things about the Burger Joint, but never got to try it. While waiting in line to place our order, guests from the back of the line came in and took all the empty tables prior to ordering their food. When we mentioned this to the man behind the counter, his response was he just worked there and couldn't get involved. We had our 19 month old son with us, so we left. We went to Angelo's Coal Oven Pizzeria across the street and had delicious pizza and fried calamari. Norma's breakfast was very good and expensive. They provide high chairs and booster seats, but we didn't feel the restaurant was a good choice for small children. The staff was accommodating, but not very friendly. The front desk staff however, were exceptionally friendly. We visited FAO Schwartz, which was a few blocks away. They have men dressed as toy soldiers roll out a red carpet and play a bugle to announce the store is open. The employees line up inside and clap as you enter the store. That was special for the kids. Le Parker Meridien was an average hotel. For the price we paid, there are better options for our next visit to New York. You might have heard the words \"a home away from home\" ? Anyway it is one way to describe how we value our stay at Le Parker Meridien New York.\\nFrom a general point of view: Excellent location (of course, it was one of the main reasons for us to select Le Parker Meridien), with a GREAT VIEW from our room !\\nIn particular: This trip, which was only a 5 night trip, was to celebrate our 1-year anniversary as a married couple. For us a very special moment.\\nJust prior to our arrival I made contact to ms Lisa Tharp (Guest Relation Manager) to get some foam pillows for my wife - which we did get of course (more than we expected actually - this was greate service!). I also happened to mention our anniversary for ms Lisa Tharp, so we also got a surprise in our room: Chocolate dropped strawberry's which was such a great surprise !! Oboy my wife and I really like them :-)\\nBut what made all the difference for us, was ms Lisa Tharp's biggest surprise in setting us up in room 4009 on 40th floor.\\nYes we did order a park view room (that was about all I could control when American Express did the reservation), and we kindly asked for a high floor room with view over Central Park (which we totally love).\\nHowever we could never imagine to get this high up, and with such a great room - and man did we like that view !!! I could easily go on and on about the view.... We did have some jetlag and woke up at 3 in the morning, and just watching out that window over Central Park made our day - every day !!! I wish somewhere in my heart that we one day might move to New York and get a chance to live with that view each day!\\nAnyway, we had a great stay, we loved the burger joint, and most of all:\\nWe totally loved Le Parker Meridien and the very good help from Le Parker Meridien staff, and in particular ms Lisa Tharp. We will return, you can count on that !! We were looking forward to a great hotel in a great location, but were very disappointed. Our printed reservation said that we had a king room connected to two double beds. As we have four children, we needed the second room to allow for the kids to share. Upon arrival, when we looked at the second room, there were two twins, not doubles. I called down to reception and the person at the other line could care less about my dilemma. He said he could send up a cot that would have to go in my room as the other room could only accomodate two people. Not only that, the cot charge was $50 per night! There was no \"Sorry mam\" for the confusion on the reservation and no attempt to accomodate us by reducing or waving the charge for the cot.\\nWhen it came time to get a cab out front, the doorman was snooty and outright ignored us! I had to go inside to ask about getting a taxi and someone inside had to come out and ask him again!\\nWe had wanted to take our children down for breakfast one morning, and called the front desk the night before to ensure that there was a children's menu available. We were told of course. So, we head down the next morning, and guess what? NO children's menu for any meals there!!! So frustrating and I was not spending $25 on pancakes for my kids! Found a great place - Teleon Cafe- up the street on the opposite side that had breakfasts for $5 for the kids. Food and service was great there!\\nIn addition to the above, the fire detector in our room buzzed all night as the battery had not been replaced, and the safe in our room was locked and therefore could not be used. We mentioned all of the above to the front desk manager who didn't seem to care very much. \\nOverall, poor service and definitely not value for the money. Looks like a nice hotel, but looks deceived us in this case. I love this hotel. There is so much thought put into every little detail and you will enjoy your experience here guaranteed. The rooms are well-designed and many have great views. Comfortable beds and wonderful restaurants (Norma's has amazing brunch, Nave amazing coffee, and Burger Joint amazing burgers) in the midst of Midtown. Just fantastic! I got this room after I bid in Priceline, the location is great. Close to central park, 5th ave, Time square and a lot of restaurant.... The hotel is decorate like \"Ikea style but the lobby area is very stylish and elegant compare withe the decoration in the rooms. The rooms very tiny, beds very confortable but tiny. I request two bed for my family of 3, my and my husband does not fit in one bed. I ended sleep with my daughter. The room very clean and service ies great. My spouse and I needed a romantic getaway weekend in NY and after considering several hotel options, decided on 2 nights at Le Parker Meridian. We definitely made the right choice! We used starpoints for one of the nights. Check in was smooth, the lobby is very elegant and the staff pleasant. We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite. There was a bedroom with king size bed, plenty of closet space (by the way, the closet curtains are of a beautiful velvet material, not cheesy at all), a living room area with couch, desk, table and minibar and a decent size bathroom. Our tub was a typical bathtub shower combo but the water pressure was amazing. We took 2 showers a day just for the experience. Our friends had a suite on another level with a more modern glass enclosed shower but complained they had poor water pressure. Our air conditioning was perfect, not noisy at all. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in and the sheets and bedding were perfect. It was the best night sleep I have gotten in a long time. Housekeeping was very good, the room was very clean. There is a nice indoor pool on the rooftop with outdoor sunning option. Nice view of Central Park. There is an elegant bar near the lobby where we had a drink with friends the first evening. The drinks were good but $18 for a drink is expensive, even by NY standards. I didn't like the entrance to the Burger Joint on the main floor. It was hard to find the entrance and it was surrounded by huge curtains. There were long lines some of the time and the space was very small. With so many dining options in the area, we decided it wasn't worth the wait. Central Park is about 2 1/2 blocks away. The weather was perfect for a stroll in the park and, boy, did I get a workout, but worth every minute. Central Park is probably the best park I know. Go on a sunny day so you can enjoy the many talented street musicians throughout the park. Carnegie Hall is about a block away and Times square is a short walk away. I loved that we were able to enjoy Times square and come back to a quiet place as Times Square can be overwhelming. Taxis are always waiting in front of the hotel so if you don't want to walk somewhere, you can pick one up conveniently. We wanted to see a comedy show so we called the Concierge ahead of time and they recommended Caroline's Comedy Club which was about 4 blocks away. This was a good recommendation. We did not try Norma's but hear they have a very good, but expensive, breakfast. Overall, our goal of a romantic weekend was met thanks to NYC and Le Parker Meridian. We can't wait to come back! It is an old hotel, built in 1981 according to nice bellboy who said he has been working there since opening. Had a renewed bathroom , but the room looked definitely like a cheap second class hotel. I was thinking that anyway the staff is friendly they are making it up, but then during the check out I met that guy -Lawrence- who works at the reception but thinks he owns the whole building. When asked to print the invoice with company title he answers: \" let me see if i can do it or not ? When I told him I want to get the adaptor and I want to be charged for it because i need it , he insisted that i cannot :) for 3 times. It took 3 minutes to let him go and ask manager and come back with an 'oh you can yes\" . Then he printed the invoice and put it on the desk like 'take it and leave' manner . I asked for an envelope then he had a deep breath and this time he put the envelope in the same manner on the desk. It was enought then I called for the FD manager and complained. Has it worked? I don't know , but you will see if you go there:) Would I go there again or recommend? No for sure. Great hotel in great position. Small pool but good to come back to. Breakfast deserves its reputation but VERY expensive. Fantastic burger bar hiding behind the curtain in the foyer- very cheap. Just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay at the Parker Meridien. We had 2 rooms on the 9th floor. We choose the hotel for the location. It is walking distance to Central Park &amp; Times Square. Our check-in went very smoothly. The young lady at the front desk was very pleasant, friendly &amp; funny! She quickly sized us up &amp; recommended a very nice bar nearby with a fantastic \"Happy Hour\"! The rooms were larger than expected for NYC and very clean and pleasant. There wasn't much drawer space, but the 'closet', had some shelves that we used. It was actually just a rod &amp; shelving behind a curtain. The bathroom was a little small and there is not much counterspace for toiletries, but it was beautiful. The hotel provided toiletries were wonderful. My roommate &amp; I fought over who got to take them home! We didn't eat at either restaurant, but they seemed to be popular. We did visit the lounge for some delicious, but very expensive, cocktails. The service here was wonderful. Bartenders spoke to us everytime we walked through, even if we didn't sit &amp; order drinks. Waitstaff was quick to make recommendations too. The rooftop pool was small but very nice, clean area, again friendly staff. The views from the rooftop terrace were amazing! The lobby felt very safe, room cards were checked when we returned late at night. The guy at the front desk was very funny, jokingly expressing the concern of a father when we came 'home' in the wee hours of the morning! The concierge was very helpful with suggestions &amp; reservations. All in all, the Parker made my first visit to NYC very enjoyable! I would gladly return &amp; will recommend to others! Our two night stay at the Meridien, located on West 56th street, 3 blocks south of Central Park, was more than perfect. We were upgraded to a room on the 32nd floor which afforded us a gorgeous view of the park. The hotel is a short walk to Times Square but away from the maddening crowd. Our room was tastefully decorated to maximize its space and create an open and modern feel. The bathroom is generous by new york standards and well appointed. We visited the lobby bar which was fun and relaxing and they accommodate tea totalers such as myself! I loved the nut bowl which accompanies your order! And, you must have breakfast/brunch at Normas, located off the lobby. It was simply the most yummy breakfast ever--not cheap--but worth every penny! Our server was divine--attentive and cheery. \"Come hungry, darling\"--the portions are humungous and to die for! My family and I traveled to New York to be interviewed by CBS about our buffalo attack. I was completely miserable as I was suffering a serious hematoma in my leg. I was not impressed with New York itself under the circumstances, but I loved this hotel. It was truly the best part of my trip. After the interview, all I wanted to do was get back to the hotel, order room service and rest. I did just that. The room was beautful, the food was better than homemade, the bed was comfortable and I ordered a movie, and was in heaven. Everybody was so kind and considerate. What I saw of the facilities was beautiful, though I couldn't swim or workout, it would have been a dream to be able to do it with such an incredible view of the city. Overall the stay was wonderful. I was in NYC for the NYC Triathlon. When I was scheduled to check in the room wa sall ready for me. The lady in the front saw I had two kids and knew the room I had requested wasn't really the right size for my family. She worked with me on getting an upgrade. And when the new room wasn't ready yet they took care of all my stuff (luggage, golf clubs, Triathlon bike, etc) and I was able to enjoy the city with the family for a bit. The room was fantastic. The kids loved it. And although its a upscale type of place the staff was down to earth and very freindly. Even the elevators were giving Popeye cartoons when we went up. Fun for the kids as well as my wife and I as it brought back memories of our childhood. My wife and I stayed at the Parker Sept. 2006. The modern hotel was prefectly located for access to Central Park and surrounding attractions. The modern rooms were spacious and offered good views. Check in was easy and the staff was agreeable. There was nothing that overwhelmed me about this hotel but if you want a hotel close to Central Park at a decent value then pick the Le Parker Meridien. Traveled with a family from Germany, including 8 and 12 year old boys, and all the staff, especially concierge and registration desks, were terrific in their advice about what to do, what to avoid, and how to make visiting the boys' top 10 list as painless as possible. Considering that this was high tourist season and unusually hot for NYC, that was a tough assignment: how to avoid long lines and still cover the big deals, including Broadway, Statue of Liberty, Museum of Natural History, State Island Ferry, Central Park etc.\\nAs a former (but forever) New Yorker, i was most impressed that when we managed to lose the 8 year old, they helped us find him without making the parents feel that they should be turned over to social welfare officials!\\nThe hotel itself has everything --location, views, child-friendly restaurants, pool--that a family is looking for, but the staff make the difference between this place and another hotel with the same features. I booked a night at the Parker Meridien using priceline, and then went to the tripadvisor site to check out the reviews. What I read concerned me: there were many complaints about poor air conditioning, snooty service and questionable cleanliness.\\nFortunately none of those issues pertained to our stay. The check-in clerk was extremely nice and gave us a beautiful room on a high floor (even though we had scored a cheap rate through priceline.) The room was updated, immaculately clean and in perfect condition. Loved the flat-screen TV on the rotating pedestal. And it was definitely spacious for a New York City room. The weather that day was stiflingly muggy and the air conditioning worked great. (While it is true that you cannot adjust the temperature, the front desk gave us instructions on how to activate the fan.)\\nThe location can't be beat: two blocks from Central Park and walking distance to the Broadway district. Lots of great restaurants in the area as well. One caveat: Any \"extras\" are extremely expensive, so be very careful before you run up any guest charges. No need to dine at the hotel, as there are plenty of reasonably-priced options nearby. All in all, a perfect stay. THe conceriege gave us wonderful suggestions for dinner for both nights of our stay. Our front desk clerk took care of our reservations for the off site restaurants and for Normas (the in house restaurant we went for brunch). All of the restaurant suggestions were superb (I highly recommend The Rouge Tomate. Normas was excellent, but they don't serve mimosas or bloody mary's :( And, the burger bar was delicious!!\\nOur rooms were spacious and comfortable. The bathrooms were very spacious. I locked myself out of my room and the security were very patient and understanding. \\nThe only complaint I have is about the \"spa\" services. THe spa shouldn't even be considered a spa. It consists of two tiny little rooms with tiled floors (that have drainage holes in the middle of them for some reason.) Oh, and the bathroom is like a storage room where all kinds of junk is stored. So the spa like experience is diminished as soon as you have to pee before you get on the table. \\nThe facialist was nice enough, but there was no music and so it felt very clinical (the ipod dock was broken). The massage was the worse I had ever received. The guy was extremely sweaty and said some things that I thoguht were inappropriate. Nothing \"happened\", but the comments were enough to make me not go back. I just want to lay down and be peaceful, get a massage and go home. Is that so hard? I'd never go back to him. I might go back for the facial if there was music because I liked the way my skin and my boyfriend's skin look/felt afterwards. Check-in was quick and friendly. Location was wonderful, close to Central Park, Broadway, Radio City, and Times Square. The Burger Joint was delicious,but, very crowded. We had to eat in our room, as there was no where to sit. The room was comfortable. the bathroom has a great shower. The roof top deck was the best. The view of Central Park was wonderful. Everyone that works at the hotel, that we came in contact with was friendly, and had a smile. I took my 9 year old daughter to New York for a fun weekend. After a fun day of sight seeing and shopping we got back to our room and pulled back the bed spread. There was feces on the comforter, no kidding, it looked like someone had used it for toilet paper! I covered it up and shared the other bed with my daughter. It was too late to make a big deal, and I didn't want to do that in front of my daughter. The next morning when we checked out I made mention of to make sure the comforter was cleaned for the next guest. The desk person was horrified, and called the manager up and she was horrified also and offered her apology, and an up grade for our next visit. I guess she tried something, not much, but there are hundreds of hotels in NY I don't know why we would come back to this one. I travel a lot, never has anything like this happened. What kind of a cleaning policy does this place have that would allow this to happen? I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for two nights recently and have to say I am very surprised by some of the negative reviews the hotel has gotten. Some reviewers mention rude staff. All the staff I met was very friendly, from the check-in staff that was able to check us in early to the concierge that was very helpful. The location of the hotel could not be better. The one downside was, as some other reviewers also mentioned, that the AC in the room wasn’t all that powerful and you can’t change the temperature yourself. However overall, it was a very pleasant stay. We stayed at the Parker Meridien for 5 nights in June. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!! We upgraded to a high floor room with a view of Central Park. $50 extra per night. The view was great. And here's where the rest goes downhill:\\n1) The last night we were there I realized my nightgown was missing. I called security &amp; filed a report with lost &amp; found. By the time we checked out the following afternoon they still hadn't found it. When I talked with the front desk clerk I told her that the gentleman from security was friendly on the phone. She responded, \"That's because he's new here. Ha ha ha!\" Then she referred me to Andrew for further assistance. Andrew informed me that they had 90 days to find the nightgown. I asked him if at the end of the 90 day period they would compensate me for the lost nightgown. He immediately responded, \"Oh no! We don't have to give you anything!\" I asked him what the point of the 90 day period was. He had no idea. That was a super way to thank a Starwood Preferred guest for the 5 night stay. Since I left I've called the hotel 4 times. Every time I speak to someone different (thankfully not Andrew!) &amp; no one knows what I'm talking about &amp; then they tell me the nightgown hasn't turned up.\\n2) Our upgraded room's air conditioning didn't work. The first night we were fine. The second night all three of us - including our 9 year old - were so hot we could only sleep with a sheet. The thermostat indicated that if you want to change the temperature in the room you have to call engineering. We called the next day &amp; the individual who came to the room told us that the air conditioning was not broken &amp; then turned the thermostat down to 64.5 degrees. It remained there for the rest of the stay, and we perspired our way through each night. One day I ran into a hotel employee who wasn't very friendly. She quickly apologized &amp; said that it was just so hot in the hotel, she was having a hard time keeping her composure. I told her about the air conditioning in our room &amp; she replied, \"That's unacceptable. You must complain.\" We did. Nothing changed.\\n3) Several of the channels on the TV didn't work. Other guests on our floor asked us if we were having the same problem. Occasionally if you waited a while the program would appear, but this trick didn't always work.\\nThe staff in the bar were the nicest we met in the entire hotel. Despite being an actually nice hotel with great rooms, great placement and good prices... \\nI have to say a HUGE thumbs down. Le Parker has sent my email address and then sent a bunch of spam to me advertising their sister hotel in Palm Springs. I stay at Starwood hotels around the world... always top tier, and never in my life has a hotel exercised such amazingly bad judgment. \\nhttp://www.flyertalk.com/forum/starwood-preferred-guest/1102863-weird-mrs-p-we-believe-parker-meridien-spam-vertical-response.html#post14262096\\nI would not recommend this hotel to anyone until they clearly confess to their sins and fix this problem of massive consumer confidence and privacy!\\nP Have stayed here many times and each time was satisfying. The room prices have always been very competative for NYC. Central location is perfect for business and leisure. On the lucky occasion of getting a park view room the stay becomes very special. I stayed in the hotel for a week with my hubby who was in NY on business. The hotel is clean inside and out. The room (20th floor) was very spacious, king-size bed, with a TV, separate bathroom, sofa with a small table, desk and chair and room to hang clothes. The view from the hotel was ok, as with most hotels in this area, I think you will only get a view of another hotel and the tops of the trees from central park. The hotel is in great location, it has everything in walking distance. I would recommend you print a map from their website which I found really useful to plan my day or check where I was! The hotel is quite pricey if you use their other services, laundry, internet $16per day, room service etc. I wouldn’t recommend eating from here as there are so many cool and cheap places to eat around this hotel! The staff were really nice and helpful. We stayed for a weekend vacation in June 2010. The suite was clean, comfortable, and spacious for a NYC hotel. The location can't be beat. (Be sure to check out the burger joint in the lobby, and the rooftop pool is nice.)\\nHowever, upon check-in to our room we discovered a malfunctioning safe, a shower that wasn't working properly, and a disconnected TV. All were fixed, but they took some time. Then, on checkout we went to the bell captain who refused to get my car unless I went back up to the room and called him. Finally, as I walked out the door with my bags, I watched my car drive away. For the price, hiccups like this should not happen.\\nDespite this, I would likely return. Hopefully the kinks will be ironed out next time. We stayed at the Le Parker Meridien in June 2010 for 1 night. We used points for this stay and had even increased our points by 2500 to stay in a larger upgraded room with 2 double beds. When we checked in they told us that we had two twins and were offered a king. We told them we had upgraded the room and she rudely said-- only to a view room (which by the way was a sliver of the tree tops of central park). She said they were full and offered a king room with a roll away. We took the option as that is the only thing we could do at the time. The front desk was always unhelpful and unfriendly, as I had a package delivered--and went to inquire, She said it had been sent up----with no other information....again very rude. The package was not delivered to the room as she had said and I had to call to see where it was. After that it was delivered up to the room. \\nThe beds were also very uncomfortable --definitely not the Westin heavenly beds that we had been used to! \\nThe staff Norma's (rest. in hotel) at breakfast was the only good thing about the hotel. They were amazing and went out of their way to be helpful. \\nThe bar was always full and very small. \\nI also went to the business center to print boarding passes---the lady sitting at the desk rudely asked \"what are you here for?\" I told her to print boarding passes.....she then rudely pointed and said that there was a kiosk at the front desk to use and pointed that way....she said nothing else.\\nI would not stay at this hotel again. I travel to NYC frequently for work and always try to stay at LPM. While other hotels, independent of what floor you stay on, feel like you are going to be hit by a taxi or dumptruck because they are so loud, LPM is an oasis of calm upon entering. Staff is extremely professional, friendly, and attentive without being stuffy. The rooms are large by NYC standards and views of Central Park are excellent. Headed out to New York city and stayed one night at Le Parker Meridien; what a lousy hotel. Dip into your pocket for everything...$52 US to park a motorcycle overnight (compared to free at the Embassy Suites), $2 US to make a local phone call! I asked the parking manager (parking is run by the hotel) about the cost and he said they would charge full rate for a bicycle!) If you were paying full pop at $400 a night (booked ours through Hotwire for $132) you'd be sadly dissapointed at what you get. The room is clean but the entire hotel is dated and dreary. The bed was comfortable enough so as far as getting a good night's sleep goes, it scores okay there, but the lack of rate cards made us weary of doing anything for fear of paying through the nose at check-out. The front desk staff were friendly but not outgoing (i.e. they'd help you with check-in but weren't going out of their way to help). The room we had looked onto the back of several old apartment buildings 10 feet away...like I said...if you paid full price, you'd be very disappointed. Stay elsewhere! We traveled with children ages 8 and 10 and chose the hotel because it had a pool and was close to Carnegie Hall, Central Park, Time Square and many museums. We were thrilled beyond words! The hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. It is a child-friendly hotel but would be a super place to stay if you traveled without children. \\nThe children loved the cartoons in the elevators, the beautiful pool on top of the hotel and the Wii that was projected in the racquetball court. For adults, they have a wonderful work-out facility and spa and a great location! This was our first stay in New York with 3 young children. I picked this hotel because it was recommended by a guide book as being very suitable for families (style of rooms, pool, etc.).\\nOn the family front, I think it was the right pick. The kids loved the pool and it really helped to cool down in the heat. A combination of a junior suite and adjoining room gave good space for 5. The location near the park is excellent. Staff are very helpful. Plus the children did love cartoons in the lift.\\nHowever, I wouldn't necessarily choose it for a stay without kids. Why?\\n- it's not cheap. In fairness, there aren't a lot of larger hotels in the price range (we paid about $400 per room per night). There are much better hotels for 50% more or much worse for 30% less. But, if you don't rate a pool etc, you can get better for your money\\n- it's not very clean. Checking under the bed for lost toys wasn't pleasant\\n- extras (as others have said) are extortionately priced. Internet, gym are charged.\\n- rooms are a rather tired\\nOverall, think the other reviews are accurate. It just depends on what you value.\\nOne other thing - take care to check pool opening times. It is kid-friendly but I travelled back across the city to take the kids to the pool only to discover that it was closed so that 2 elderly ladies could take an exercise class. Even the concierge didn't seem to know about the closures (which happen for an hour or two most days). My wife and I spent an anniversary weekend here and had a terrific experience. The view from our room (Central Park) was a delight. The room itself was tasteful, with high quality furnishings, and a comfortable bed. There’s a coffee shop and bar in the lobby that we really enjoyed. High ceilings, first rate coffee, good cocktails and the comings-and-goings of a well heeled, somewhat international crowd. The staff at this hotel is terrific. They all seem happy to see you and happy to be in the hotel business (not always the case in NYC). Although we didn’t have any special needs during our stay, I’m certain these people would have gone out of their way to help us, if we’d needed it. I intend to stay here again on my next business trip to NY. Got this hotel for a good rate after bidding online. Stayed on a Sunday night over Memorial Day as a staycation away from Queens. Upon checking in at 5pm, we did start feeling nickel and dimed. After asking for a late check-out, we were told there was a \"promotion\" going on, where a 2pm checkout was $25 and 5pm was $50. Standard checkout time is noon, with 1pm complimentary. Not sure how an extra hour justifies a $25 fee, but we passed on this offer.\\nKing sized room was clean and stark. Both sides of the bed had the blueish reading lights. Bathroom had decent water pressure, and lots of counter space. The breakfast menu was extremely overpriced, $28 for the standard eggs/bacon breakfast.\\nPool area was nice, a touch smaller than expected. On a holiday sunday and monday, there were lots of kids in the pool. A nice twist were the plentiful pool noodles provided. View from the rooftop was decent as well, but not quite providing the wow-factor for this native NY-er. Must've been because there were a lot of buildings between the park and the pool.\\nNorma's restaurant (at least our 5th trip here) seemed to fall a little flat compared to prior visits. The menus online were inconsistent with the ones we were given at the restaurant. However, they were pretty frequent on the free OJ refills, which should be expected for $9 a glass.\\nOverall this was a decent stay that we would return to just for the pool - although I would balk at paying their standard $269/night rates. Beautiful and clean hotel. My friend and I stayed there for 4 days and 3 nights during Memorial Day weekend. I had a wonderful time there, we were satisfied on all levels at this hotel. The staff was amazing from the second we got through the doors until the second that we left. The housekeepers were also very nice and so polite. The concierge desk was very helpful in providing us with important information on how to get around, especially Rafael who was there in the evenings. We recommend this hotel on so many levels and we were very impressed!!!!\\nThank you everyone at the Meridien Hotel. We frequently stay at Westin properties and really enjoyed our night at Le Parker Meridien. The staff were friendly and we had a pleasant suprise that we were upgraded to a superior room. Our room on the 26th floor appeared to have been recently rennovated. The bed and bedding was comfortable and soft. We both woke up relaxed from a great night's sleep.\\nUnlike other New York properties where we've stayed, we didn't have any disburbing street noise. The hotel is a couple of blocks off Central Park and a 10 block walk or $6 cab to the heart of Times Square.\\nThe hotel itself was beautifully appointed and we're still trying to figure out how the elevator made it to the 26th floor so quickly. We did peak at the rooftop swimming pool and will have to go back sometime to try it.\\nWe have a new favorite hotel in New York. I stayed at the Parker Meridien (sorry, it sounds weird to say \"le\" before English words... like \"le FDR Drive\") over a bridge weekend in NY. I hadn't stayed here before. The lobby was packed, and the hotel was completely booked, but the check-in process was efficient, if not effusive. I had booked a Jr. Suite, and the front-desk clerk told me I had been upgraded... to a Jr. Suite. I didn't understand, until I realized that there are about a dozen different room types in the hotel, and he had put me in a tower room. OK, so far so good. The room was on the small side, and no closing door between the sitting room and the bedroom (I sleep better w/ two doors between me and the hallway). The big swiveling TV / room-divider was pretty cool... in the 80s. But these are pretty minor gripes -- the room was spotlessly clean, reasonably attractive and had a really good shower.\\nI spent the weekend mostly hanging out midtown, near the hotel. I skipped the hotel breakfast -- the restaurant was jam-packed and loud -- and went to le Pain Quotidien (see, that sounds normal) on 7th and 58th. The neighborhood is great for upscale shopping, upscale eating, upscale people-watching, etc. \\nI worked out in the gym downstairs -- free for Starwood Platinum, $10 otherwise -- and this was the first nice surprise. It's a real gym -- a big one -- like the one I belong to in SF. So I could do a normal workout. I could have taken a spin class too. I also booked a massage in the spa -- great massage, nice-but-basic spa.\\nSo, a very nice experience, on the whole. Minor gripe: really-really tiny lobby bar, so I always felt like I had to go somewhere else for a drink. Also, while I know Manhattan is expensive (duh) I felt like I paid for exactly what I got -- which is fair, of course, but I guess I've gotten spoiled by getting upgraded to really nice suites with park views and still paying for a regular room. The room I booked (with a corporate discount) was $450/night. Normally it would have been about $600. The room I stayed in normally goes for about $800/night. I paid $279 for two nights for a room with 2-double beds (via the Starwood website). It was a fair price, but in hind sight I wouldn't pay a ton more money. The location is unbeatable - quick walk to Central Park, high end shopping and Time Square. The hotel itself is beautiful and the pool/roof top view is amazing. The staff was really friendly and quick when answering questions. \\nThe draw backs would be the beds. Comfortable, but their using European doubles which are much smaller than American sizing. The pressure in the shower was really weak. I made a 4-minute phone call to a 267 number and it was $19.54 USD. Ouch for calling a local cell phone. They seemed really concerned with having 4 people in a room with double beds. They didn't charge us extra, but gave me the impression it wasn't going to be enjoyable or permitted. \\nSome people commented on the room temperature - didn't notice any problems. Also, I noticed other comments around fees for extra glasses etc. We ordered extra towels, glasses &amp; pillows and zero charges were against our account.\\nOverall, good amenities and location and I'd go back...but it doesn't present a ton of value in my opinion. Based on the room rate of $350 before tax I expected better. Aside from the lobby which is exquisite the hotel looks dated. The big rotating TV stand in the middle of the room didn't help matters, and all it really did was take up space. Not to mention this is the first hotel I've stayed at in a couple of years that didn't have a flat screen in the room. Sun deck has nice veiws but the astro-turf and lawn furniture could use an upgrade. Hotel does not recognize SPG status, despite being a SPG hotel, which made the check-in process more unpleasant than expected, as there is no semblance of order at the front desk. The hotel has definitely left its glory days in the past, but is still in moderate condition, although greatly in need of a refresh. The cartoons playing in the elevators add a trashy vibe. Were other SPG hotels available on short notice, I would have certainly not even bothered with this place It was a treat to have a short stay at the Le Parker Meridien in NYC. The room was beautiful and the service excellent. From Michael at the front desk to the house keeper on my floor, I was given 5 star treatment. Plus, the cartoons in the elevator actually made me wish for extra stops. Kuddos and great job to the staff. I cannot wait to stay there on my next trip. Le Parker Meridien is a perfect location for tourists and business travelers. It's close to Central Park, Times Square, and right next to a subway stop. The staff were very friendly on check-in and check-out. High speed internet was very fast. Best of all is the fitness center - two floors with plenty of treadmills, exercise bikes, weight room, and more. I'll definitely be going back. \\nThe rates can get pricey depending on the season so it's not always the best value. If you can get this hotel for under $300 per night, you should definitely book it. Lovely stay for 2 nights for 2 native New Yorkers in need of two nights away. While we both work in the city it was great to have one work day morning w/out a commute and two 'date nights' out on the town. Our room was so quiet you could not hear a thing from other rooms/hallway/above/below/elevator and we are used to fine hotels. The service was first rate including Darius @ the front desk (Dominican Republic and a reader of our publication El Diario La Prensa so we made friends fast!). Down the st is a cute cuban place and \"Thom Thom\" Korean where I enjoyed a solo glass of champagne, spicy tofu soup and a quite moment of reflection. While the \"Burger Joint\" is a big draw, we skipped that in favor of pizza @ Big Nicks on Bway and breakfast @ Norma's...thank you! Spent two nights at the Parker Meridien for business in April -- both were outstanding. No problems with upgrades as I am a Starwood Platinum, but the staff was friendly and polite regardless. Location great for walking pretty much anywhere in midtown. I left an award behind in the closet -- didn't realize until I got home -- called security and housekeeping. They found it two days later and FedEx'd it to my office. Glad they found it, but the extra points go for them already having my address and contact information already on file when they picked up the phone. Le Parker Meridien brings you comfort, luxury, superb food, and good old-fashioned fun!\\nWhen was the last time you caught a Looney Toon or Popeye cartoon? No fear, just take\\nthe elevator and catch up on some classic cartoons! Instant comfort and some chuckles\\ntoo. Entering Le Parker Meridien is luxury at it's best! Arches, columns, service, gorgeous\\nbar at night / coffee bar by day, and gourmet treats for breakfast, to the best burger you ever\\ndid taste! The rooms are decorated just right, stocked refrigerators, the suites have inviting\\nseating areas, and the showers are big, and beautiful. Don't let me forget the staff, they are\\nso pleasant and the atmosphere is so friendly! After staying at several top NYC hotels, Le\\nParker Meridien is the stand-out hands down! I love this hotel, mostly because I am SPG gold and always get a park view on a high floor, and I am fascinated by the view of the park from the outdoor roof - same view you would pay $20 a person for with thousands of others on the top of the rock. Other positives - it is insanely clean. I encountered someone vacuuming and polishing the elevator more than once during my stay. Recently, the hotel began charging $50 a night for your pet - which I thought was a bit steep considering it was free 3 months ago. The prices for food and in room service are downright insane. Breakfast in your room runs close to $50 a person after the taxes and service charges - I honestly don't know how you can ask for that with a straight face, but the room itself is large, clean, and the bed is extraordinarily comfortable. A make-over is probably needed soon to get rid of the bulky swiveling CRT TV that takes up a huge portion of the room, but I don't watch TV anyway so I'm not that impressed with other hotels flat panel TVs that don't get an HD signal 90% of the time anyway. The service has dropped off a bit from a year ago when I stayed here, but I still got what I needed - it just wasn't as courteous. I stayed at the Le Parker Meridien, earlier this week, and it was 'ok.' First of all, the location is great and I did find the rooms really interesting (if small) and quiet. But, there were a few flaws. Everyone mentioned that the rooms are hot and I cant stress this enough. Miserable hot. I called down to have an engineer 'fix this' (per the sign on the thermostat) but no one ever came. The extra 10 dollars for the gym was steep, but worth it. Great gym. But, going back to an 80+degree room is gross! I also thought it was strange that the restaurant (toted as the best breakfast in NYC) doesnt open until 7. When you travel for business, you often have to eat breakfast before 7 so that was kind of lame. \\nOh and one other thing happened: The cleaning folks put moisturizer in the shower instead of conditioner (i.e. I got two bottles of lotion and no conditioner). A lot of you all wouldnt care about this, but I have to say: that sucked. I put a full bottle of lotion in my hair (of course, it is my fault that I didnt catch it before pouring). Just sort of sucks that the cleaning people didnt catch that. Lesson learned.... This is a fine hotel - decent sized rooms, good location, and comfortable enough. What made me think less of this place was the fact that they charge you for everything (a tooth brush, gym, extra glasses, etc) and many of their prices are pricey. I was on a business trip and was considering ordering room service after a long work day - even though everything was being covered by my employer but I still had a hard time ordering basic (hotel) food for such high prices. Had a great overnight stay here. The junior suite was more spacious than I would have expected for NYC. Bed was very comfortable. Service was good. I would return!\\nMake sure you get a burger at the Burger Joint in the lobby. One of the best burgers I've ever had! The good points:\\nI have stayed here a number of times during business trips to NYC.It is a great location not too far to walk to most Midtown meetings and close to Central Park and Lincoln Center .Very good size rooms by New York standards and most of all they are light (I hate the dark Edwardian hotels where you can't see to read ) .\\nThe bad points\\nEverything is extra-$16 a day for internet access,$10 for every visit to the gym .Call me a cheapskate but even on business expenses I'm not prepared to pay their prices for breakfast so just grab something from Starbucks opposite\\nHowever the thing that really grated was being stuck here for 5 days due to it being impossible to get back to Europe due to the volcanic ash problem .The room rate crept from the initial pre booked (and admittedly therefore discounted ) rate up to $399 a night ,then $569 ,then they wanted $619 and only by going on the internet to prove they had rooms at $569 did they reluctantly agree to reduce the rate .I know this is the market in operation and my choice was to simply check out and go to the Marriott but when you're spending hours on the phone and net simply trying to find a way home it wasn't someting I wanted to do-so I experienced Starwood greed in operation .\\nFinally I know this is New York but my room (on the 20th floor ) suffered from a huge amount of outside noise-i never had one uninterrupted night sleep all the time i was there.\\nI think the time has come for me to exercise my consumer rights and vote with my feet on my next new York visit We stayed 4 nights in a Jr Suite with two adults and two young children. Our room was comfortable and fit our family well. There seem to be no perks for a gold status guest, though we did get a late check out without a problem.\\nFrom the check-in to the check-out the staff was great. The pool seemed small at first but our family had a great time in it. I would not recommend it for lap swimming. Also, the pool was uncomfortably cold one morning. Even the kids found it too cold to swim in.\\nThe room was stuffy at times. I recommend turning the thermostat down to 67 and leaving it on. I did notice a difference when I did that one night. I learned that it's a mistake to turn off the fan. Our room was very quiet. I did not hear any noise from the hallway and the street noise was minimal (we were on the 33rd floor).\\nWe did not eat at the hotel. Instead we got breakfast at the markets and Starbucks nearby. Restaurants worth trying within a block are Remi, Redeye Grill, and Beacon. Let me begin by saying that the staff at Le Parker Meridien and the services they provide are top notch. From the momenet we stepped into the awesome lobby, we were treated like guests should be treated. The efficient and kind staff as well as the clean modern lines of the hotel's decor made it worth every penny I would be spending. Or so I thought.\\nBefore I get into what I think is wrong with the heart of the matter is, let me list the good things: \\n-The lobby and the three \"restaurants\" that inhabit there; Erma's is fab for breakfast through lunch. The Burger Joint allowed for a late supper that reminded me of all the better parts of the late 70's and early 80's with great burgers, fries and shakes. The newer bar area off the lobby reminds me of a Moorish tea joint and had great munchies and drinks late into the night. \\n-The staff. I won't drag this out. Quite honestly, I only stay at 4 and 5 star hotels. The Parker staff could teach lessons on how hoteliers should treat valued guests.\\n-The pool and gym were worth the effort. Especially for Mid-Town.\\nNow the problem: I have read that others have faced this as well. Our room, on a very high floor or the Parker, was clean and modern. Well kept and tidy, thanks to a crack housekeeping staff. \\nNo, what makes the entire trip difficult is the room TEMPERATURE.\\nI understand, after speaking off the record to the engineer for the hotel that this is an on-going problem ever since the re-model some years ago. Case in point: Our room had an electronic thermostat. It obviously had a power supply of some sort, but it quite simply was not connected to any mechanism that allowed cool air to enter our room. I had it turned down to 58 degrees F. Nothing. I was able to force the window open past the 4 inch mark so that cooler air could enter the room and keep it reasonable so that we could sleep. Even so, my portable alarm clock that registers temperature (correctly, I might add), showed it to be 85 degrees F at midnight. This is simply unacceptable.\\nDear powers that be for Le Parker Meridien, please solve this before my next visit. MAKE SURE THE TEMPERATURE CAN BE SET BY THE GUEST SO THAT THEY CAN REMAIN COMFORTABLE. JUST PUTTING A STICKER ON THE THERMOSTAT ADVISING TO CALL THE FRONT DESK MAKES NO SENSE IF THE AIR CONDITIONER SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK! IF SO, I WILL RETRACT THIS REVIEW AND POST A FAR MORE GLOWING ONE INSTEAD. PLEASE, I BEG OF YOU. i usually recommend this hotel for guests when they come to visit me in NYC. My mom usually stays here when she comes. First, it's comfortable, clean, fairly spacious for NYC, has some sort of style and personality. It has just enough style for out of town guests without them feeling uncomfortable or out of their element. the views from the windows aren't great, but whatever. it's better than staying at your typical Marriott hotel.\\nsecond, the location. it's in midtown and a couple blocks away from central park. centrally located. close enough to times square but far enough away from it so you don't have to be part of the tourist trap riff raff. closer to the stores on 5th avenue and madison than anything else which is nice.\\nthird, there are two good restaurants in the hotel...norma's and Burger Joint. both are NY experiences and fun places to take guests. burger joint is literally a joint. a diner atmosphere in a fancy hotel. but the burgers are good. really good. we go there when we're in the neighborhood. norma's just serves breakfast and i can go there only about once a year because it's really too much food and by that time I've forgotten how indulgent it is.\\nfourth...a swimming pool and outdoor terrace!!! this is a rare amenity for NY and a hidden perk of this hotel. the pool is covered by a glass roof but it is still amazing and you can see central park from it. so this is the perk, i get to swim when my mom comes and visits.\\ni know everyone complains about \"noise\" in NYC and you might hear some in your room, but this is NYC! you are going to hear it regardless. it's just what you sign up for. Stayed here twice. Got ripped off twice. Everything costs. Had to pay $7 to have some glasses delivered to the room. Unbelievably they don't tell you till you get there that their \"double beds\" are actually \"oversized twins\" — nowhere near big enough for a couple to sleep comfortably. They provide a huge coffee table book about the \"history of childhood\" in each room — but there's no coffee machine! I forgot my toothbrush, most hotels would give you one gratis, not here, they want to sell you a kit for $10. The bar is ridiculously expensive and uncomfortable — but has a beautiful ceiling. And worst of all you can't control the heat in your room, you have to call an engineer — who took the screws out the window to open as it was too hot. A Starwood disgrace. The Le Parker Meridien is a one of the smaller hotels in the area. Located one block south of Central Park and next door to Carnegie Hall, the passer-by would miss the hotel unless knowing its exact location. \\nOur week long stay had some ups and downs. Location and proximity to the Metro were perfect. Walking distance to several other attractions were also a plus. \\nThe room was fully modernized and offered everything for a family, even one that planned on spending little time at the hotel. \\nOur only mention would be the food offered at the restaurant. Norma's, the main restaurant, served a great breakfast. Omelettes, pancakes and orange juice for three came to $130.00. While I had three refills on the OJ, I'd love to find the justification for such a price. Needless to say, with all the great, authentic diners surrounding the hotel, Norma's is probably a main source of income for the hotel. A second restaurant, with no discernible name, but was rumored to offer some of the best hamburgers in the city, was inaccessible due to the long lines that formed by late morning and remained until evening. \\nOtherwise, I would highly recommend and return to this hotel. It services a variety of people. My wife saw Rachel Welch walk to her car several times while doing a morning talk show. The sense that other celebrities were staying there, along side the average tourist, was evident, but kept subtle by the staff. \\nThe bar area is done in a Middle Eastern style with great service at more reasonable prices. \\nThe staff was able to field any request and, other than the slow bell hop service at check-out (to their credit, the hotel was sold out), the stay was carefree and in an ideal location for our site seeing. \\nA hotel for the business traveler and family vacation (as well as Rachel Welch). I love this place. Great location, comfortable rooms, great beds. Norma's restaurant is an asset as well, if you are willing to pay through the nose for breakfast. Upper floors have postcard views of central park. Not as stylish as it aspires to be, and will underwhelm those looking for something akin to Parker Palm Springs. Still, a very solid option for business or pleasure in NYC. My boyfriend and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 2 nights in March 2010. This was my second stay at the hotel, and it was the second time I have left New York satisfied. The location can't be beat. It is within walking distance to Central Park, TImes Square, Madison Square Garden, etc. The lobby is immaculate and service is quick to assist with check in and luggage. I was upgraded for being a Starwood Preferred Guest, and the room was minimal, stylish, and spacious. It may not be to some peoples' liking, but I prefer chic to gaudy. The bathroom is a bit worn, as well as some of the fixtures in the room, but only if you look close. The bed is soo comfortable, and the decor is fresh. Do not even think about ordering room service, it is outrageously expensive, as is Norma's, the restaurant with renowned breakfast (way overpriced and NOT very good.) Overall, great hotel, as is the whole Meridien chain. I've stayed in NYC Starwood hotels many times and during crowded peak seasons, but I've never had such disappointing service -- reservation mix-up, room not ready at 5pm, someone walking into our room (while we were in it) with a key thinking thinking they were checking into THEIR room, and frustrating long waits for check-in, elevators, getting someone on the phone, waiting for the car. Beds were not as comfortable as the Westin and W hotels.\\nOn a more positive note, as a platinum member we got a 4pm check out and free wireless internet. Our junior suite was nice, and our daughter said the fold-out couch was comfortable. Location is nice, too, near Central Park and 5th Ave shopping. Stayed at the Parker Meridien in March and as ever very reliable. Quick, friendly check in. Larger than average rooms for New York with a nice view over the park. Great location straight onto main Avenues and a quick walk to Time Square. The bar is always good and this time we tried the burger bar that is always busy. Good burgers if a bit pricey! I appreciated the friendly service of the staff, from the people behind the front desk to the cleaning lady to the luggage boys. The location of the hotel is good, close to 5th Avenue, Central Park and Times Square. We had an wonderful experience at Le Parker Meridien in New York City. Even before our arrival, we experienced superior service. I had booked the room on the website at the regular rate, but realized later that I had enough Starwoods Preferred guest points to cash in for an award night. So I called the hotels, revenue office to find out if I could switch my reservation from cash to points. The person that I spoke with was excellent (I can't remember his name...maybe Jason?) He was very helpful and stayed on the line with me and the central reservation office until the sithover was complete. Thanks!\\nWhen we arrived at the hotel on the day of check-in, we were please to find that the property was modern and well appointed. I had alerted the hotel staff that we were celebrating our anniversary when I made the reservation and they pulled out all the stops to ensure that we had a great stay. From the time we arrived, every employee that we interacted with wished us a happy anniversary. Then, not 30 minutes after we got to our room, we received a lovely platter of chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate truffles with a nice note congratulating us on our anniversary. We both LOVE chocolate, so it was a welcomed treat :)\\nOur room was great. It was located on the 37th floor and we had a totally unobstructed view of Central Park. We sat in the window seat for almost an hour admiring the view. The hotel is conveniently located for anyone travelling to New York to experience the theatre and other attractions. It was not far from Broadway (a short cab ride of about $6) or from an array of well known restaurants. We went to the classic French Restaurant La Grenouille, which was excellent. All in all, we had a great time in New York and a memorable experience at Le Parker Meridien. As a Starwoods member, I was upgraded with a view of the Park. It was such a treat at such an affordable rate. I would go back in a minute. Physically and by location not a bad hotel. However, when we went to checkout we were presented with a bill that significantly exceeded in price the quote I had obtained from them online. They said they were charging an additional $30/night for a rollaway bed for my child even though my online receipt clearly listed 3 guests as well as detailed other charges which did not include the bed charge. Other gripes: expensive internet access, a stiff additional fee to use the exercise facility, and a room so hot I had trouble sleeping- and with no temperature controls in the room. We had a great time at this hotel, not far from central Park and 5th avenue. The suite was well furnished and spacious. We had a great burger at the Burger joint downstairs, it was a nice surprise. Apparently it has the best gym in America but we didn't have time to go. It should be open 24h I think. The rooftop pool was a disappointment however, too small and crowded. The cartoons in the elevators are a fun touch. Service was without reproach. My husband and I stayed at the Parker for 3 nights for his 40th birthday and we wern't disappointed. We checked in at the front desk with Andrew who was super friendly and upgraded us to a Central Park view room because we have SPG. The view was sweeping, the room was clean and nicely appointed and very quiet. The housekeeping staff kept our room made up and tidy and changed our sheets the third night.\\nThe burger joint has a great burger but pricey ($29 for two burgers, two fries, and two Diet Cokes) but we were in an out quickly. The proximity to Central Park is handy and we had our friends come to our hotel to celebrate at Nave, the coffee/bar bar after taking a bike ride through the park...the drinks are expensive but we ordered a bottle of Veuve champagne for only $100. We also spotted a movie star relaxing at the next table! Check out was easy. We left our charger plugged in next to the bed, told security, and they quickly went to retrieve it for us! We will definitely make the Parker our hotel again and again for many years to come. Our family of four stayed here for three nights - two rooms side by side. The location is perfect for Midtown sightseeing and shopping. Close to Central Park as well. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were a good size - enough rooms for family to visit us and hang out in the room during endless rain storms. Very clean and quiet all day and night. Too bad we couldn't empty the minibar and use it as a fridge. The pool was great for kids to swim at all hours. Never too crowded. We splurged and had breakfast at Norma's our last day - it was fantastic! At $140 for four, not an everyday thing, but worth it at least once. Also loved the Burger Joint hidden away in the lobby - worth the crowds for a quick burger. \\nA few minor complaints. The parking was over $50 per day which seems crazy, but may be typical for NYC. There is a charge of $16 for wireless or wired internet access, which is ridiculous for a hotel in this category. Motel 6 provided free internet for heavens sake! The room key cards are an odd elongated shape which makes it hard to fit them in a pocket. \\nOverall, a great place for a family to stay in NYC. Staying in the hotel right now. Want to write something before I forgot. We booked a junior suite. Room is clean and the size is acceptable. However, there is no coffee machine, or tea bag. They have a mini bar so that they are telling you if you want something to drink, pay (or eat the ice :P). I want to find out how much the services are, but there is no booklet or whatever. I asked the front desk and the gentlemen has no clue. \\nThe worst is the beds. The sofa bed is horrible. I know how it feels to sleep on the sofa bed, but it should not be that BAD... I lay down on the bed and my body almost flip because the middle part of the bed almost collaspe. This is just unacceptable. The king bed is not any better. The middle part of the bed is also going down. \\nIn general, my experience with front desk is pretty nice. But with housekeeping is horrible. I made a few request during my stay. The first night, I asked them to set up the sofa bed for me. I think I had wait until I fell asleep and then I called after 30 minutes and finally somebody came. The second time I request a sewing kit and waited for 20 minutes again. When I call the next time, another person told me the hotel has no sewing kit! The whole communicatin process is so weird to me. I am not sure if I am talking to the housekeeping department when I call but definitely they didn't hear my request. The thid time, I decided to get an extra bed and sheet to sleep on another bench since the sofa bed is so horrible. I requested the bed sheet around 10:30, and same thing happened, did not hear anything at 11:30. Then, I called again and tell them i can even go down to get the sheet. The front desk girl was apologetic, but it doesn't mean that will make me stay up longer. Finally, the housekeeper came around 11:30. She handed me the stuff, but there is no sheet!! Gladly I know where their place is and chase after immediately. Otherwise, I have to wait another hour. \\nAll in all, if this happen in red roof inn or super 8 (no offense to these two motels), I understand. But this is still Le Meridien, a Starwood Property. Based on other people's review. If you want to stay in a hotel that is better and comparable in terms of price, maybe Park Central would be a good choice. Where do I start? With the fact that I stayed 3 nights prepaid and they put a $300 pending charge on my credit card? Really? No one has ever done that before and I thought it was a bit much.\\nAlso, you have to pay outrageous rates to use their facilities that they advertise so heavily--to use (to walk in-nothing special) the gym it's $10/day, the internet is `$18/day and the business center charges you $8/min for internet use. \\nBut, to top it all off, the hotel rooms don't have their own heat/air units. It's on a central system so there's no way for you to cool your room if it's too hot if they are currently running the heat. Wtf? The concierge told me that they could arrange to have my window opened. It was raining and I had a toddler with me in my 20th floor room. Are you serious? It was so hot I had a lot of trouble even sleeping. Also, the hotel desk staff (including the concierge) seem to just not care at all about helping their guests. Very apathetic, actually. I would stay away--for the money there are many other better hotels in Midtown Manhattan. I stayed at the Parker Meridien for a combination of business &amp; leisure, and was given a room with a great view of Central Park. The room was very spacious for New York standards, comfortable beds, clean bathroom with quality toiletries. Location is great, easy to get to where-ever you want to go. Nice buzzy atmosphere in the adjoining restaurant downstairs (can't remember the name), and the burger joint in the lobby is also a great alternative for room service. I would happily stay here again. I \"Pricelined\" this hotel and my bid of $175 was accepted. I think I could have done even better but I was still happy with that price. We checked in late Saturday night and left early Sunday morning. Check in was quick and easy, the room was fine, nothing special, nice toiletries, clean. My only complaint that was I couldn't lower the temperature in the room, despite what appeared to be an adjustable thermostat. I think it's locked in place and you have to call to get them to change it because there was a note posted to that effect. The room was very warm and I couldn't sleep well at that temperature. I could have called for help, and it even seemed like the windows might have opened, but I didn't try. Overall, for a NYC hotel, the price plus convenience of the location were excellent! Lovely hotel, great views, attentive staff, good location. One big drawback was the pool. It has a great view and the staff assured me the water was clean, and that the pool had just undergone a big maintenance, but the orange plastic rope divider across the pool was full of black yucky stains and made me wonder about the cleanliness of the water. It was surprising, given the attention paid to other details in the rooms and public areas. This is a no frills hotel and is a good value if you can get in for under $300 a night (which I did). If I had to pay more than that, I would go elsewhere.\\nPositives:\\nIt has clean lines, modern but not upscale decor, and a good location in midtown. The rooms are about average sized. The bathrooms are clean and well maintained (however are on the smaller size, you basically have to step over the toilet to get into the shower). Tom and Jerry playing on the elevator TV is amusing. Elevator wait is relatively short. There is an uncrowded Starbucks right across the street. The hotel has entrances on both 56th and 57th streets, which is convenient.\\nNegatives:\\nNot a great check in and room assignment experience. I am a Starwood elite and reserved a king size bed. I was told at check in they were sold out of king beds and I could only get a two bed room. The beds were tiny -- smaller than full size, closer to twin. Although comfortable, they are platform beds (no boxspring and you are close to the ground). The check in persons were not particularly friendly and never once apologized for not having the room I had reserved. They also appear to have a pretty disorganized check in in system. They use these ancient Mac laptops at the front desk to process the check ins, and they are very slow. There was no concierge at the front door, anywhere to be found, both times I tried to get a taxi (it wasn't difficult to get one, but there was no help). Old style Sony Trinitron television sets in the rooms. No morning newspaper or morning coffee. I'll try and make this short and sweet as the concierge gave off the vibe that her guests should be that way. . \\nThe best thing about the LPM is its location. Plain and simple. Rates for a $300+ per nite stay.. you could do better. The check-in was fine and bell staff were courteous. But, it seemed like the few times I asked about basic 'getting around' information to the concierge you sensed they were either not interested or tired of talking to guests. I can understand they get mundane and asked the same ?s all the time. But, where is professionalism? I asked a question in a polite way and told \"didn't you ask me this question before\"...w/o letting me finish my ? to learn that it wasn't the same question. Regardless, replies like that just made me feel this hotel is not worth my stay. This is in addition, to the fact, that my room, though overall on the surface looked ok, had peeling paint on the shower ceiling....not good. I'm glad that I didn't explore more b/c who knows how much dust and guck were around chairs, closets, rugs, and the desk!!! Plus, I don't like being charged $10 for an on-site gym and oh, there's another charge to use the small racquetball court w/ b-ball net. Finally, you're better off going to a nearby FEDEX Kinko's to use the internet vs. their overpriced business center. There are other hotels out in NYC that earn your hard earned money!!!! Le Parker Meridien was absolutely all I could expect and more. I was more than satisfied with the cleanliness of the hotel along with its luxurious amenities and accessories. The concierge was incredibly helpful, as were the people I spoke with at the check-in desk. I hope the hotel doesn't change the next time I visit. I admit that I am one of those people who loves NYC yet I can still be impressed. Can it get any better? Yes, stay at the Meridien! The recipe for a memorable stay in NYC. Start with a great location -- a short cab ride from Penn Station. Close to Broadway theaters, restaurants, shopping and Central Park. Add a welcoming ambience from the street and into lobby. Mix in some luxury but give it clean lines and a hip Euro vibe. Cartoons on the elevator. Nothing stuffy about this hotel. Thai fusion and milkshakes at 2 am. A view of Central Park that would bring tears to Olmsted's eyes! Put it all together with Incredible service -- open, friendly but not overly familiar and then you have a fantastic stay in NY. Regrets...a few... I never made it back up to the penthouse pool (yes there's a swimming pool 40 something stories about the city -- and the crowd at the lobby restaurant kept me away. Okay so that means I have to go back soon! We recently stayed here with two of our teenage sons on a 5-day trip to NYC.\\npro's\\n* great concierges (Thanks Fernanda for all your efforts'really splendid)\\n* location (however, there are obviously lots of other hotels in every pricerange around here)\\n* sublime (and thus pricy, but who cares; \"when in Rome.....\") breakfast at Norma's!\\n* friendly staff\\n* good beds and pillows!\\n* reasonably well sized rooms. (forget about the view on Central Park, perhaps only the very highest floors do have limited view on Central Park; the rest is looking at bricks and windows from other buildings)\\ncons\\n* nice to make the fact very known that yoiu have a pool on the 42nd floor, but when it's out of order due to maintenance for over a week, guests would like to be informed IN ADVANCE!!! (especially if they booked your hotel just because of this pool) Giving a voucher for a hotelpool a couple of blocks away does not do the trick here. \\n* we would have appreciated it to have rooms where wc, sink, minibar (needs to be cold instead of hot, or am I mistaken here) and windows are operating correctly (especially if you claim to be a 5-star hotel). A paintbrush here and there would not hurt either.\\n* being out of adaptors for a couple of days and then finally giving a wrong adaptor? OK, us Europeans should obviously have brought ourr own one, but still a pitty in service..\\n* we're those guests who like to have their room/beds made before 5PM.\\nHowever, an average hotel on an excellent locaton. If you can book a nice package you get reasonable good value for money. That's if this hotel and its management are prepared to follow up on some of the criticism on a.o. this site. This was the first experience of my family in the big apple. It was a trip that our child desired to visit the city of \"Spiderman\". We started having already planned part of the cultural visits, but the first great surprise was that, thanks to a chat we had with the hotel concierge that great connoisseur of the city gave us the most important indicator to enjoy the city at its best. The hotel is strategically located in the heart of Manhattan, and from here it is possible reach anywhere in the city in no time. The Junior Suite assigned statan extremely convenient for travelers like us with a child. Cleaning and impeccable attention to detail throughout the hotel. To save time, like good Italians, we had a quick breakfast at the bar with fragrant \"croassants\" and italian cappuccino. One regret ... have never been able to enjoy the snack bar of the Hotel, which boasts the best hamburgers in the city, as we have always found endless queues ... be a reason to return to New York. The view from the wonderful rooftop pool is breathtaking. Too bad we spent only one week in NYC. My daughter and I stayed here to celebrate her 15th birthday by seeing a few shows, museums, etc. Great staff. Loved the staff at the Burger Joint - the best burgers at the best price in NYC. Fantastic water pressure in the shower. AND they take Starwood points. We're here every year for a conference and we tend to spend a few extra days in the city so we can play and run amok. This year, we discovered that LPM accepted Starwood points - SCORE! Bye-bye NY Sheraton, we liked you but it's time to try a new neighborhood. \\nAfter reading several reviews specifically calling out the fact that you should ask for the new tower, we did just that when we made our reservations. Checking in, we received one of the big bummers of the experience, the hotel key card. The thing is twice as long as a normal credit card and therefore impossible to keep in a wallet - truly, one of those little things like a paper cut that become huge. It was a serious pain in the rear to try to store the darn thing when we weren't in our room. LPM, make the keys a normal size! NOW! \\nTo offset the grouchiness that the abnormal key card invoked, once we entered the elevators we discovered that LPM had a sense of humor, showing cartoons in the elevators. Depending on which car you rode in, you could see Charlie Chaplin, Tom &amp; Jerry or classic cartoons such as Droopy. \\nWe rode to the 37th floor chuckling at the antics of Tom &amp; Jerry and upon exiting on our floor were stopped at the sight of the amazing view of Central Park to the left. Just gorgeous. Off to find our room, we were pleasantly surprised that we were on the side of the hotel facing Central Park and thus our room had the same amazing view out a big picture window. Nice. \\nThe room itself is relatively spacious for a New York City hotel room. We brought P90X DVDs with us and were able to both workout comfortably in-room. Also, know that you can rent a fridge for your room if you're so inclined. Since we were there for a week, it was money well-spent. Carnegie deli tastes just as good over several meals in-room! \\nOverall, very happy with the hotel and we will be returning next year. Good show, Le Parker Meridien. My husband, son and I stayed at this Le Meridien for seven nights, combining business and vacation. Positives:\\n* Midtown location was convenient and within walking distance to Time Square theaters, museums, and Central Park.\\n* Our room faced a courtyard (possibly an alley). From the 18th floor we couldn't see the ground. But this inward facing room was extremely quiet, a rarity for NYC.\\n* Once we found it, the blackout shade made it easy to sleep late in the morning. \\n* Pillows were pretty good. Two feather &amp; two composite type.\\nNegatives:\\n* The first night we were awakened by loud knocking on our door at about 3:30 am. I peeked through the security hole &amp; I'm pretty sure a hooker was standing at my door. I told her to go away as she was checking her phone. I informed front desk who said a guard was on duty in the lobby. \\n* The bed felt like a futon. It was a fairly hard mattress on a wood platform, with no box spring. There was a featherbed topper on the mattress. After sleeping on this for a week my hips &amp; knees were killing me.\\n* The maid did NOT clean the toilet the whole time we were there, except possibly to run a brush quickly on the sides of the bowl (maybe). As a result, after 7 days the \"throat\" of the toilet was disgusting. If I had a brush I would have cleaned it myself.\\n* We were given face cloths only two of the seven days we were there. When I asked the maid I was told that they were \"out\". One day when I asked she gave me three, but when I came back later that evening, she had taken one back.\\n* There was a $30 per night charge for the rollaway. The rollaway was set up with the mattress upside down. We realized that after my son complained about the bed being uncomfortable on the 5th night.\\n* There was no corkscrew or wine glasses, but there was wine in the minibar. Room service brought them up about 15 minutes after I called. However, the wine opener was very cheap &amp; we couldn't open the wine with it. I went down to the front desk &amp; they tried, but couldn't open it either. Someone took it to the bar to get it opened. \\n* There is a fridge in the room but it is dedicated to the minibar. We were told that even if you opened the door it would trigger a charge. Of course I had to keep reminding my son to stop opening it. If it had a lock on it, there wouldn't have been a problem. $6.00 for M&amp;M's... please!\\n* We had some delicious leftovers from a dinner that I wanted to save for my daughter, who lives in NYC. I called housekeeping and was told there is a $6.44 charge for that service. Huh?\\n* As with most expensive hotels, there is a daily charge for Internet. It is $20 for 24 hours. Why do the cheap hotels offer it free and the expensive hotels charge? This I will never understand. It is a relic of the days when we were using modems through phone lines. There is no justification for Internet charges.\\nWe will look for another hotel on our next trip to New York. We stayed for 5 days over Valentine's weekend. The staff was friendly and the rooms were adequate, except for one day when we got back to the hotel at 5:30PM and the room wasn't cleaned. We called then and again at 6:30PM when we went out to have the room cleaned. Needless to say at 12:30AM we returned to a dirty room, our bed unmade and towels on the floor.\\nThe toilet backed up 3 times, the third time after it was worked on for a half hour. When I complained that we were leaving and needed to use it, the front desk told us to take a water from the mini bar and they wouldn't charge us.\\nNo fridge in the room, old TV's, rugs didn't look too clean.\\nRestaurant downstairs, Norma's had a reservation for 5 for breakfast (other people were in our party). We wanted to add another person. We spent over an hour in total, talking to the host and the manager. They said they couldn't accomodate 6, then they changed their mind and said they could, and then on the day of the reservation, when our cousin was already driving from upstate to meet us, they said they couldn't accomodate us.\\nIn the bar, good atmosphere, tea is $9, beer is $12 and a glass of wine $18 but the almonds and mixed nuts (free) are very good.\\nNew York has many great hotels, most for less expensive, Save your money and don't go to Le Parker Meridian I love the location, the bar is great to grab a drink after meetings or to relax, it's close to the park, museums &amp; shopping but the service is what makes Le Parker Meridien my favorite hotel. I was interviewing for a new job and a little nervous and Anandi at the front desk wished me luck and then checked back the next day to see how it went. (Who even remembers your name anymore?) She was so charming and sincere, it really made me feel valued. The whole staff is helpful and very approachable, professional but relaxed. I would recommend staying here to anyone who wants a little TLC from an unpretentious staff. Came on a long weekend to catch up on some shows. The check-in was smooth, the room although not huge was plenty big. The shower had the best water pressure EVER. Our concierge Andy was very knowledgeable and helpful. If I had anything to pick on was the lack of a room coffeemaker (it would have been a nice touch on those freezing days). I read complaints about the staff being rude, did not have that experience at all. And the gym charge is not unexpected in NYC....great stay :) I've traveled around the world and have stayed at many 4-5 star hotels and Le Parker Meridien in New York is the best hotel I've stayed at. My husband and I arrived on Friday afternoon and Joshua at the front desk was so helpful and nice and offered us a late check out on Sunday (without us having to ask) and upgraded us to a room with a view of Central Park. We later found out the hotel offers late check out until 5pm - so generous! The room was so spacious and the biggest we've stayed in for New York which is usually very cramped and the hotel gives complimentary shot glasses to their guests and has Peter Thomas Roth toileteries. Loved that! The gym/club which we didn't get to use on this stay but look forward to using on future stays has yoga and dance classes, racquet ball courts, and includes a session with a trainer for the $10 fee. Norma's for breakfast in the hotel was great. Very expensive but worth the experience. Lastly, we had the best doorman the day we left who approached us to help with our bags and let us know that our car was waiting for us. Overall, great hotel, great staff and great location! Can't wait to stay here again on our next visit. Great place! Convient to sightseeing and nightlife. The best breakfast in the city at Norma's, and an absolutely great burger at the Burger Joint! In the early hours of my trip to NYC, it was looking to be a nightmare. I had reservations through expedia on the wrong day of my arrival without the possibility of cancelation. After contacting Expedia and the Management of Le Parker Meridien they were more than willing to work with me. Although I was unable to receive my original low pricing from Expedia, Le Parker Meridien gave me a complementary upgrade to a Park view room! The room alone was worth the foolish mistake on my part; brilliant view, cozy as home, and spacious enough to live there for months! But if somehow you don't like the view from your room, go up the elevator to the roof deck/indoor pool where you can see the entire city. Rockefeller and the Empire State building will charge you an arm and a leg for something your hotel offers for free! Lastly, location! location! location! Smack dab in the heart of the city. Close to shopping, subways, and everything else you need/don't need. I think you get my point that I highly recommend this hotel and I am personally looking forward to my next stay, hope to see you there. I stayed at this hotel in early January using my Starwood points. Starwood made a reservation on my behalf and I stayed at the hotel for three consecutive nights. When I returned home I found that the Parker Meridien had double-billed me. I called to resolve the problem and initially I was reassured that the wrongful charge would be taken off my credit card account. \\nI have repeatedly checked my account since then to find that no such credit had occurred. Despite numerous attempts to contact the Accounting department of the hotel, my calls and requests have not been honored in a prompt fashion. Clearly this hotel does not honor frequent travelers nor does it abide by codes of professional conduct. I would only recommend staying at this hotel if someone else is paying for it, lest one find an unpleasant surprise in the form a double charge.\\nI have stayed at the Meridien in the past but this incident has led me to take my business elsewhere.\\nIncidentally, the room that the hotel initially assigned me was in an utter state of disarray. Top marks for great location v near to central park, Times Square, well placed for Lincoln Centre. Great view of central park from the window by the lift ( and presumably from rooms if you pay more for it)\\nIt's aiming at being achingly trendy but doesnt quite feel like it gets it right.\\nThe entrances on 57th and 56th are both inconspicuous and very hard to spot - cabbies often dont know how to find it. You have to walk through the bar to enter from 57th, which must detract from the vibe in the bar. Check in and out were efficient and swift.\\nI read that Normas is hip and great and fancied trying it, but didnt as it looked dead while we were there, with no clear signing, no natural light, only a few businessmen ever seemed to be in there. The burger place must be well hidden as we never spotted it! theres no guide to the hotel in the room so you wont know what facilities it has!\\nPool is disappointing, with tiny changing room with only one shower, so must be hell if it gets busy, but a pool is quite rare in NY . Beware as the pool is free but is NOT in the gym with the other facilities, which will charge you to enter even as a hotel guest. \\nI DOCK A STAR for any hotel mean enough to prevent you using the fridge in your room for your own drinks - this one has a warning sign on the door saying 'this is NOT a fridge, it is a minibar', warning that it has motion sensors which will charge you if you move anything - it says you can ask for a fridge for an extra charge! NO NO NO! I hate this in hotels. The minibar prices are a sick joke. Let paying guests use the in room facilities as they see fit!! Its not as if they arent paying lots of money. There is an ice machine down the corridor, a big noisy old fashioned one, not at all in keeping with the intended hip image. Must be horrid to have a room near it as its v v noisy. \\nClassic old cartoons in the lift is a cute touch.\\nThe room is v pleasant, quite cool and minimal in style, with a big TV which alas has only the basic poor US channel options, no decent US cable channels at all. You dont get a bathrobe unless you call housekeeping to specially ask for one, which I've never come across in this price bracket.. Good powerful shower\\nThe aircon/heater is quite noisy as it goes on and off through the night to maintain your chosen temp.\\nIf the location suits and you can get a decent off season deal then this is a good bet, but they would be better dropping the false attempts to be hip and concentrate on sensible things like an entrance you can spot , a fridge the paying room guests can use, better tv channel selection, internet without extortionate charges etc.\\nNever ate anything here so can't comment - breakfast is readily found in local deli/cafes. Excelente servicio, camas super king size que no te da ganas levantarte comodisímas. El desayuno tiene fama de ser uno de los mejores de la ciudad muy completo y variado, como en todos los hoteles de ee.uu siempre se paga aparte si no sueles comer demasiado no conviene por el precio que rondara los 28usd. es muy completo con show cooking!. Tiene el hotel además una zona muy informal ,de hamburguesas con una decoración muy original, son caseras muy buenas y de hecho viene gente de fuera a comer y cenar,lo recomiendo!!!tiene 2 entradas por la puerta de atrás esta el rockefeller center y el local tan famoso hooters. Un hotel bien situado y cómodo, está muy cerca de Times Square y de Central Park sin el bullicio de una avenida, habitaciones grandes, aunque un poco caro para mi opinión, lo mejor es la hamburguesería que hay en recepción, recomendaría este hotel si se coge a buen precio. superbe hotel, un emplacement idéal chambre spacieuse donnant sur central park de plus petit restaurant ou ils font les meilleurs hamburger de NY ! je l'ai testé et j'avoue qu'il sont très bon ! \\npiscine interieur, personnel de l'hotel super nous n'avons pris qu'une fois le petit dejeuné et en chambre : cottage cheese fruit vienoiserie vous pouvez choisir differente formule ! Hotel in posizione centralissima, a pochi minuti a piedi da Central Park, 5a Strada, e soprattutto vicinissimo a tutti i negozi \"in\" per lo shopping!!!!!!!! All'ultimo piano si gode una vista spettacolare su buona parte della città. Le camere sono molto spaziose e moderne molto graziose e pulite. Il personale molto gentile. Essendo in una grande città non abbiamo optato per la colazione in quanto uscendo dalla parte chiamiamola \"posteriore\" dell'hotel e quindi sulla 57th Street di fronte c'è un negozietto dove fanno delle colazioni molto abbondanti e con tutto quello che vuoi, e il costo è ridotto. Cet hôtel a été choisi pour son emplacement, le rapport prix de sa catégorie et le fait qu'il y avait une piscine.\\nNous n'avons pas été déçu de notre choix;\\nChambre réservée vue Central Park: attribution 26ème étage et la vue est là.\\nDeuxième séjour, attribution 41ème étage, rien à redire. Nous avions fait cette demande au check-out et le réceptionniste avec un large sourire nous a répondu que nous pouvions compter sur lui et ce fut le cas.\\nL'hôtel est ce que l'on appelle un gros porteur et pourtant on ne se sent pas perdu. Le personnel de la réception est chaleureux et à l'écoute. jamais l'impression de déranger.\\nPiscine très bien, personnel aussi agréable. Effectivement, c'est payant 10 dollars si vous êtes seul, 15 dollars pour ce qu'il appellent une occupation de \"multiples\".\\nChambre propre, mais sans charme.Le spectacle étant à votre fenêtre. Tre notti e la quarta improponibile ci hanno chiesto 550 dollari per una doppia senza colazione! comunque se' trovate delle offerte tramite dei tour andateci non e' per niente male! le stanze sono grandi, pulite, con tutto quello che serve tranne internet quella si paga ed e' anche cara.\\nLa posizione e' centralissima non male, con i 40 piani si gode anche di una bella vista oppure come dalla nostra stanza di un bellissimo grattacielo in ristrutturazione.\\nBuona anche la colazione e non male la spa! e la piscina all' ultimo piano. Hotel in posizione strategica a pochi minuti a piedi da Times Square e con vista mozzafiato dal 42° piano su Central Park. Ingresso e struttura abbastanza moderni, camere un pò meno, ma comunque molto grandi, pulite ed accoglienti. Il personale è stato molto gentile ed ospitale. Unica piccola pecca: colazione abbondante ma solo di tipo americano se servita all'ultimo piano con vista su Central Park. Presenza di piscina, wi-fi gratuito nella hall, starbuck's di fronte all'albergo per avere un caffè un pò più europeo e sfruttare la loro connessione wi fi gratuita. 地下鉄の駅からもすぐ、五番街や有名レストランも多くある便利な立地ですが、\\nここのポイントは、スタッフ皆さんが親切でNYらしからぬホスピタリティーを受けられました。\\nお部屋は28平米とそんなに広くはありませんが、モダンで清潔感があり気持ちよく滞在できました。\\nまた一番のポイントは窓からセントラルパークが望めることで、仕事をしたコンフォートデスクの正面に\\n窓があるので、気持ちよく仕事もできました。\\n※ホテル内、バーガーショップもおいしかったのでお勧めです。 bella scelta ,posizione invidiabile ,personale molto gentile ,trovato una receptionist italiana (viviana ) che mi ha dato ottimi consigli ,da provare gli hamburger del bar al piano terra \\nsuggerisco piano alto per vista Nous sommes revenus à New York et avons séjourné une troisième fois dans cet hotel. Quand vous n'avez pas vu sur Central Park la vue n'est pas très agréable: vue sur un immeuble en construction et un énorme climatiseur qui fait beacoup de bruit. Pour les enfants vous aurez surement le droit à un lit de camps, le mobilier est minime et la décoration inexcistante.\\nMAIS il faut le reconnaitre une très très bonne situation géographique, à quelques minutes de Central Park, de la 5ième Avenue et Times Square et du métro ce qui est fort agréable. Un personnel très gentil. \\nUn conseil: prennez le métro, qui vous plongera dans la vie New yorkaise, propre et immense il change de celui de Paris et vous promet de bons moments et de franches rigolades. Cela vous reviendra moins chèr qu'un taxi.\\nAu final un hotel qui vaut le coup pour sa situation géographique mais qui pour lui meme n'et pas le meilleur. Ottima posizione, personale gentile e disponibile, bella la struttura.\\nSiamo stati qua per i primi 5 giorni del nostro viaggio di nozze e ci siamo trovati davvero bene. La nostra camera era pulita, ampia e silenziosa. \\nConsigliato. Notevoli miglioramenti rispetto ad alcuni anni fa quando avevamo soggiornato nello stesso hotel; l'idea in effetti non ci entusiamava, ma una buona soluzione tariffaria, in un hotel comunque non economico ci ha riportato recentemente. Abbiamo trovato le camere più spaziose, adatte anche ad ospitare il rolloway bed comodamente....cosa non facile a New York. Non male l'arredamento di tipo moderno, ma si apprezza l'insonorizzazione sull'esterno e anche quella abbastanza buona sull'interno. Molto bello l'LCD per quel che lo si può usare, manca però il bollitore! Il bagno manca un po' di praticità...la vasca poteva essere sostituita da una doccia con un notevole risparmio di spazio da destinare magari allo sconosciuto bidè! Prenotato senza utilizzare agenzia, ma direttamente dal sito.\\nPer informazioni varie ho telefonato al numero verde e sono stati gentili, anche nell'accontentarmi sulla camera: una corner al 43esimo piano.\\nCamera molto buona, unico appunto alla finestra del bagno, non in buone condizioni.\\nInsonorizzazione sufficiente: certo, nonostante il 43esimo piano, si sentivano tutti i rumori del traffico (ambulanze, allarmi, spazzini etc etc). Personalmente non mi infastidiscono. Nessun rumore proveniente da altre stanze.\\nBuona scelta di giornali alla porta il mattino.\\nAscensori abbastanza veloci, se doveste annoiarvi vi potete sempre guardare i cartoni animati che vengono proiettati 24/7 negli lcd degli ascensori!\\nNel complesso è stato positivo: ma se cercate una sistemazione per dormire senza pretese, troverete altro a prezzo più basso. J'ai aimé mon séjour au Parker. Situé à 2 rues de Central Park et près de Colombus Circle, la 5ieme avenue à deux pas. Bonne ambiance au bar mais les Cosmopolitain à 18$ c'est mon seul bémol. On avait une chambre avec 2 lits trois quarts au lieu de queen comme prévu sur leur site de réservation ALL STAFFS ARE VERY KIND AND FULL OF HOSPITARITY.\\nTHANK YOU FOR ALL..\\n従業員の方たちが実に親切でした。レセプションのスタッフ、コンシェルジュ、レストランの受付、ポーター、部屋のメンテナンスの方たちを含め実に気持ち良い対応をしてもらいました。\\n部屋はジュニアスイートでしたが、合計4人で利用しましたが、2名は子供とはいえ、少し狭いのが唯一の難点。とにかく使いやすいホテルでした。 soggiornato in questo hotel ultima settimana di luglio con famiglia 2 adulti 2 bambini 8 e 11 anni\\nPregi:ottima posizione,centralissima e vicino a tutto, hamburgeria presente nell'hotel ottima anche se non bellissimo l'ambiente,personale gentilissimo e premuroso.Ottima piscina sui tetti ovviamente al chiuso ma molto interessante nei momenti di relax( non gratis costa 15 $ a camera),wi fi free solo nella hall. dIfetti: stanza piccola pur avendo prenotato una junior suite e bagno molto piccolo.Colazione in hotel molto cara come tutti gli alberghi di NY e non particolarmente ricca\\nPur essendo al 5 piano davanti ad entrata principale albergo ottima insonorizzazione,sul lato opposto stanno costruendo un albergo e sembra ci sia piu rumore. Difficile de ne pas être conquis par cet hôtel cosy, a l'épicentre de toutes les visites a réaliser a Manhattan...\\nQuelques points péjoratifs a signaler : petit déj gargantuesque mais hors de prix, pas de connexion internet gratuite, piscine du toit Payante++ (15$ par jour) sauf avec certaines réservations d'agence de voyage...rien de rédhibitoire :)\\nAprès, vous pouvez vous jeter dans la jungle urbaine et body-buildingée avec une bonne paire de baskets...et revenir régulièrement si vous le désirez effectuer une halte dans la chambre, déposer les achats par exemple...NY n'est clairement par contre, pas du tout une ville bon marché et vous allez devoir prendre l'habitude de TOUT payer régulièrement! Le rêve américain ! Globalement c'est un bon hôtel, même si nous n'avons pas testé la restauration. Les chambres sont agréables et bien équipées, le personnel est très aimable. L'immeuble en construction juste à côté de l’hôtel n'est pas très gênant, même si les travaux commencent à 7h du matin.\\nLe seul petit point noir est que lorsque vous réservez pour 3 personnes dans la même chambre vous vous attendez à ce qu'il y est des vrais lits, comme c'est généralement le cas aux USA et non pas un lit d'appoint. Meridien , un bon hotel a recommander . Parfois un besoin de renovation dans les chambres , mais dans l ensemble c 'est tres bien . remarquablement place pres de Central Park , Tout est a proximite.\\nExcellent petit dejeuner , mais un peu cher . \\nTout se paye en plus ...\\nAttention , le Minibar n 'est pas un refrigerateur , cela surrprend , sauf les amateurs de biere tiede. Hotel tres correcte , frequente par une majoritecd europeensc et francais \\nDemander chambreven etages eleves pour voir central,park\\nLe gros plus c est aussi le celebre burgerjoin un restaurant de hamburgers super planqueva lavreception a droite derriere unrideau rouge\\nPscievsur le toit sympa restaurant et arvimpersonnel 場所もかなり便利なところにあり、ＮＹのホテルにしてはかなり広さがありました。\\nお風呂もバスタブが広く、お湯を張ることもできました。\\n1階のハンバーガーショップのハンバーガーも美味しかったです。\\nごはんの時間帯には行列ができていました。\\nひとつ難点は帰りのタクシーがつかまえづらかったことです。\\n少し価格が高いですが、また宿泊したいホテルです。 le Parker Meridien est un tres bon hotel 4* ou nous descendons souvent, tres bien situé (pres de central park, quelques blocs de times square), excellent accueil, les vues des chambres sont souvent tres jolies vue sur central park, et la piscine au dernier etage est une pure merveille,nager dans les nuages entre les building est une pure merveille à faire au moins une fois. Das Le Parker Meridien ist ein schönes Hotel in Manhatten mit Blick auf den Central Park. Um diesen vom Zimmer aus zu geniesen, sollte man versuchen ein Zimmer in den oberen Etagen zu bekommen, und dann natürlich mit Blick auf den Park. Als SPG Platinum wollte man mir zunächst ein normales Zimmer geben, als ich dann aber um eine hohe Etage gebeten hatte, wurde mir dieser Wunsch erfüllt und auch gleich in eine Juniorsuite umgewandelt. Die Bar in der Eingangshalle ist recht nett, aber nichts besonderes. Das Hotel kann man von zwei Seiten aus betreten. Premetto che questa è la terza volta che soggiorniamo in questo hotel dal giugno 2011 e sinceramente credo che abbiano cambiato manager o altro perchè a nostro avviso è peggiorato.\\nAbbiamo chiesto in fase di prenotazione a marzo 2012 (viaggio 20/29 giugno 2012) 2 camere vista parco vicine ma all'arrivo una era al 29 piano e l'altra al 39 chissà perchè ,accappatoio in camere va richiesto ogni giorno altrimenti non lo mettono, la piscina pergli ospiti dell'albergo a pagamento (25 dollari) le camere poi niente di che, bagno minuscolo insomma cambiare va bene ma in meglio non in peggio Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per 4 giorni. La stanza è molto ampia e luminosa. Dotata di servizi comodi e frigo bar. Alla parete c'è un per 42 pollici ultra piatto.\\nTutto ultra pulito. Personale molto professionale e disponibile a soddisfare qualunque richiesta.\\nSicuramente un punto a favore di questa struttura è la posizione centralissima che permette di girare Manhattan tranquillamente a piedi.\\nLa colazione è abbondante e ricca, ma non a buffet.\\nSicuramente da consigliare al 100% Ho soggiornato quattro notti al Parker Meridien nell'agosto 2010. La stanza era pulita e spaziosa. Bella la piscina al 42esimo piano, con vista splendida. Personale molto cortese: una sera, verso le 23, avevamo bisogno di una coperta in più ed hanno prontamente soddisfatto la nostra richiesta. La posizione, poi, è ottima. Al mattino presto mi piaceva uscire da sola a fare una passeggiata sulla quinta strada che a piedi è proprio vicinissima. Non mi dispiacerebbe tornarci. Hôtel assez bien situé (à 10-15 minutes à pied de Time square, à 5 minutes de Central Park).\\nPropre.\\nCher par rapport à ce qui est proposé. Mais enfin, les prix à New York sont chers... Après le petit déj est en (très gros supplément), la piscine en supplément...\\nLe design n'est pas bluffant, un peu vieillot peut-être. 乗り継ぎ便の関係でニューヨークに一泊することになり、ついでにブロードウェーでミュージカルを堪能することにして、徒歩圏内のホテルということでいくつかの中からた選びました。ここはスターウッド系列らしく（シェラトンやウェスティンなどのホテルグループ）、セントラルパークが見えるツインベッドの部屋を希望していたので、日本国内で電話予約が可能で、細かいリクエストやある程度のクレームにも対応してもらえそうだったので決めました。お値段はそれなりでしたが、マンハッタンは世界一ホテル代がかさむらしいですし、最終日の疲れや夜行動することを考えれば、リーズナブルではないかと感じました。お部屋はシンプルなつくりでやや古さが感じられましたが、清潔感は保たれていたので特に不満は感じませんでした。部屋からのセントラルパークの眺めを楽しみつつ名物（？）のハンバーガーをほおばっていました。 Hotel bien situé avec une belle vue sur central park. \\nEn revanche, pas à la hauteur d'un 4 étoiles. \\nLa chambre est petite, la literie mauvaise, la salle de bain minuscule et en mauvais état (inutile d'espérer trouver des peignoirs et chaussons, même si vous avez payé le prix fort), le personnel à peine aimable. \\nLa piscine est payante (même si vous comptez faire un plongeon relaxant). \\nLe petit déjeuner est à la carte, très cher mais délicieux. Les serveurs s'impatientent si vous ne parlez pas bien anglais... \\nAttention, j'ai demandé la monnaie sur 20 dollars et on m'a rendu sur 10 à la réception de l'hotel... C'est grave pour un 4 étoiles... Niet het meest goedkope hotel in New York, maar wel één van de mooiste. Onze kamer had een uitzicht op Central Park, de mensen waren ontzettend behulpzaam, de kamer waren netjes en schoon en de bar beneden heel gezellig. De ligging is ook geweldig en ook al zit je midden in de drukte, je merkt er niets van. Zeker een aanrader. Hôtel très bien situé, à 5 minutes au sud de Central Park, à 10 minutes de Times Square, à 5 minutes de la 5ième avenue. Junior Suite pour une famille de 4 dont 2 ados très agréable au 22ième étage (très calme). Vous pouvez demander d'être le plus haut possible. Personnel serviable et certains sont francophones. Une piscine au 43 ième étage ouverte de 6h à 22h45 en semaine, 8h-20h45 le week-end(15 dollars par jour par famille). Au rez de chaussée, un petit resto de Hamburgers excellents mais souvent il y a la queue. Un lobby pour utiliser Internet gratuitement. Sinon payant dans les chambres (15 dollars par 24 h). Je recommande de prendre le petit-déjeuner autour de l'hôtel, les cafés ne manquent pas (Starbuck et autres) et c'est plus raisonnable. Proximité de toutes les lignes de métro. Nous sommes enchantés de l'hôtel et de New York: voyage sensationnel! Ce bel hôtel est propre et bien situé tout proche de central park et de la 5 th avenue et de time square.Idéal pour bien découvrir Manhattan et faire du shopping. Le plus , une piscine, située au dernier étage, propre avec vue sur central park mais payante ( 15 $ par chambre ),non mentionné sur les différents sites. Le personnel est très hospitalier et serviable.Pour le petit-déjeuner, il y a plusieurs possibilités juste à coté de l'hôtel (starbuck café, petit restaurant ouvert dés le matin , épicerie).\\nLes chambres sont propres,la décoration est soignée, la salle de bain est de taille correcte (serviettes et produits de bains renouvelés tous les jours ). L'insonorisation des chambres est tout à fait correcte . En bref,nous sommes satisfait de notre séjour dans cet hôtel et New York est une destination à faire même avec des enfants (5 ans) !!! Hotel che conferma la qualità della catena Starwood. Posizione centrale tra Central Park e Time Square. Vi consiglio la camera con vista su Central Park. Ottimo servizio e pulizia. Un pò troppo lenti gli ascensori che portavano al nostro piano. Piscina a pagamento con vista sulla città. Non abbiamo mai fatto colazione o mangiato in hotel per vivere meglio Manhattan. \\nLo consiglio sia a coppie che a famiglie. Wir hatten einen freundlichen Empfang, relativ kurze Wartezeit für New Yorker Hotels. In der Lobby wie häufig viel Betrieb. Als SPG Platinum Members gab es ein upgrade zu einer Junior Suite, modern ganz in Ordnung aber wie oft in New York nicht wirklich sauber. Das Badezimmer überraschend gross!! Die Lage des Hotels natürlich gut...das Frügstück ( hochgelobt ) völlig normal, überteuert und in einem \"sterilen Restaurant\"...eigentlich nicht zu empfehlen. Das Le Parker schon...je nachdem welchen Zimmer-Tarif man erwischt Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut, wie bei vielen Hotels zwischen Times Square und Central Park. Das Le Parker liegt nahe dem Central Park , nahe der 5th Avenue sodass vieles zu Fuss erreicht werden kann. Wie in den meisten New Yorker Hotels ist die Lobby Atmosphäre wie auf dem Hauptbahnhof. Der Empfang war nett, als SPG Platinum erhielten wir ein upgrade zu einer Executive Suite, modern , zweckmässig. Das Badezimmer gross für NY Verhältnisse und modern eibgerichtet. Die Sauberkeit liess zu wünschen übrig, übrigens kennen wir das aus NY nichts anders in diesen Hotel Kategorien ( Sheraton/ Westin / Le Meridien ) . Das Frühstück im Hotel war überraschend gut, wie immer etwas fett wie üblich aber in Ordnung. Der Frühstücksraum steril , ungemütlich. Für einen Zimmerpreis von 299 $ mit Frühstück waren wir ganz zufrieden und das zur Osterzeit . Die Preise in New Yorker Hotels variieren ja extrem. \\nInsgesamt waren wir ganz zufrieden und können das Hotel empfehlen!! メリディアンといえば一応高級の部類に入るブランドで、実際結構とりますが、結構年季が入っているのを、一応一所懸命改装やメンテしてるって感じ。ホント、相変わらずニューヨークのホテルは高いですね。ミッドタウンど真ん中の便利な場所だし仕方ないですが。\\nエレベーターとか古いです。ただ室内はモダンにまとめてるので、部屋に帰ってしまえば特に問題は無し。\\nここは朝食が名物で、結構口コミサイトの類でえらい上位ランクになってます。休日の朝とか、外から訪れる人も含め大混雑。パンケーキとかエッグベネディクトとか、アメリカ人が喜びそうなすごい盛り付けでやってきます。ま、旅の風情として結構楽しいです。仕事の前だとこんなに朝から食べたら苦しくて何もやる気なくなっちゃいますが（苦笑）\\n無難にちゃんとしたホテルだけど値段考えれば当たり前、星三つかなとも思いつつ、NY値段はしょうがないので四つということで。 Ce bel hôtel est conforme au standard Méridien, infrastructure et services. Il est au centre de \"tout\" ce qui est particulièrement appréciable. Les chambres et les SdB sont d'une taille très correcte pour NYC. La décoration est soignée. Le service est prévenant et une partie du personnel parle français. La conciergerie est particulièrement efficace. L'insonorisation est bonne et il n'y a plus de travaux dans la rue comme j'ai pu le lire avant mon départ dans les autres avis. La piscine au 42ème offre une vue superbe, dommage qu'il faille débourser 15$ pour y accéder suite à des aménagements. Elle n'est donc plus gratuite comme cela est indiqué sur de nombreux sites. Le petit déjeuner est délicieux mais le prix prohibitif (à faire une fois) environ 45$, sinon Starbuck et Dean Deluca juste en face. Il faut absolument gouter au meilleur burger de NYC situé dans l'hôtel au \"Burger Joint\", et comme c'est bon il y a souvent de l'attente. 1Fフロント横のハンバーガー目当てで、4月に夫婦で宿泊しました。パークビューの窓からの眺めは写真の通り素晴らしい。ハンバーガーを部屋食できるので、ここに宿泊で正解だなと思いました。冷めたら残念ですし、店内は…個人的に落ち着いて味わいたい人向けでない雰囲気です。客室はスリッパ無し、寝間着無し、歯ブラシ無し、勿論シャワートイレ無し、更にコインランドリー無しとアメリカハイソ向けスタンダードといった感じですが、全体的にお洒落な印象でした。宿泊時のアメニティは、PeterThomasRothのShampoo／Conditioner／Body Lotion／石けんで、香りも良し（個人差）。スーツケースが重めな方は、空港との移動にシャトルバンのネット手配をお勧めします。 Paramos en este hotel en un viaje al US Open. El hotel es muy lindo, pero no se puede soportar el ruido y la vibracion de la construccion de al lado. nos ofrecieron hacer un upgrade por una habitacion que no sea ruidosa, por la cual nos hicieron pagar 200 U/S dolares extra por noche. El desayuno es carisimo y nunca hay lugar. El olor a hamburguesa en el lobby de entrada es desagradable Geniale Lage neben Carnegiehall, um die Ecke zum Central Park, Broadway, MoMa.... Frühstück im Hotel meiden! Tolle Cafes überall ringsum zum Frühstücken. Unbedingt die Burger im Hotel probieren! Klasse Service,freundlich und hilfsbereit. Zimmer sehr sauber, nicht hellhörig! Ausblick vom Pool genießen, der ist kostenlos! Schwimmen kostet!\\nAlles in Allem: Grandios, sehr zu empfehlen! Non avevo mai soggiornato a midtown e già questa è stata una piacevole scoperta. L'hotel è vicinissimo a parecchi luoghi interessanti e a molti punti nevralgici di New York: Central Park, Columbus Circle, Times square, MoMA, Rockefeller center. Tutto sommato, siamo riusciti ad arrivare a piedi anche all'Empire state building e al Metropolitan museum. L'albergo è molto confortevole, il personale cortese, il servizio celere e preciso. Bello il bar vicino all'entrata sulla 57ª, mentre la lobby è sulla 56ª. Non ci sono ristoranti in senso tradizionale, ma ottimi hamburger da Burger Joint e ottime colazioni da Norma's. Suggerisco le camere su Central Park: dal 25º piano in su la vista è fantastica. La camera standard è ampia, così come il bagno. Arredamento semplice e moderno, con ottimi spazi. Pratica la scrivania, comodi i letti. Mia moglie e io non avevamo molta roba, ma per chi si porta tanti vestiti non sarebbe sgradito qualche cassetto in più e un armadio più grande. Oltre a un paio di appendiabiti vicino alla porta (ma perché molti alberghi non li mettono? Lo spazio non manca). Prezzi in linea con quelli di midtown e con la categoria, per una settimana la stanza ci è costata quasi 2000 euro, comprese tasse, imposta di soggiorno e tutto quanto. Dieses Hotel gehört zweifellos an die Spitze. Der Filme in den Aufzug zu den schönen Zimmern mit modernen Farben und einem Swimmingpool und Blick auf das Dach. Beachten Sie, dass der Fitnessraum im Hotel zusätzliche Kosten entstehen (wie alles andere in dieser Stadt) und wird von Einheimischen frequentiert.\\n Auch die Restaurants in der Lobby sehr beschäftigt und es könnte schneller sein, um Ihr Glück anderswo zu bekommen.\\n Die Zimmer sind überraschend ruhig und groß ist, ist es nicht optimal für diesen Standort in der Nähe des Central Park ist extrem selten. Hôtel très bien situé, idéale pour découvrir Manhattan: 10 min à pieds de Times square, 5 min de Central Park , de la 5th Avenue et de Rockfeller Center. Les chambres sont confortables , il faut demander une chambre dans les étages supérieurs au 20ème étage pour bénéficier de la vue sur Central Park. Cependant, l'équipement comme la Télé ne sont pas Hi tech et les fenêtres mal isolées.Le personnel est très hospitalier et serviable, à la réception quelques employées parlent français.La piscine située au dernier étage dégage une vue imprenable sur la ville surtout la nuit c'est magnifique. Le petit resto est réputé pour les meilleurs hamburgers de NY mais franchement c'est pas le cas, de plus il y a une file d'attente interminable, si vous voulez manger allez y quelques min avant l'ouverture.Pour le petit déjeuner , vous trouverez un StarBucks juste en face sinon il y a pleins de petits resto à proximité qui en propose.Une astuce les croissants de la superette Duane Reade sont très bons et pas chers et en plus ils sont énormes.\\nEn bref nous sommes satisfait de notre séjour dans cet hôtel surtout pour la proximité des lieux principaux de NY. 毎回ジュニアスイートに宿泊致しました。\\n寝室と居間があるのでそれなりに広さを感じます。\\n多分部屋の広さは50～60㎡弱ではないでしょうか。\\nソファーも通常のソファーと窓越しに固定設定されたソファーがあり\\nソファーが多く、ゆったりできます。 Per cinque notti ho soggiornato con mio figlio in questo hotel consigliatomi da amici e, pur essendovi di meglio in città quanto a lusso, a immagine e a soluzioni più \"trendy\", riconosco di aver trovato cortesia, efficienza, pulizia, buone dotazioni extra, come ad esempio la gradevole piscina panoramica non frequente in alberghi anche molto più acclamati. L'accoglienza è stata cortese ma impersonale,la stanza piccola ma efficiente, come pure il minuscolo bagno. i letti comodi. La posizione agli ultimi piani consentiva di avere una bellissima vista su Central Park nonostante l'hotel non fosse posizionato in prima linea su Central Park South dove si trovano grandi hotel prestigiosi. Particolarmente soddisfacente il breakfast che non era a buffet ma servito alla carta con buona scelta di cibi caldi e freddi, dolci e salati preparati con cura e ben serviti. Si diceva tra l'altro che l'hotel è famoso e premiato proprio per la migliore colazione della città e la sala breakfast era infatti sempre piuttosto affollata ad ogni ora. La posizione infine è conveniente per il centro, la metropolitana e per la particolarità che l'hotel , occupando un intero block, ha due accessi: dalla 56esima e dalla parallela 57esima il che rende più comodo ritrovarlo arrivando da una parte e dall'altra,\\nLe informazioni dei due concierge, consultati una sola volta, sono state rapide ma cortesi. Il portiere, infine, fischiando con molta determinazione, ha poi trovato in pochi secondi un taxi per condurci alla stazione ferroviaria. Zimmer 2128\\nverhältnismässig ruhig, da 21.

La Blanqueria del cuarto\\n muy linda y siempre limpia... La vista que nos toco no fue muy linda...\\nNo tuvimos la oportunidad pero sabiamos que en la terraza habia una pileta climatizada con una vista increible al Central Park.\\nEn el lobby hay una casa de hamburguesas que dicen que son riquisimas, siempre habia cola en el lobby para comprarlas. Abbiamo pernottato dal 16 al 20 febbraio riscontrando nella stanza un arredamento funzionale, servizio camera ottimo, disponibilità del personale della hall.\\nLa posizione dell'albergo è ottima, essendo vicina a Time Square, al Central Park e volendo è possibile raggiungere facilmente gli ingressi alla metropolitana.\\nL'idea di creare un luogo di ristorazione per giovani all'interno dell'albergo, come alternativa più economica al ristorante, è lodevole, non tantp lo spazio attribuitogli. Estuvimos en nuestra luna de miel, es un hotel bonito y bueno... excelente localización.\\nAunque me decepcionó la vista que teníamos desde la habitación, supongo que hubiese sido fácil de solucionar si hubiésemos pedido una habitación con vistas.\\nNos dejaron fresas con chocolate y una botella de champange.\\nEs cierto que los armarios tienen una cortina como puerta, pero no queda tan mal.\\nEl baño es pequeño, pero decente.\\nLa habitación era amplia y la cama muy cómoda. superbe chambre , avec vue sur central park a 3 minutes pied , faut essayer les amberger de la place , tres typique et pitoreste mais tellement bon \\nje la recommande sans hesiter A un paso de 5th Ave. y de Central Park. Hotel moderno, bien cuidado y con precios (para su nivel en Manhattan) no excesivamente desmesurados. Cuenta entre sus instalaciones con una piscina cubierta bastante aparente. La decoración es funcional y las habitaciones muy cómodas. Preferible las plantas más altas. hotel gradevole : accoglienza ottima , gestione informazioni ottima gentile \\ncamera essenziale ricambio biancheria giornaliera \\nposizione ottima sia per i trasferimenti ( aeroporti ) sia per i percorsi turistici ( 5° strada a due isolati ) subway a pochi passi , central park a disposizione \\nbuono il ristorante anche se un po' caro rispetto alla media Hôtel très bien situé, proche de Central Park, de la 5th Avenue, de Broadway et du Rockfeller Center. Idéal pour partir à la découverte de Manhattan en famille.\\nLes chambres pour 4 personnes sont bien équipés et très agréable. Le service est agréable et de bonne qualité. Le personnel de la réception est disponible et compétent.\\nUne très belle piscine sur le toit (agréable le soir après une bonne journée de marche et idéal avec des enfants).\\nCôté restauration, le bar à Hamburger à très bien (très simple mais très bon, à faire une fois). Pour le petit déjeuner, ne pas hésiter à sortir pour le prendre à l'extérieur à l'exception du brunch car le NORMA'S est réputé pour son brunch du dimanche (réservation obligatoire même si on réside à l'hôtel). Beaucoup de restaurants à proximité de l'hôtel voir dans Central Park (le midi).\\nNous y reviendrons c'est certain. El hotel muy bien ubicado, entre la 6 y la 7 avenida. Moderno, con una hamburguesería excelente y un lobby bar muy bueno. Lo único malo es que están de obras en el edificio de al lado, lo estas construyendo. Así que echadle un par de años, por lo menos de trabajo. Íbamos en grupo y nos dieron la quinta planta. Imaginar el ruido de la perforadora antes de las siete de la mañana!! Pedimos cambio y nos dijeron que juntas no iban a tener y que eran peores habitaciones, y nos querian cobrar 100 dolares por noche por ser habitaciones en plantas altas!!!!! les dijimos que nos era indiferente pero queríamos cambio, y que no íbamos a pagar por poder dormir, ya que donde estábamos era imposible, las obras van de 7h a 16h, nos dieron separados pero en la planta 15 y 22. Si sabes lo del ruido, no pongas a los clientes en la 5planta, o igual es por si cuela y no se quejan, pero vaya!, Pero supongo que será como en todos los hoteles depende del de recepción que te toque, porque luego conocimos a un recepcionista llamado Rafael, hispano que nos trato de maravilla. Así que si vais, directamente preguntar por el, porque los chicos de recepción, :(. En fin quitando ese percance por lo demás bien, limpio, agradable, la piscina muy bien. Y la zona también. Recomendable Ho soggiornato in questo hotel a marzo 2011 con mio marito che era a NY per un viaggio di lavoro, mentre io ne ho approfittato per visitare la citta'.\\nMi ritengo soddisfatta di questo hotel: la camera era spaziosa e il letto comodo. Il bagno, invece, era un po' deludente.\\nIl plus di questa sistemazione, in ogni caso, e' dato dalla location, davvero comoda a due passi dalla 5th Av, Central Park e Times Square.\\nHo, inoltre, apprezzato il fast food all'interno dell'hotel, che si dice prepari uno dei migliori hamburger di NY e che in un paio di occasioni si e' rivelato un'ottima soluzione per la cena. Das beste vom Parker ist die Lage und der Gym (wobei fuer den diesen noch extra zahlen muss). Heraussragend ist das Frühstück im Normas. Ein besseres gibt es in New York nicht. Die Zimmer sind dafür enttäuschend und wenn man Pech hat, wartet man ewig, bis der richtige Aufzug kommt. Die Anzahl der Zimmer und die Höhe des Gebäudes hätte mehr Aufzüge nötig. Sauberkeit ist ok. Service sehr amerikanisch (freundlich aber oberflächig). Insgesamt -obwohl ich ein Fan von Meridien bin- leider nur befriedigend. Siamo appena ritornati da un soggiorno di 3 notti in questo albergo bello, pulito e accogliente.\\nLe camere sono grandi e spaziose, molto ben arredate, ed il personale è gentile e disponibile.\\nDopo aver letto le recensioni che parlavano di \"lavori in corso rumorosi \" ho chiesto una stanza non ai piani bassi. Mi è stata data una location al 14° piano assolutamente silenziosa.\\nI lavori iniziano alle 8 di mattina ma impossibile accorgersene perchè con il jet lag vi assicuro che sarete svegli e pronti per uscire già molte ore prima!\\nL'albergo è a due passi da Central Park, 5° Av., Time Square ecc , insomma posizione ideale per raggiungere in breve tempo i punti di piu' interesse tenuto anche conto che vicino c'è la fermata Metro.\\nSe dovessi tornare a NY sceglierei nuovamente questo albergo El hotel es muy bonito, con una decoración minimalista, mi habitación en un piso alto tenía unas vistas impresionantes. En la planta baja tiene una pequeña hamburgueseria muy recomendable, hay que buscarla porque está bastante escondida, suele estar a tope, para esos dias os recomiendo subirse la hamburguesa a la habitación. Siamo stati a NY a novembre 2011 e, visto che dovevamo festeggiare un evento un po' speciale volevamo soggiornare in un hotel di lusso. Dal catalogo dell'agenzia e dal prezzo che avevamo pagato ci aspettavamo un posto davvero bello e invece è stato una delusione. La hall completamente spoglia, per non dire squallida (sembrava di entrare in un magazzino), la camera ordinaria, il bagno con la porta che non si chiudeva bene, la porta del bagno con i bordi che si staccavano dall'umidità, il set di cortesia che consisteva solo nel sapone, l'armadio era costituito da una piccola nicchia chiusa da una tenda che sembrava un ripostiglio, dove c'era l'asse da stiro e la cassaforte. La presenza della cassaforte impediva di stendere bene gli abiti che così avevano sempre il bordo stropicciato. Quello che era buono di questo hotel era la posizione e la vista sulla città. eravamo al 41 piano e quindi avevamo un bel panorama, soprattutto di notte.\\nNelle stesse giornate erano a new york altri amici nostri che hanno soggiornato in un hotel a 200 metri dal nostro, a pari stelle e a metà del prezzo pagato da noi. Ci siamo pentiti della nostra scelta in quanto il loro albergo era di gran lunga migliore del nostro, sia la hall che le camere. la posizione di questo grande albergo è perfetta per chi desidera fare un giro sulla 5a! La struttura è pronta a ricevere i grandi gruppi degli operatori turistici. meno avvezzo al turista indipendente: non è prevista una figura che dia consigli utili per girare o prenotare ristoranti. il costo è quello di un albergo di lusso, ma è assente il servizio del grande albergo di lusso. Il ristorante (molto buono) chiude alle tre del pomeriggio, il servizio colazioni in camera non rispetta gli orari e nell'ultimo mese di novembre alle 7.30 del mattino ci si può svegliare con il frastuono del martello pneumatico. la struttura si scusa e garantisce la distribuzione camera per camera di tappi per le orecchie!! per il resto, il ristorantino dietro i tendoni al pian terreno che serve hamburger è delizioso (aperto anche la sera)! Das ist meine neue Lieblings-Hotel in New York, ist es in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Central Park, damit ich auch mehrere Morgen joggen bin.\\n Die Zimmer sind geräumig und modern, wirklich einfach schön.\\n Die Aufzüge sind sehr effizient und gut verteilt. Auf dem Dach befindet sich eine Terrasse mit Pool, ist die Aussicht schön, aber die Anlage kann noch modernisiert werden.\\n Wir haben auch Nutzung des Fitnessstudios und Wellness-Anlage auf USD 10 pro Tag gemacht. Das war nicht besonders in Bezug auf Wellness, sondern ein umfangreiches Fitness-Studio.\\n Das Hotel ist ziemlich beschäftigt auf der Lobby-Ebene des Restaurants Einrichtungen, auch so beschäftigt, dass wir gefrühstückt anderswo. Aber zum Glück gibt es reichlich Auswahl in New York. Los cuartos son muy agradables en estilo modernista. Ubicado a media cuadra del Carnegie Hall y a dos cuadras de Central Park sobre la 57th, prácticamente todo lo puede uno hacer caminando. Hay alberca y un gimnasio, el personal es muy amable e incluso le dan a uno sombrillas en caso de lluvia. \\nCon la enorme ventaja de que a media cuadra en la 57th hay un restaurante sensacional que se llama Mangia donde pasa uno a servirse en un plato y este lo pesan y le cobran a uno de acuerdo a ello.\\nLo que me pareció estupendo es que el check out sea hasta las 3 Von aussen ist das Hotel eine Straße hinter dem Central Park keine Offenbarung, allerdings ist es von innen wunderbar!\\nDie Aussicht auf den Central Park ist atemberaubend! Leider gab es am 13.-14.10. erheblichen Baulärm. Das Frühstück im Hotel kann man auslassen (Preis und Angebot)\\nDie Bar und die Eingangshalle sind sehenswert!\\nDas Zimmer ist geraeumig - das Bad ist modern eingerichtet Siamo stati in questo hotel per due notti nel mese di ottobre. Si trova in una posizione ottima per vedere New york, a pochi passi dalla metro, da entral Park e da Times square. Sono però assolutamente da evitare le came ai primi piani, perchè, purtroppo stanno facendo dei lavori e non si riesce a dormire. Iniziano dalle 7 del mattino e proseguono sino a sera. Inoltre le camere standard non sono un granchè, mentre le camere deluxe sono decisamente un'altra cosa. In un primo momento ci avevano messo in una camera standard, ma dato il frastuono insopportabile, abbiamo chiesto di essere trasferiti in una camera migliore, siamo finiti al 31 piano, in una deluxe, tutta un'altra cosa. Per la colazione, nessun problema, di fronte c'è uno Starbucks. Sicuramente non è economico! nous avions une chambre vue central park au 37ème étage. Chambre un peu petite mais la literie est d'excellente qualité. Salle de bain assez étroite mais largement dotée en serviettes, shampoing, gel douche...seul problème mais de taille : les travaux de marteaux piqueurs qui vous réveillent tous les jours à 7h00 pétante (9h00 la samedi et rien le dimanche). c'est hyper désagréable car le bruit est réellement assourdissant (impossible presque de se parler dans le hall de réception). Bien sûr aucune info en amont de la part de l'hotelier pas plus qu'un prix \"discounté\" pour compenser ce désagrément. Piscine trés agréable au 41ème étage avec des plages d'ouverture trés larges. Hotel trés bien placé pour point de départ des visites Manhattan. Prenez le petit déjeuner au star buck en façe Wir hatten dieses Hotel über Hotwire gebucht und wirklich ein Schnäppchen gemacht. Für 109 Euro pro Nacht bekamen wir ein tolles Zimmer mit Blick auf den Central Park. Die Zimmer sind recht groß, sehr hell und auch sehr gemütlich. Wir hatten ein paar Probleme mit der Aircon und auf Nachfrage bekamen wir dann einen Heizlüfter ins Zimmer gestellt. Das war schon supernett. Das Internet kostete (17 $ Tag), klappte aber überhaupt nicht. Wir hatten kein Frühstück, aber in NY ist das ja kein Problem, da es Kaffee an jeder Ecke gibt. Toll ist der Pool im obersten Stockwerk. Gerade bei Nacht hat meinen einen tollen Blick Richtung City und Richtung Central-Park. Beliebt scheint auch die winzige Burger-Bar zu sein - wir haben aber nur einen Blick reingeworfen. U-Bahn Eingänge und Bushaltestellen sind in der Nähe. Ich würde wieder dort übernachten. Voyage du 8 au 13 octobre 2011.\\nEffectivement ce n'est pas le moment de réserver une chambre vue sur Central Park ! La chambre (pour nous au 34ème étage) était très mal insonorisée. Le vent sifflé dans les fenêtres + les travaux dès le matin 7h avec des bruits de marteaux piqueurs ! Pas idéal pour les vacances !\\nSinon l'hôtel est très bien situé par rapport à Times square et Central Park.\\nPour info, par rapport au prix du petit déjeuner, il est possible de l'acheter à l'extérieur et de le ramener dans les chambres.\\nLa chambre était spacieuse mais la salle de bain trop étroite, pas de peignoir mais assez de serviettes pour 2 dans notre cas.\\nBon séjour à vous à New York, pour nous ça reste un très bon souvenir! Nous avons séjourné au Parker du 10 au 14 oct 2011. L'hôtel n'a plus rien des fastes des séjours que j'avais connus dans les années 80 et 90, quand il était français et luxueux. Il n'est plus français ni luxueux: les salles de bains paraissent incroyablement exigues face à la concurrence, il ne faut pas séjourner trop longtemps faute de savoir où installer ses vêtements puisque l'essentiel de la chambre est occupé par le meuble tournant de la TV, les peintures des portes mériteraient d'être rafraichies,etc..Sans parler des petits-déjeuners aux prix démentiels et surtout injustifiés!!!! Mais l'essentiel réside dans un chantier sur l'arrière de l'hôtel. Toutes les chambres donnant sur la 57th str. sont réveillées dès 7h par le bruit de deux excavateurs qui démolissent les fondations d'un ancien bâtiment. Ce qui va durer jusqu'à fin novembre et touche aussi des parties communes: impossible de s'entendre avec le personnel dans le lobby jusqu'à 17h-18h. Au-delà de novembre, le personnel du Meridien reste très discret mais celui du chantier laisse entendre que la reconstruction d'un nouveau bâtiment va prolonger les nuisances sans doute jusque fin 2012. Bref, il vaut mieux regarder les concurrents du voisinage, dans ce quartier qui a tout de même l'incomparable avantage d'être entre Times Square et Central Park. Sono appena tornata da NY che conosco bene. L'albergo è in un'ottima posizione, la camera non grande ma con una bella vista su Central Park, il servizio camere buono, mentre per la colazione consiglio vivamente di andare altrove ... si rischia di aspettare per un caffè anche 40 minuti! Ma la cosa veramente tremenda è stato il rumore... ci sono dei lavori in corso al piano terra e ogni mattina alle 7 precise comincia a lavorare il martello pneumatico ... eravamo al 27 piano ma non era possibile più stare nè in camera nè nell'albergo. Avrebbero dovuto almeno segnalarlo e praticare uno sconto adeguato per compensare il grande disagio provocato. Se proprio volete prenotare in questo albergo assicuratevi che i lavori siano finiti. Visitare New York non vuol dire certo alloggiare negli hotel principeschi ma credo che sia utile almeno che sia in posizione ottimale per gli spostamenti turistici che si debbono affrontare...bene per la posizione questo hotel è buono ma di certo non vale il costo della camera che si presenta ancora con la moquette e non ha alcuna bella vista sulla città...anzi!!\\nBagno piccolissimo ed ovviamento \"cieco\"! nota positiva la comodità del letto e la gentilezza della reception (in particolare Micheal). a parte questo non potrei dare altri giudizi visto che non abbiam fatto neppure un pasto all'interno della struttura (la colazione costa dai 26 ai 33 dollari). dovessimo tornare a NY andremmo sicuramente in un'altra struttura...peccato, siamo un po' delusi. El hotel está fenomenalmente ubicado y puedes ir andando a los principales puntos de interés de la ciuidad. Nuestra habitación amplia y con una decoración clásica-decadente que le dan su encanto. \\nDentro del hotel está una de las mejores hamburgueserías de la ciudad. Nunca podrías imaginar que en un hotel clásico y pudieses encontrar detrás de una puerta un garito de lo mas auténtico. \\nEstuvimos muy cómodos ルームカテゴリーをアップして、セントラルパークビューの部屋にされることをオススメします。すっきりとした部屋で清潔に保たれているという以外は特筆すべき点はありません。１階にあるハンバーガーはオススメです。朝食はとても高い割に質がともなっていないので、近くのスターバックスでニューヨークらしくベーグルとコーヒーを食べながらニューヨーカーを眺める方が楽しかったです。 Wer in New York ein solides, sauberes Hotel in guter Lage sucht ist im Le Parker Meridien gut aufgehoben. Es ist ein größerer Hotelkomplex der gewohnten Standard der Spg group bietet.\\nFür den gleichen Preis kann man manchmal aber auch schon das W buchen welches wesentlich reizvoller ist.\\nDie Zimmer sind eher klein, aber hell und sauber.\\nIm Rezeptionsbereich befindet sich als kleiner Geheimtipp, versteckt hinter einem Vorhang vor dem immer eine Menschenschlange steht eine tolle vielfach ausgezeichnete Burgerbude (es ist eher ein Verschlag der aber durchaus Charakter hat und zur Stadt passt) wo man für 6 US $ einen hervorragenden Burger bekommt. 内装のセンスの良さ、パークビューからのセントラルパークの眺め、1階ハンバーガーの美味しさ、そして5番街を始め、ＭＯＭＡ、ブロードウェイ、セントラルパークへ自由自在の徒歩圏。\\nミュージカルを夜観た後でも女性一人で不安なく徒歩で帰れます。\\nプールが最上階にあり、時差調整や少し身体を動かしたいとき、確か6時からオープンしていたと記憶していますので、次回は是非マンハッタンの空を泳ぎたいと思います。\\nただ、ひとつだけ残念だったことは、体重計がなかったことです。\\n帰国の荷物を量りたかったのですが、リクエストしても　備えていない　との返事でした。\\nでも、逆を言えばそれくらいしか難点を思いあたらないってことですね。 Quelle déception cet hôtel. La seule chose qui soit bien c'est son emplacement près de Central Park. Nous avons vue sur le Park.\\nIl n'y a pas de restaurant sauf un \"recoin burger\"… Il n'y a pas de placard pour ranger ses vêtements juste une penderie. La salle de bains est toute petite et il n'y a pas de sortie de bains, ni de mule de bains. J'ai été obligée de réclamer du shampoing, des cotons à démaquiller, des cotons tiges, etc.\\nTrès mauvais rapport qualité/prix.\\nLe personnel n'est pas aimable, non stylé.\\nLe ménage n'est pas bien fait.\\nJe ne recommande pas cet hôtel. 初めてのNY旅行ということで、アクセスのよさそうなこちらを利用させていただきました。\\n結果は大正解！５番街やセントラルパークはもちろん、タイムズスクエアなども徒歩圏内。地下鉄の駅も近く、どこへ行くにもとても便利でした。\\n　また、すぐ近くにはスタバやDEAN＆DELUCAがあり、朝食を買って毎朝ニューヨーカー気分(？)を味わっていました。\\n　部屋は清潔感があり、シャワーもとても勢いがあって心地よい水圧です。\\n　アメニティはシャンプー＆リンスと石鹸のみでしたが、海外のホテルにはありがちなことだと思うので、個人的にはそこまで気になりませんでした。(ただ、シャンプー＆リンスが一組しかなかったので、次の日にもう一組増やしてもらいました。快く応じてもらえました！)\\n　\\n　また、ホテル１階にあるハンバーガーショップはとても美味しいです！ジューシーなお肉はさすが本場！という感じです。とても気に入って、滞在中２回も食べてしまいました。\\n　今後もNY旅行の機会があれば、次回もこちらを利用したいと思います。他のみなさまの口コミを拝見していると、こちらのホテルは朝食も素晴らしいようなので、ぜひ利用してみたいです。 今回、STARWOODのホームページから予約し4泊しました。\\nハイフロアーのパークビュールーム（34階)で予約しました。\\nお部屋からの眺めはなかなか良かったです。\\n朝目が覚めて朝焼けを見ながら、セントラルパークの緑が\\nどんどん鮮やかになっていく様子がとてもきれいでした。\\nお部屋内はシンプルで使いやすかったです。アイロン台とアイロンが\\nあったのでとっても助かりました！\\n以前口コミで『冷蔵庫の誤請求』について読んでいたので警戒してましたが、\\n今回は特にそういったトラブルもなく快適に過ごすことができました。\\nどういうシステムで冷蔵庫の使用状況を確認しているのかわかりませんが、\\n私はいつもベッドメイキングのチップを枕元に置いておくときに、一言お礼の\\nメモを添えています。だからなのか、今までホテルで不快な思いをしたことが\\nあまりない気がします。\\nホテル内の朝食レストランは高いと聞いていましたが、CAFEはとっても\\n良心的な値段で夜お茶にはもってこいの場所です。コーヒー＄4でした！\\nセントラルパークが近いこともあり、朝の散歩がとても気持ち良かったです。\\n夏のニューヨークは、一歩外に出ると車や人でごった返しているので、ホテルは\\nなるべく静かな場所の方がゆっくりできると思います。\\nタイムズスクエア辺りの滞在だと、明かりがまぶしくて夜も騒々しいのでは\\nないかとおもいました。その点、セントラルパーク近くは静かなのでおすすめです！ L'hotel est très bien situé, à quelques minutes de Central Park meme pas, pouvons aller à Times Square à pieds en marchant. Petit bémol: du coté rue il y a du bruit, mieux vaut il demander une chambre avec vu sur Central Park (plus chèr) mais vraiment cela en vaut de la peine la deuxième fois été formidable avec cette vue. De plus la piscine au tout dernier étage avec un spa sur le toit vaut vraiment le cout malgré le fait que la piscine est petite en soi, le simple fait de se baigner entre les toits des grands buldings fait oublier le reste. Petits connseils: prendre son petit dejeuner au STARBUCK d'en face qui est typiquement américain. A essayer egalement le fameux restaurant situé dans le hall de l'hotel ou des burgueurs delicieux sont proposés mais y aller dès l'ouverture car énormément de monde tout le temps! 2 Blocks vom Central Park entfernt liegt das Hotel in einer Seitenstrasse. Wir hatten ein recht großes Zimmer im 21. Stock. Der Straßenlärm war also nur entfernt zu hören. Das Personal war nett, konnte/wollte allerdings die Minibar im Zimmer nicht reparieren. Bei den Minibarpreisen war das allerdings kein richtiges Problem, zumal um die Ecke ein kleiner Supermarkt und direkt gegenüber vom Hotel ein Starbucks war. Zimmer 279 USD/Nacht geht für die Qualität des Hotels. Kurz vor Abflug wäre es das Doppelte gewesen. Das rechnet sich dann nicht mehr. このホテルは何よりも立地が良いです。セントラルパークまで徒歩数分で、早朝から散歩したりして滞在中気分よく過ごすことができました。地下鉄の駅もすぐ近くに複数あり、どこに移動するのも楽ですし、スタバやドラッグストア等も近くにあります。\\n私たちが滞在した部屋は広さも十分にあって、内装もまったく問題なし。\\nまた、ホテル内のハンバーガー店も利用しました。店内はそれほど広くなくかなり混雑していましたが、宿泊客はすぐに部屋に戻って食べることができるので便利でした。 che dire di un hotel dove arrivi alle 18.30 di sera e la tua stanza non è pronta ?? \\nforse la graziosa impalcatura che copriva l'ingresso già mi aveva messo di cattivo umore, in ogni modo attendere un ora su delle panchette di legno con 3 bimbi piccoli non è stato il massimo.\\nBuona la posizione , il room service , il servizio pulizie e la piscina all'ultimo piano.\\nPolveroso l'arredamento i velluti e le moquette.\\nTutto sommato un albergo decisamente antico in un ottima posizione. A mio parere però decisamente troppo caro per quanto offre Flot hotel med god service og skøn beliggenhed tæt på Central Park og mellem Broadways teaterdistrikt på den ene side og Fifth Avenue på den anden side. Tæt på subway. Das Hotel liegt superzentral. Egal in welche Richtung man Ausflüge unternimmt, es ist alles zu Fuß super erreichbar. Außerdem gibt es ein Starbucks genau gegenüber, Kiosk, Cafes &amp; Co. ebenfalls in wenigen Minuten erreichbar. Die Zimmer waren sauber und äußert geräumig. Leider gab es im Zimmer keine Badeschuhe und Bademantel - ansonsten hätten wir auch den Pool auf dem Dach ausprobieren können. estuvimos 5 noches en le park meridien manhattan cn mi e´posa y dos hijas, el hotel para nuestro gusto salvo la ubicacion que es excellente , en lo que es hoteleria deja mucho que desear, pongo los comentarios\\n1.- al llegar nadie recoge las maletas, tuvimos que pedir q las llevaran a la habitacion\\n2.- nadie nos acompaño ni mostro las caracteristicas del hotel ni los servicios , bar , spa, etc, desayuno\\n3.-.un dia volvimos 8 pm de paseos y los dos cuartos no estaban hechos mi hija que maneja muy bien elñ ingles hizo 4 reclamos, ni siquiera se disculparon\\n4.-el hotel comparte su acceso y hall con la famosa hamburgueseria y un acceso a un esdificio contiguo lo cual hace q siempre hay transito de gente y no tiene un hall o foyer de descanso o espera\\n5.- se ve muy poco personal en el hotel salvo la concerjeria parece mas un edificio de oficinas q hotel\\n6.- cuando hicimos el check out nos presntan unas cuentas de cosnumo de frigo bar x 77 us, les decimos q no consumimos solo pusimos a enfriar nuestras botellas de agua, se nos dice que al abrir o mover el contenido automaticamente se toma como consumo, nunca visto, siempre en toda la hoteleria q he ido se verifica el cosnumo, igualmnete no nos cobraron\\nen resumen salvo la ubicacion nada relevante Wir waren jetzt schon das vierte Mal im LeParker Meridien NY. Aufgrund der sehr zentralen Lage (W 56th str.,, direkt neben der Carnegie Hall) und der für New Yorker Verhältnisse grossen Zimmer werden wr dieses Haus auch immer wieder wählen. Die Tower-Rooms bieten einen tollen Blick in die City oder in Richtung Central Park.\\nZu den Peakzeiten ist es an der Rezeption schon mal richtig voll, aberdie Mitarbeiter sind schnell und gewandt!\\nZum Frühstück kann man ins Hotelrestaurant \"Norma\" gehen, ds ist OK, wenn auch teuer. Tip: einen Block um die Ecke gibt es das \"Mangia\", das ist unser Frühstücksrestaurant. Und für den Kaffe nach dem Austehen gibt es direkt gegenüber des Hotels eine Filiale der grossen amerikanischen Kaffeekette .\\nTaxen gibt es immer vor dem Haus, in die \"Met\" schafft man es in 15 Minuten zu Fuß.\\nUnbedingt den \"Burger Joint\" ausprobieren!\\nAchtung: es ist ein internationales Businesshotel, es ist immer Betrieb! L'albergo è ottimo anche se costa troppo e la tariffa non include l'utilizzo di internet (16 dollari al giorno..).\\nVale la pena per la posizione, la piscina riscaldata con vista mozzafiato all'ultimo piano del palazzo (splendida) e provvista di un bel servizio doccia, spogliatoio, creme, etc..\\nLe camere sono normali, belle, specialmente quelle con vista su central park.\\nRicordatevi di chiedere la camera ad un piano alto perchè in basso si sentono i rumori di costruzione di due grattacieli vicini.\\nNon fate colazione in hotel (carissima) ma allo starbucks di fronte o sull'angolo con la sesta da Zibetto (cappuccio e brioche italiani!).\\nIl servizio concierge è splendido. Sempre gentili ed efficienti anche nel prenotare i ristoranti per la sera (senza sovrapprezzo).\\nPer pranzo, almeno una volta, bisogna provare Burger Joint: splendidi amburger proprio dietro la hall. Scadente la tv ed i canali televisivi offerti. Ottimo il materasso, i cuscini e i prodotti da bagno offerti. Perfect gelegen hotel met drie (!) ingangen en van alle faciliteiten voorzien. Had een hele mooie kamer met Park View en een ruim tweepersoonsbed met een heerlijk matras. Tevens was er een minibar aanwezig, badkamer met bad, televisie en tegen een kleine vergoeding per dag kun je internetten op de kamer. Heb geen gebruik gemaakt van het ontbijt omdat ik erg vroeg op was door het tijdsverschil maar aan de overkant van het hotel zit een Starbucks waar ik 's ochtends vroeg al terecht kon voor koffie en ontbijt.\\nHet personeel is erg vriendelijk en behulpzaam en dankzij Reina van de Front Desk is mijn verblijf extra feestelijk geworden door een extra attentie welke zij op m'n kamer had laten bezorgen vanwege een speciale gelegenheid. Kortom een hele goede aanrader voor een onvergetelijk verblijf in the city that never sleeps! 119 West 56thと57th Streetの間にあり、5Avのブランド街、タイムズスクエアまで歩いて10分以内という立地のよさ。セントラルパークも部屋から眺めることが出来る。\\n最上階のプールも早朝から開いていて、宿泊客は無料で利用可能で。\\nNewyorkerの気分を味わえる\\n買い物にビジネスに最適だろう。\\nSPG会員ならば、お得に宿泊できる。\\n１Fのレストランの朝食、ロビー脇のハンバーガーショップもNYでは有名店。 Y avons séjourné 2 fois en 2 ans (une dizaine de jours chaque fois) et la qualité est toujours au rendez-vous ! Sans parler de la convivialité, du service irréprochable, de la gentillesse et de la politesse du personnel qui vous aide en toute occasion. J'adore la télé dans l'ascenseur, les couloirs \"moelleux\" et intimes, la piscine au dernier étage (un must pour débuter la journée et pour apaiser vos muscles après avoir marché pendant des heures dans cette ville extraordinaire), la vue sur Central Park, les hamburgers du Burger Joint et l'emplacement de l'hôtel (à 2 pas de Central Park et des métros).\\nOn y retournera ! Nicht nur die Lage des Parker Meridien großartig, um die Ecke des Central Parks sondern auch daß es für New Yorker Maßstab große Zimmer hat.Das Zimmer war geräumig und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Das Hotelteam und der Service waren sehr kompetent und freundlich. Jedes mal wieder sehr gerne in Parker Meridien. うわさでは聞いていましたが、朝食のすばらしさにはびっくり。量は多かったですが、とてもきれいで、今日は何にしようかと、楽しかったです。セントラルパークが望め、交通の便もよかったです。ベットも寝心地がよかったです。ロビー脇のお店のハンバーガーもおいしかったです。 37階パークビューに案内されました。部屋はきれい。バスタブあり。アメニティはPeter Thomas　Rothというブランド。チボリオーディオの時計つきラジオ。ipod　DOGなし。このホテルはチェックインに2時間も待たされました。また、SPG　Plutinumであっても部屋のアップグレード以外に朝食、ラウンジなどのサービスは一切ありません。またポッドがない。冷蔵庫はあるが、使い勝手が悪い。（動かすと加算されるみたい。）無料の水すらない。年末カウントダウンのため周りは封鎖されますが、かといってボールドロップが見えるわけでもないので不便です。 Belle vue sur le park. Restaurant plus souvent fermé qu'ouvert ! (excepté pour celui qui ne propose que des hamburgers) Prix de petit déjeuner excessif mais c'est NY !\\nImpossible de prendre un apéro dans le petit bar par manque de place (toutes occupées des heures par des branchés \"internet\" ) pas de service dans le hall.\\nUn hôtel de passage ... sans âme. Hotel tres bien situe, pres de tout, central park, la 5ieme Av. Time square. A notre arriver dans la chambre il y avait un probleme avec la toillette, nous avons appeler et ils sont venu immediatement reparer le tout. A noter, internet est payant a 17$ par jour... je ne comprend pas. Es-ce que je conseille cet hotel, pour affaire dans cette section de la ville oui mais pour loisir non. L'hotel è in una posizione molto strategica per visitare manhattan, le camere non sono grandissime, c'è la vasca ma non la doccia da sola. Le camere sono molto pulite. se possibile fatevi dare la camera dal 20esimo piano in su per una vista migliore. E infine... andate a vedere cosa c'è dietro la tenda a fianco del conciergierie all'ingresso...buonissimo!!! vado spesso a New york per lavoro e non ero mai stato prima al Parker Meridien.\\nNe sono rimasto deluso.\\nIl rapporto qualità-prezzo è assolutamente negativo.\\nle stanze sono piccole e con una strana console centrale nella quale è inserita la televisione che ne riduce ulteriormente lo spazio.\\nIl personale è poco cortese.\\nLa connessione internet costa 16 dollari mentre in un albergo così caro dovrebbe essere gratis.\\nLa posizione è ottima.\\nInsomma, si trovano alberghi migliori ad un prezzo decisamente più conveniente. Mi marido y yo estuvimos alojados en el Parker Meridien una semana durante el mes de agosto. Teníamos reservada una habitación estandar pero cuando llegamos al hotel, un sábado a las 8 de la tarde, nos dijeron que estábamos de suerte porque nos iban a dar una habitación superior a la que teníamos contratada. Nos llevamos una grata sorpresa, la habitación estaba en el piso 25, tenía dos estancias muy amplias, un baño grande... parecía un mini apartamento! Todo limpísimo y muy bonito. El armario era amplio, con dos grandes cajones y se encendia la luz al abrirlo.\\nHe de decir que una de las cosas que más nos gustó fue lo bien que se descansaba, la cama era enorme y comodísima, había mucho silencio y se dormía fenomenal.\\nLas instalaciones del hotel son muy bonitas. El hall es precioso. Los ascensores, muy lujosos, con una pantalla plana en el interior en la que no paran de proyectar películas de Charlotte y Tom y Jerry.\\nEl personal fue muy amable en todo momento. Un día necesité un adaptador para la luz y me dieron varios para probar porque los primeros que me dieron no eran compatibles con mi cámara de fotos. \\nEn la habitación había dos paraguas. No obstante, teníamos concertada una excursión a Washington y la mañana que fuimos llovía mucho, no habíamos cogido los paraguas y los recepcionistas nos facilitaron dos muy amablemente.\\nRespecto a la ubicación, inmejorable. Puedes ir andando a muchos sitios, da la sensación de estar cerca de todo.\\nNo llegamos a subir a la piscina ni visitamos la hamburguesería.\\nEn resumen, una excelente elección. Se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. 10月に2日間滞在しました。部屋からセントラルパークが見え、昼間はとてもきれいでしたが、夜は真っ暗でした。ニューヨークのホテルの割には部屋は広めです。ただ、入り口が工事中で、これが高級ホテル？という感じでした。最上階にプールがあるので、これに期待していたのですが、プールというより、水遊びをする場という感じでした。子連れの親子が遊んでいる感じで、泳いでいる人はいませんでした。10メートルくらいの大きさです。\\nただ、ここからみるセントラルパークは素晴らしかったです。ロケーションは抜群です。\\nアメリカのホテルなのに、コーヒーポットの備え付けがなく、不便でしたので、デパートで買いました。日本と同じ2口のものでしたが、日本に持って帰ったら、微妙に違っていて使えませんでした。\\nちなみに、ポットの貸し出しを聞いたら、ルームサービスで、お湯を頼むしかないと言われました。宿泊料が高い割にいまひとつのホテルでした。 Abbiamo avuto il piacere di soggiornare in quest Hotel fantastico. Cortesia, pulizia e comodità oltre al fatto che ha una posizione invidiabile. Avevamo la camera con vista mozafiato sul Central Park. In due minuti sulla 5th Avenue in 10 minuti nel cuore di Times Square. Ritorneremo con molto piacere. Hotel zeichnet sich durch seine Lage- Central Park/ Times Square 10 Min- aus. Stock 25 war früher Raucherbereich und riecht man immer noch. Zimmer ab Stockwerk 28 mit Parkview zu empfehlen, wenn auch höherer Preis. Frühstück Menue grosse Auswahl aber saftige Preise, Bedienung freundlich u. bemüht. Reception teilweise überfordert u. unterschiedlich qualifiziert. Ho trovato ottimo quest'albergo. Fra tutti quelli che ho frequentato a NY ha sicuramente le stanze più grandi. I concierges sono molto bravi e esaudiscono ogni richiesta.\\nLa posizione è ottima per visitare al meglio Manhattan.\\nE' un po' caro, ma negli standard di NY.... sempre molto cara. \\nNon fate colazione in albergo: potreste pagare 30 dollari per un caffè e due croissants! Hôtel très bien situé géographiquement\\nAmbiance feutrée.\\nPersonnel très accueillant et serviable. hola queria expresar mi opinion pq veo que hay mucha gente que se pasa criticando los hoteles por cositas de nada y van buscando pequeños errores para criticar todos los sitios que han estado. Por cual de esta gente casi cambio de hotel y me hubiese arrepentido toda mi vida pq me hubiera jodido toda mi luna de miel ya que el cambio que estuve apunto de hacer me habria salido peor . Gracias que elegi este hotel.\\nEste hotel lo tiene todo para disfrutar de tus vacaciones en nyc buen servicio, muy limpio, buenas instalaciones(incluida la piscina), muy buenas habitaciones( la cama grande y comodisima), muy bien situado y encima tienes las mejores hamburguesas de todo nyc en la recepcion. certes bien placé pour visiter N.Y mais il vaut mieux réserver un hotel 3 *, les chambres ne sont pas grandes contrairement à ce que l'on pourrait penser en voyant les photos, seul le hall est \"tape à l'oeil\" , les petits dej excessifs (17 dol), quant à la piscine nous n'avons pas eu le temps d'y aller !! Sie finden im Le Parker Meridien Hotel in New York ein ideales Hotel als Ausgangspunkt fuer Ihre Sightseeing Tour.\\nAllerdings hat es einen sehr teuren Preis fuer eine durchschnittliche Leistung.\\nFuer den gleichen Preis gibt es wesentlich bessere Hotels. Wir hatten mehr erwartet, was die Zimmerausstattung und das Ambiente betrifft.\\nSehr schoen ist der Pool im 42. Stock mit hervorragender Aussicht. Ich fand nicht nur die Lage des Parker Meridien großartig, um die Ecke des Central Parks sondern auch daß es für New Yorker Maßstab große Zimmer hat. Meisten verbirgt sich hinter der Zimmertür ja ein Bett, neben dem kein Platz mehr für die Reisetasche ist. Hier was das anders. Das Zimmer war geräumig und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Das Hotelteam war nett und zuvorkommed. Im obersten Stockwerk gib es ein Schwimmbad und eine Aussichtsplatform von der man eine tolle Sicht hat. Ich würde hier jederzeit wieder absteigen! Hotel elegante in ottima posizione per shopping e visite alla città. Personale disponibile, camere ampie ed essenziali per il soggiorno. Absolut zentral gelegen, am Central Park, 10 min zu Fuß zum Times square, Schwimmbad im Haus, für 60 $ nach JFK und Newark. U-Bahn vor der Tür und (für NYC) akzeptable Preise. Zimmer mit Parkblick sind für 40$ pro Nacht buchbar. Der Roomservice ( wie so oft) recht teuer. Zum frühstücken geht am am besten um die Ecke in ein deli. Wir waren bereits zum zweiten mal dort und werden beim nächsten NYC Trip wieder dort absteigen. Tolle Betten, ich war schon 5mal da. Es ist immer wieder angenehm, nicht billig aber \\nangenehmes Hotel. Außer die Aufzüge, meistens gehen nur 2 von 3. Da wenn man ein\\nStockwerk weit oben bewohnt, ist es nervig. Frühstück ist immer extra, sehr gehobener Preis. \\nDer Check in ist immer mit Wartezeit verbunden. Wir waren als größere private Reisegruppe - vier Erwachsene, drei kleine Kinder - in New York. Das Hotel ist für diese Zielgruppe sehr gut geeignet, auch wegen der kurzen Wege zum Central Park, weiteren Attraktionen sowie zur U-Bahn. Hautattraktion für unsere Kinder war der schöne Pool auf dem Dachgeschoss des Hotels mit Blick über die Stadt, den man auch von einer Dachterrasse genießen kann. In den Zimmern hatte alles mit der Vorbereitung (z.B. Kinderwiege) geklappt. Im Erdgeschoss lockt insbesondere eine sehr schöne, szenige Kaffeebar. Wir werden auf jeden Fall bei unserem nächsten NYC-Aufenthalt in dieses Hotel gehen. Le Parker Meridien a un avantage indéniable : une position idéale au coeur de Manhattan, à proximité de nombreux centres d'intérêt (musée, restaurants, shopping, Central Park, 5th Avenue...). C'est un bon hôtel, le lobby est agréable, la piscine avec vue panoramique sur Central Park est très sympa et appréciable pour se rafraîchir après une longue journée. Le petit restaurant Burger Joint, caché dans le lobby, est décalé et mérite sa réputation de meilleur burger de NYC. \\nNotre chambre était spacieuse, avec une superbe vue sur Central Park, magique ! \\nAménagement assez basique, voire manquant quelque peu de modernité, mais suffisant.\\nOn peut regretter simplement, pour un hôtel 4 étoiles, l'absence de peignoir et mules dans les salles de bains. Autres bémols : salle de sport payant, wifi payant dans les chambres.\\nUn bon hôtel de chaine en somme, dont je garderai un bon souvenir. Für alle die mit Familie reisen sowohl von der Lage, den Fazilitäten, dem Service und den Mitarbeitern gesehen eine Top-Adresse auf höchstem Niveau. Klasse und Stil verbinden sich mit einer für diese Metropole fast familiären Atmosphäre. Besonders zu erwähnen ist die fantastische Chef-Concierge Frau Maria Bortoluzzi, deren Kompetenz und Freundlichkeit herausragend ist. Bereits zum zweiten Mal wählte ich dieses Hotel als Ausgangspunkt für die Erkundung New Yorks. Die Lage ist wirklich ideal wenn man nicht unbedingt am lautesten Platz New Yorks nächtigen möchte - das Hotel liegt in Midtown. \\nVom Hotel aus hat man zum Central Park einen Fußweg von ca. 5 und zum Times Square von 10 Minuten. Zwei Ubahnstationen liegen nahezu um die Ecke. \\nDas Hotel zeichnet sich durch nettes Personal und saubere Zimmer aus. Der Service ist genauso wie man es sich von einem Hotel der Meridien-Kette wünscht. Was ich persönlich nicht so toll fand war der Fitness-Bereich. Da es ein \"öffentlicher\" Fitnessclub im Basement des Gebäudes ist muss man selbst als Hotelgast dafür extra bezahlen. \\nUm sportlich fit zu bleiben empfehle ich jedem den hauseigenen Pool auf dem Dach des Buildings - der ist nämlich kostenlos. Von dort aus hat man übrigens auch einen wunderschönen Blick über die Dächer New Yorks. \\nSehr zu empfehlen ist auch das \"Burger\"-Restaurant im Hotel - ein absoluter Geheimtipp, der es mittlerweile sogar in Reiseführer geschafft hat. Todo bien , me gusto mucho el Hotel . \\nLo unico malo es que pague por una habitacion con vista al Central Park , y me dieron una habitacion con vista contraria . \\nNo es lo que me ofrecieron , ni es lo que yo pague . \\nAscensores MUY LENTOS Hallo,\\ndas Hotel Le Parker in New York City war sein Geld wert! Es liegt sehr zentral, fast unmittelbar am Central Park und kann getrost als First Class Hotel bewertet werden - lässt es sich aber auch bezahlen. \\nWir haben beispielsweise auf das angebotene Frühstück verzichtet, da es exorbitant teuer war und man im Starbucks, o.ä. genauso gut etwas zu sich nehmen kann!\\nDas Hotel bietet ein unvergleichliches Extra: es besitzt einen Penthouse Pool, von dem aus man einen herlichen Blick über den Centralpark genießen kann. Er ist nicht der größte seiner Art, aber sehr sehr schön.\\nAbstriche muss man beim Komfort der Aufzüge und Hotelflure machen, die waren rel eng, dunkel und nicht wirklich super gepflegt!\\nDie angestellten hingegen waren nett und die Zimmer waren modern und sauber!\\nAlles in allem eine nicht gerade günstige, aber doch empfehlenswerte Bleibe für einen Trip in die Stadt die wirklich niemals schläft!!! Il a fallu insister pour passer du 6ème étage (glauque, sans aucune vue, bruyant, au dessus des moteurs de climatisation) au 41ème étage, mais ça a été possible.\\nPas grand chose à dire d'autre, là haut c'est évidemment très bien...\\nLa pîscine au 42ème pas mal non plus, même si horriblement chlorée, et à l'équipement un peu cheap (schampoing non remplacé, balance déglinguée, etc...)\\nHall très vivant, bons hamburgers (chers quand même) servis dans une sorte d'antre bien cachée... Bon quartier, ... Quelque francophone fort utile... Wir waren Christmas 2009 5 Tage in New York City. Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut, Nähe des Central Park. Man kann viele Sehenswürdigkeiten und Geschäfte zu Fuß erreichen. Das Hotel ist sauber, die Zimmer gut ausgestattet und verhältnismäßig groß. Das Frühstück im Hotelrestaurant Normas allerdings viel zu teuer und nicht besonders. 8 nuits au Parker Méridien : idéal pour tous les déplacements des touristes que nous sommes! à 2 blocks de CPark, 10 de Times Square... merveille des merveille : la vue du rooftop, magnifique! des transats à disposition pour prendre ses petits déj (achetés au starbuck d'en face) ou boire un coca après une journée épuisante. Piscine agréable avec vue sur les building\\nmais mais...pas de coffee maker dans les chambres, dur dur le matin...\\nsuite junior pour 4? décoration soignée mais où sont les placards de rangement?\\npetit déj au Norma : chiquissime mais cherissime!! (délicieux néanmoins)\\nenfin un bar top sans oublier une équipe de concierge adorable &amp; plein de bons conseils Arredamento moderno pulito, centralissimo e con un centro fitness incredibile.\\nLo consiglio assolutamente !!!!! 久しぶりにビジネスで訪れたＮＹで宿泊したホテル。セントラルパークに近い、ミッドタウンに位置して、街歩きには何かと便利なロケーションです。プライベートの自由時間が限られる中、効率的に必要なものを手に入れたり、実際に歩き回るために書き出したto-doリストをもとに、ホテルのコンセルジェに相談すると、明快かつプラスアルファの回答を出してくれ、見事に120％目標達成できました。 Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre semaine dans cet hôtel, nous ne regrettons qu'une\\nchose, et c'est toujours pareil dans cette catégorie d'hôtel, malgré un prix très élevé pour\\nles chambres, il faut encore ajouter des frais pour Internet, c'est incroyable!!!\\nNous n'arrivons pas à comprendre.... NYCらしい装飾を抑えたシックなホテルですが、スタッフのサービスもよいです。\\nなにより、適度な高級感のあるホテルで、バックステージのようにカーテンの裏に隠れたハンバーガー店がおすすめです。\\nオーダーの仕方は、まず焼き方と中身を伝えてから、自分の名前を伝えます。出来上がった時に名前をよばれます。（たまにナンパ目的で２度呼ばれたりして）\\nおすすめは\"meduium rare\" と\"eveything\"。肉汁がいっぱいのハンバーガーです。ポテトもおいしいです。（ナンパ目的で貰いました）\\nセントラルパークを望めるParkViewのお部屋は、立地上数部屋しかないようですが、ハネムーナーが前もって予約をしていた部屋を拝見させてもらったところ、都会の中で緑がまぶしい、とてもいいお部屋でした。\\n日本のミュージシャンもお一人でお泊まりされていたのをみかけましたよ。 Estuvimos en él a mediados de agosto de 2010. Lo elegimos por la recomendación que nos hicieron desde El Corte Inglés, y pagamos una diferencia importante con respecto a otros hoteles como el Intercontinental. Escogimos esta opción pensando que sin estar en medio de Times Square ni otras atracciones turísticas y estando cerca de Central Park, su ubicación disfrutaría de una zona poco ruidosa. sin embargo, el hotel no cubrió nuestras expectativas. La tarde que entramos solicitamos que nos cambiaran hasta tres veces de habitación por el ruido. Al final nos dieron una habitación en uno de los pisos superiores y bueno, ni tan mal. pero el ruido es una de sus características principales, no sólo el exterior (ventanas sin insonorizar), sino el provocado por el sistema de ventilación interno. pensamos que hoteles de esta categoría deberían estar preparados para poder dormir mejor después de intensas jornadas a pie, pero bueno era nuestra primera visita a Nueva York y no sabemos si existen remansos se paz a tal efecto en la Gran Manzana. Por lo demás, el hotel era correcto. por cierto nos atendió en castellano Rafael en la recepción, todo amabilidad y cordialidad. Hay otros conserjes que son un poco cardos, sobre todo si no hablas un inglés acorde al que esperan sus excelencias. la piscina está muy bien y tiene un gran servicio de personal. las habitaciones también están bien, sin grandes alardes, pero correctas. abajo tiene un lugar en el que dicen servir las mejores hamburguesas de Nueva York. estando buenas, tampoco son la octava maravilla del mundo, pero están bien. Pagamos alrededor de 40 dólares para dos personas si no recuerdo mal. Si puedes, huye como alma que lleva el diablo del 'Centro de Negocios' para meterte a internet. por tema profesional, tuve que utilizar durante media hora el servicio y me cobraron 50 dólares. un abuso, pero esto es New York, amigos. también nos sentó muy mal que al regreso, el hotel nos incluyó en la relación de gastos de la tarjeta de crédito una cantidad al hacer el check in (200 dólares más o menos). al parecer lo hacen como hábito, por seguridad o lo que sea y no nos lo cobraron finalmente. algo increíble porque nosotros ya habíamos pagado el viaje al Corte Inglés. también hicimos un circuito con esta compañía de cuatro días de duración a Niagara, Toronto, Washington y Philadelphia. Un auténtico sacadineros porque aún teniendo pagado todo, los del circuito te cobran por todo tipo de excursiones inventadas. no nos gustó el estilo. Aunque el guía era sabía mucho, era bastante pesado y quería sacarte pasta por todos lados. Además terminaron pidiéndonos propinas. Muy feo, a pesar de que esta sociedad se mueva con este sistema 'propineril'. Un saludo y feliz estancia en Nueva York. Pase lo que pase, el viaje siempre merece la pena. Albergo di grandi dimensioni e con un numero di presenze rilevante, non ci si deve aspettare di essere coccolati dal personale perchè le dimensioni non lo consentono; ottima posizione per muoversi in autonomia a Manhattan. ここの朝食は優雅に時間をかけて食べるのをお勧め。セットメニューが２０種類以上から選べて、内容も素晴らしい。朝から優雅な気分になれるでしょう。フロントスタッフも親切で丁寧。ポーターも申し分なく、ビジネスで優雅に過ごしたいならここのホテルがお勧めです。 Pour quoi pas une petite folie?\\nLe Parker Méridien est situé tout proche de Central Park et de la 5eme avenue.\\nLa particularité qui vaut le détour: la piscine couverte sur le toit avec une vue panoramique sur central park!\\nSinon, chambre très confortable, room service efficace mais cher, bar design... Certes cet hôtel est bien placé (tout près de Central Park) et la vue de certaines chambres est très agréable, mais là s'arrêtent les points positifs. Nous avions réservé 2 chambres, nous avons eu la 1ère à 15h et la 2ème à 22h, c'est long quand on a voyagé et que l'on a 6 heures de décalage horaire ! Le service est inexistant, le petit déjeuner est hors de prix pour la qualité. Quant à la piscine, nous n'avons pas eu nous y tremper, elle était envahie par un groupe d'enfants qui semblait venir d'un \"centre aéré\" de la banlieue new-yorkaise. Das Hotel is masslos ueberbewertet - auf keinen Fall ein 5 Sterne Haus. Misserable Zimmer in der Deluxe Category, triple Bett war ein Feldbett, die Zimmergroesse max 10 qm, das Badezimmer alt und grau. Nach Protest wurde uns ein neues ZImmer zugewiesen, etwas groesser, aber das triple Bett war wieder ein Felbett. Noch nochmaligen Protest haben wir dann ein akzeptables Zimmer bekommen, aber erst nachdem wir mir dem Manger on Duty gesprochen haben. Das Hotel ist gelinde gesagt als 5 Sterne Hause eine Zumutung.

Great bar too. The service was great, the location was great we were able to walk to Per Se for dinner which made it a great night. The hotel is an excellent elegant choice when in New York ! The staff was great and the hotel look beautiful during Christmas -- and don't forget to hit up the burger joint ! The hotel is in walking distance to Central Park area, Time Square, 30 Rock, and all the Shopping you can handle Long story short. Both bathroom sink and toilet was clogged. Front desk assitant manager - Margaret was rude in unrelated matter. Call to speak to general manager after stay. Spoke to Josette, \"executive assistant\" in great lengths. I asked for a refund, she said no, she may be able to do a partial refund and would have to get back to me. Spoke to her later and she said she never said she could do a partial refund and said I misunderstood. All the while, the General Manager never called back. If the the General Manager thinks she is too important for a guest, then I will never stay there again. They can keep the money. My second stay at Le Parker Meridien was as pleasant as the first. While I find some of the super hip stuff irritating, the service is great, as is the location of the hotel. This time, I had chance to use the gym, which is well equipped and has a great juice bar. Large rooms, a bit cold decoration though. Fantastic bed, to me. Very kind service, great location. Burger joint is just a myth, don't waist your time in the long lines. Just average hamburger. Baths refurbished in a nice way. Cafeteria is warm and comfortable. I didn't have any meal in the hotel. We have been travelling to New York several times a year for decades, and after much trial and error, have found a \"home\" at Le Parker Meridien. Its location is ideal: a few blocks from Central Park, Park Avenue, 1/2 block from Carnegie Hall, and a 1-minute walk to Times Square. Several subway lines are 1/2 block away, so we can get to the Village or Brooklyn easily. The \"scene\" is professional but with enough glamour to make us feel like we are someplace special. We try to stay in Starwood Hotels when we can but the extra French touches of Le Parker Meridien are welcome here. During the day, Looney Toons cartoons play on the elevator TV screens; at night there are black & white videos of Thelonius Monk and other jazz legends. We used to stay at the Peninsula - l loved my daily swim in their rooftop pool. But with their prices >$800 per night, that's out of our range these days. But Le Parker Meridien has one too!! Finally, there is a secret restaurant with no sign, off the lobby, selling the best burgers in Manhattan. The only sign it is there is the line coming out the door. There is simply no better hotel in New York for the money. Friends and I decided to go up to NYC for the weekend over Thanksgiving and were fortunate to get this hotel through Priceline.\\nWe are Starwood members and they upgraded both of us to higher rooms. My friend got upgraded to a suite and I got upgraded to a room with a beautiful view of Central Park.\\nThe staff was very friendly and the rooms were extremely nice and clean.\\nThe location of the hotel was great. Only a few blocks away from Time Square, Hell's Kitchen, and Central Park. I've stayed here before so I was looking forward to returning. The check-in was a breeze. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient. The room service food (French Onion Soup & Mini Greens salad) were absolutely perfect. The swimming pool was nice, but it is in need of an up-grade. It's not the cleanest pool in the world and they don't enforce any kind of diaper policy - so kids in saggy diapers are in there all the time. Also, there is a $10 fee for using the pool. Normas restaurant had lovely food, but the service was a bit contrived. The host was arrogant. Also I sat for 20 minutes before anyone offered me coffee or juice. It took another 45 minutes to get my food and coffee. I was just starting the food when the waiter slapped down the bill and told me he would take the payment. I thought that was a bit much. On the other hand, the bar there is lovely ... sort of The Russian Tea Room meets Amman, Jordan ... with friendly, beautiful wait staff. My wife and I were just there for two nights this past weekend. Pluses: Great location one block from Carnegie Hall, Easy subway to Theatre district and Lincoln cente3r. Famous for its burgers, but long waiting line to get in. Swimming pool on rooftop ($10/day); luxury linens and down duvet and pillows. LED reading lights by bed and desk allowed reading without disturbing others. Lots of breakfast places on 56th St, and on 7th Ave -- all had good croissants. Minus: inadequate staffing at front desk made for long lines; calling concierge from room got no answer; $15/day charge for wi-fi; We preferred the Park Central -- less expensive same location, better service. Everything expected from a top hotel. Beautifully decorated for the holidays, close to all the great shopping. Extensive gourmet room service menu and Norma's is an experience in itself. Upgrade to a Tower room for a spectacular view. Already planning our next stay... Le Parker Meridein NY lived up to all my expectations. Great service, Amazing room with incredible views and the best location in NYC. Also, if you have a chance, go to the burger joint in the lobby. Absolutely the best burgers in NYC. You would never expect this place to be in that type of hotel. Unexpected surprises are what NYC is all about and LPM offers the greatest example of this. my second stay and will be back\\nthe location the bar the burger, the rooftop has a great view\\n your not going to find a better place for any price\\nwe had a ball , clean friendly and very good service. the russian tea room is next door for a night cap. This hotel has passable facilities, but the service for the most part is terrible. Let me list a few examples from the times that I've stayed at the hotel.\\n- Front desk staff has terrible attitude, rude.\\n- Additional charge for anything extra - fridge, microwave, etc.\\n- Asked us for additional charge just to borrow some wine glasses! \\n- Burger Joint is overpriced for the portion size. Stayed at Le Parker Meridien for a night when in town for a quick New York City Christmas fix. Lobby on the 57 St. side was PACKED. Tip: try to come in on the 56th St. side much easier than dragging your bags through the bar they how have set up at the 57th St entrance. Check in was quick and I got a room in the tower. Room was decent sized for NYC, but had the oddest closet, a tiny cupboard like affair with a curtain to close it off. I was in for one night by myself, so no problem for me, but if I'd been with my wife there would not have been nearly enough closet space. And, with the safe at the bottom and the ironing board in the tiny spot for longer items like overcoats or long dresses there was no room for such clothes. if this is important, I would check at desk for something with a better closet before you check in. Perhaps this was just what I got being a single for a one-nighter.\\nFor me the midtown location is great and the hotel is only a few blocks from several subway entrances. Cabs were good (except during the dreaded early evening hours, which is true everywhere in midtown) and are on the 56th St. side. Lunch or dinner tip: Out that 56th St. door and turn right (west) for a reasonably-priced Thai restaurant, Topaz, just 10 yards down the street, perfect when it's raining. Breakfast tip: Out the 57 st. door, turn left (west) and walk the 1/2 block to 7th, then up a block and on the west side of the street is a coffee shop, La Parisien. Though it has nothing to do with French food, a perfectly adequate spot to get eggs or whatever at a fraction of the hotel's prices.\\nI found the service very good, the little that I needed it, with everyone efficient and polite. Bed was very comfy, all the usual items worked well in the room which was spotless and decently decorated.\\nI'd go back again any time. Went up and back from DC for a trip that lasted less than 24 hours and this hotel was booked for us. Stayed one night, had breakfast the next morning at the Waldorf and lunch at the Four Seasons, then back to DC in the afternoon on the train. Pretty good trip except for this hotel.\\nIn a nutshell, all I am willing to devote, the lobby was splendid, including the gingerbread rendition of Carnegie Hall with the crane hanging overhead during storm Sandy. They called it \"The Hurri-Crane\" and it should win a prize. The room was small, sleek, cold and impersonal. On the plus side there was a killer view out the window from the 32nd floor. We dropped our bags and headed back downstairs for dinner. Guess what? No restaurant. We decided to go to the bar and have a glass of wine and ponder possibilities. Guess what? No room at the bar, where you have to be seated. Then we decided to try The Burger Joint, a dive-themed burger joint off the main lobby. There was a line and we were tired of lines. Back to the room and the room service menu. BLT's and a bottle of wine arrived 30 minutes later. For a hotel that charges a fortune,nthe only things worth comment werenthat gingerbread construction, the view and the wine, a very nice Syrah. I can find other hotels in this price range that deliver a much better experience for the same price. I have stayed at this property before but I usually don't because I don't need to be in midtown when I go to NYC. That being said, if you need to be in midtown, the hotel is in a good location. Rooms with city views are on the small side and even the \"suites\" are nothing to write home about. And if you need to open your window for ventilation, you will not sleep! It is noisy!\\nCompared to other SPG properties in NYC, this one is a notch below in terms of quality and service.\\nSo if you get a good rate, go for it. As a couple with a 2 years old little girl, we were excited to spend a night in the heart of Manhattan. We booked a junior suite with kitchenette for 1,009.00 dollars plus 154.33 dollars taxes. For this price you can really expect something more than just decent and guess what we got....a small and poorly furnished room with a tiny living room....but the worst is yet to come.....the kitchenette was only a sink with a microwave....there was not a single plate, glass, knife, fork or spoon...if you want to have these items, you have to order them and pay 5 dollars each to have the right to use them...more than a thousand dollars for a room with kitchenette and all the silverware costs extra....total RIP-OFF...we were treated like S--T, shame on Le Parker Meridien, definitely not a family oriented hotel, this is the worst of its class in NYC Very disappointed in the staff at this hotel. They could care less. Its a problem at many NYC hotels but this place takes it to a new level. The problem is it is a tight hotel market and it is sad to say I am paying $700 a night and I don t get much back.\\nSome things like showing up at night and there is no bellman to help with bags. A front desk staff that is very poorly trained. A pathetic night manager Mona who has no concept that she is in the hospitably business. Her English skills are poor and her people skills are worse. Come back from being gone all day and our room was not cleaned. Road noise from the street is the loudest I have experienced from My 20 plus years coming to the city.\\nThe Management of this hotel should embarrassed but the fact is they are the problem. Every employee I come in contact with could give a crap.\\n$15 for internet. I will include a photo of what looks like mold. What is wrong with this world when a major hotel chain in a major U.S. city can pull this kind of bait and switch ?\\nStarwood should be ashamed this place falls in every way. You can do better move on to another property. I would defintly recommend the Le Parker Meridien to anyone visiting NY. When I arrived I was greeted by the doorman who helped me bring in my luggage and showed me to the front desk. The front desk had my reservations and told me about the restaurants and Burger joint located in the hotel so I would be able to have dinner late which was great since I was expecting my brother around 10pm from his fight. I was helped by the bellman who told me about the ammenties offered by the hotel which may be helpful during my stay as well as how great the burgers are at burger joint which by the way are fantastic and I love the fact their open late. I loved Norma's which has the best orange juice and give you great portions of mouth watering food seriously! I loved the stuffed berry waffles with berry brulee and banana macadamia pancakes which were amazing!! The concierge was extremely helpful with the events I planned and also gave me great information on other things I may want to do!! I love NY during the holidays and everything is within walking distance. To the parade route to the great stores which were decorated with great Christmas decor. The rooms were very clean and loved the modern theme. From checking in to my stay the hotel covers everything. I would stay there again and next time I would take advantage of the gym and rooftop pool as well as the blowdry bar which I thought was great idea. My brother thought the barbershop was also great and would take advantage of it the next time we visit! The hotel is in a great spot in NY, however the rooms are horrible for two distinct reasons......the pillows smell like the last person staying here and the heat is unbearable. I am writing this in my hotel room during my stay. To simply put my problem with this location:\\n1) When I lay down on the bed, it would be nice if the pillow did not smell like it has been used for ten years. Very Nauseating.\\n2) Even though it is cold outside, it is torture to require your guests to sleep in 75 degree rooms with no ventilation. I'm sorry I am incorrect....there is a thermostat that supposedly allows you to turn on the AC. No matter the temp you set it at.....hot air blows out of the vent. TORTURE!!!!!\\nFinally this morning they sent engineering in to open my window.....Trust me I tried on my own...required a screwdriver to get the safety window open.\\nI could understand a lower cost hotel having these issues.....but for the premium they charge here.....this is insane.....worst night sleep ever. beautiful rooms, fantastic location, great hotel for location to all attractions.\\nwould recommend this to anyone. this hotel was very clean and staff were helpful. if going for the macey's parade this is ideal as the parade was at the bottom of street. Although we don't come from that far away, feeling of welcome that the staff provides really made our stay relaxing and so enjoyable. We love the gingerbread contest and holiday decorations for Christmas. This hotel knows the value of customer service and makes you want to come back again and again. The addition of the wall mounted TVs in the rooms is brilliant as it makes the room a lot larger (plus the quality of the TVs is excellent). We plan to come back again soon. My daughter and I spent 2 nights here at the beginning of December, and had a great stay. The room was spacious for a New York hotel, and very clean. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was fine, though the shower head could use an update. Would have been nice if there was coffee or water in the rooms, but not a deal-breaker. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially the concierge staff. They helped us navigate around what we wanted to do while there. Location was perfect for us, since it was close (walking distance) to all the sites we wanted to get to. The hotel was nicely decorated for the holidays. Hotel was beautiful. The room was bigger than most New York hotel rooms. Which made the stay that much better. Very clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful!! The gym is HUGE and the spa is fantastic We stay two nights and is really nothing bad we can say. Great location, great room, great service, but even that I wasnt feeling that extra that a nice hotel makes u feel. There was always a lot of people around the lobby area, we expect a better decoration in the room but we like it. Have always liked the Parker Meridien. Staff, location, restaurants are all excellent. But for a hotel of this caliber/price, I should be able to adjust the temperature. To add insult to injury, there is a \"bogus\" thermostat in the room to set the temperature but actually does nothing. A call to the \"engineer,\" as suggested on the thermostat confirmed that the only way to cool the room is to open the window. The small opening didn't do much except make it too noisy to sleep. Not being able to sleep turns all the good things bad! Seems like others have similar complaints, so please, Parker Meridien, fix the heating and air conditioning! A wonderful location for a week-end get away to the city..perfectly suited for a week long stay as well. \\nClose enough to Central Park for morning/evening walks, near enough to walk to Wollman ice skating rink in Central Park and Rockfeller Center. \\nGreat for shopping on 5th Ave and seeing the Holiday windows, near enough to Broadway and Lincoln Center. A stones throw away from a wide array of great restaurants that are moderately priced. \\nGreat meeting place to meet up in the \"lounge passage way\". Fantastic hamburger joint in the lobby and just the perfect location overall! This hotel is fantastic - great location, friendly & helpful staff, wonderfully spacious rooms. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Manhattan. Special thanks go to Lisa Tharp who not only made sure that we had rooms close to each other but left us lovely fruit & cheese plates with a friendly welcome note - really nice touch! We really enjoyed our stay at Le Parker Meridien. The hotel location was great. Near Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center, etc. and walking distance to Times Square (close enough, but far enough away from the frenzy of Times Sq) We went there for Thanksgiving weekend and we were also very close to the parade route. We basically watched it from outside the hotel, though we weren't right up front (the parade went down 6th Ave, about 100 yards from our hotel lobby. The indoor pool was great. It is on the top floor, with windows everywhere and beautiful views. There is also a deck you can go out on, during the day. We stayed in a junior suite which was spacious and comfortable for the family. Knave, a coffee bar and lounge is lovely. Very cozy place for a drink. Norma's was expensive but a great menu of yummy and unique breakfast items. We also went to the burger joint which was TINY...it's basically a take out place with some tables if you are lucky enough to get one (we did!) but it is burgers and fries and shakes....and that's it. Yummy, but limited menu. A few negatives we experienced at the hotel....we arrived at 4 pm (check-in was supposed to be at 3 pm) and our room was not ready. We had to wait until 6:30 which was inconvenient. We had been on the road since 9 am that day and just wanted to get settled and rest for a while. The room was nice but we found it to be very HOT. We couldn't get the room to cool down the first night. The following day we called maintenance. THey came and said the only way they could lower the temperature was to open the windows. A little strange, but seemed to work a little bit. The windows only open about 6 inches, which was a good thing as we were on the 37th floor with children. Seems to me the hotel should have a better cooling system, right?? I heard several complaints from other people about how hot the hotel was, so it is clearly a problem the hotel should address for the satisfaction of their customers. Another inconvenience was that there was no coffee makers in the room. If the hotel chooses not to have coffee makers in the room, that is fine, but I think at the very least they should have urns of free coffee in the lobby. Especially a hotel of this caliber, and on Thanksgiving Day/holiday weekend! There is a Starbucks right across the street, which I went to each morning. But the lines were painfully long each day. It shouldn't be so hard to get a cup of coffee. Not a great way to start the day. But as I said, overall I really liked this hotel. I thought is was a great choice for the family for the location, the pool and the suites. We had a great stay. I really wish the hotel would fix the problems we experienced. If they would, it would have been able to give it the maximum rating (5-star) Good sized rooms, clean, comfortable beds, quiet. Friendly service, lovely view. Norma's food is excellent but the prices are too high, $100 for breakfast for two is a bit much. Portions needn't be so large. People were taking out \"doggie\" boxes. Everyone at this hotel was a wonderful host when my choir stayed there Thanksgiving week. Such a busy time, and yet I never felt rushed or mistreated. The rooms are lovely...spacious for New York...clean and very comfortable. Our room was right by the elevator, yet we never were bothered by noise. The location is terrific. It was an excellent spot for the Macy's parade. We ordered room service one afternoon and the food was delicious. We did get a good group rate as we were there with a large group. My husband and I travel to New York often and definitely plan to stay here again! We have just got back from our first visit to NY. We went to see Macy's thanksgiving parade & luckily the route had changed so we only had to walk outside to the first corner & there we were able to see everything! The hotel is in a great location for walking to the shops, central sights like the Empire state building & Rockefeller centre. About 3 minutes from Central park too! Our whole experience was great. Although we chose not to eat in the hotel, just because there are so many pubs & restaurants close by, the lobby at the hotel always was filled with people going into the burger bar, so must be good,as so popular! The rooms are a good size, very clean, comfy beds & always had HOT water!! If I had to sugguest ways to improve the hotel, it would just be to have complimentary tea & coffee making facilities in our rooms. Easier free, Internet access would have been useful too, as it does get busy in the lobby with everyone using it free in there! I would certainly recommend this hotel & definitely stay there again. Stayed here 7 nights in a very comfortable and quiet room. We found all the hotel employees to be very friendly and helpful.\\nOther than wishing for a coffee pot in the room, I give this hotel a thumbs up. Great location! Close to stores and Time Sqaure, walked around the corner on one side to Duane Reede and otherside was an organic Store that was clean and nicely priced. Only down fall was my daughter wanted to swim and you had to pay extra for the pool...so she did not swim. Large lovely , comfortable, stylish room. I called the front desk because room was warm on Thanksgiving night at 10:00pm and a maintenance man came within 10 minutes and solved the problem CHEERFULLY.\\nFrom check in to concierge assistance to check out, everyone was kind and helpful and welcoming.\\nNorma's is the BEST breakfast in the city.\\nMy only suggestions are that bathrobes, toothpaste, and q tips would be welcome in the room. Also, when the lobby is crowded, checking in can be hectic because there are no defined lines to reach the desk. Family of 7 traveling together, 4 separate rooms. Rooms were spectacular, everything you needed was there. Only issue was that the rooms were a little too warm upon arrival. Turning the thermostat off solved that. Everyone very helpful with directions for subway travel.Front desk was very polite and accomodating. Parking attendant very helpful also. Elevators are a little slower than I would have liked, but we had a great time. VERY nice. We have always booked the Meridien whenever we stay in the city, which is at least 1-2 times per year. If you could catch an e-mail special this hotel was a good value, with lots of space for our family of 3. Plus, our son, who is an avid swimmer, loves the penthouse pool. Unfortunately our most recent stay was a big disappointment. Here are the reasons why:\\n- Although a special was advertised on the website, it wasn't available for any date that I tried to book. I caved in and booked at a regular rate. I then received an email with an offer for a suite upgrade, which AGAIN was not available at all. Why offer discounts that aren't available? Extremely frustrating.\\n- The charge for a rollaway (even for a kid) is now a whopping $50 per night. When we started coming to this hotel, a rollaway in the room was free.\\n- The hotel now charges an outrageous $16/day for internet access which was included in the room charge until recently! \"Free\" access is available for 30 minutes in the lobby, if you're willing to sit on a hard bench for the duration, as the plush lobby chairs have been removed for \"renovation\". We skipped this \"option\".\\n- The hotel now charges to swim in the pool - $15 per family per day! There has always been a charge to access the gym (which is a full-blown gym, so I'm ok with that), but now we had to pay $25 extra per day just to work out in the gym and swim. What's next -- a coin lock on the bathroom?\\n- The pool is poorly managed. One section of the pool is supposed to be reserved for laps.The lap section was overrun by a gaggle of wild and screaming kids, who were busy swimming into everyone and batting each other on the head with foam noodles while their parents hang out on the sidelines drinking. When we nicely asked the lifeguard to please ask the group to move to the non-lap section, she was very hesitant and not only didn't bother to move the group, she allowed the screeching and chaos to continue. Needless to say, our experience in the pool was extremely stressful and unpleasant. If I'm going to pay $15 to swim, the pool should at least be managed appropriately. \\n- Service is mediocre at best. Housekeeping usually requires several calls, and dirty dishes stay outside rooms all day. \\nThe Meridien is still a fun hotel with large rooms in a great location. Just expect mediocre service and to be \"nickel-n-dimed\" to the tune of a few hundred dollars extra by the time your stay is over. for $500 a night, i should be able to set the room temperature to anything I want. But no. I walk in at 1am and the thermostat is set to 80 degrees. I lower it to 67, but warm air is still coming out of the unit.\\nThe front desk's response - we don't have air conditioning. Instead they tell me to turn off the thermostat and open the window. BUT the window doesn't open.\\nSO I wait for the engineer to come help. He takes forever. \\nSo now I have the EXTREMELY LOUD noises from the street cooling my room. \\nMy choices are either NOT SLEEPING because it's too loud in the room, or NOT SLEEPING because it's 80 degrees in the room.\\nDon't stay here if you want to sleep. I always enjoy my stays at LPM. They remember me at the desk every time I check in. The rooms are clean and comfortable. For NY they are even big! They have counters in the bathroom which is not all that common in NY and a must for make up etc. pedestal sinks are pretty but not to balance hair, make up etc. Nice amenities, decent room service and fun bar. The location is prime with the park, 5th avenue shopping, funky west side restaurants on 9th, walking distance to Times Square.. It's just perfect. Sad that the new building on 57th blocks many of the park views which are beautiful. Go up to the pool for some great views. I don't eat meat but people rave about the burger joint in the lobby. Norma's breakfast is decadent and huge. Plan to share. Not cheap either. Will always stay here. The Parker was great for us. We had a car to park and they had reasonable parking (no additional for valet or SUV as other hotels have. The location is great and getting in and out of the city to the hotel was super easy. It's also well located within NYC, near the park, restaurants, shopping, everything. There's an indoor pool which looked fun if we had more time. The room was very nice and comfortable and all the staff we encountered were a pleasure. Will definitely stay again. The room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel lobby is very nice. It is 3 blocks from Central Park south which was good for walking my dog. My dog was intrigued with looking at himself in the mirrors that are in the lobby. The hotel staff were wonderful and very accommodating. The only think that I didn't like was the refridgerator was not cold. However, there was an ice machine just down the hall. The neighborhood felt safe. The New York Athletic Club is right across the street and they will let guests play there. We surprised our girls (ages 5, 8, 10) for Thanksgiving with a trip to NYC~ After much debate we went with Le Parker Meridien mainly because of the location & the fact that any negative response someone posted was quickly answered by Lisa in Guest Relations. Not every hotel is going to be perfect & that goes a long way in my book. \\nPositives:\\nClose to EVERYTHING...quick (5) min walk to Central Park\\nquick 10 min walk to Times Square/The plaza/Rockefeller Center/Broadway, etc (we walked almost everywhere with my girls)\\nGuest Relations sent up Cookies the first night welcoming my girls to NYC for their first trip (big thumbs up from the girls)\\nHotel was clean, not overly crowded (although it was close to sold out), staff @ front desk was friendly,etc\\nKids loved cartoons in elevator\\nThe Pool upstairs was great. The view was one of the best in the city. You have to go to the outside area & up the stairs to really take it all in. The guy @ the pool was super nice. \\nYes, its $15 per day per family, however, my kids really enjoyed it & it gave us a nice break from the hustle bustle of the day.\\nNegatives:\\nConcierge...since we were traveling during a \"holiday\" I expected a little bit more from the Concierge desk. They did not know a lot about anything except what was right around the hotel. \\nThis to me is the biggest draw back of the hotel. Not the most friendly group of women I have dealt with on my travels. I called weeks in advance for help with Thanksgiving dinner reservations & they seemed a little put off that I was calling. I even asked for help when we arrived & it was very apparent that a \"local\" restuarant had dropped off their menu to sell to the guests. That being said, there was brown haired curly guy, that was very helpful. He sent us to Brooklyn Diner (Diner is too informal of a word for this place) for dinner. I am pretty particular & I have to say it was wonderful. Super nice staff & excellent food. The hotel needs to step up their game with Concierge especially in a place like NYC. They did not go out of the their way to help you with anything. Very disappointing...\\nHouse Keeping....Again, not the best. The room was clean, however, the first night a bag of lotion, shampoo, etc was just dropped off on our bed...not even sure why it was there. I used one of the bathrobes & never saw it again. They do not look to see what is in the sheets before sending off to be laundered. They actually took my daughters \"blankie\" with the sheets. As you can imagine the sheer panic when my 5 year old realized it was gone. We did end up finding it (thank goodness) with the help of some very helpful front desk staff. A VERY big shout out to them! We also realized this morning that another item (my little ones panda pillow pet) was sent out with the wash as well. Too late at this point~Do not leave anything in the bed...it will be lost forever....\\nSide Notes:\\nThe doorless shower drains all over the floor. The hotel really needs to look into fixing it. Nice size though...we had the JR Suite & it fit our family of (5) just perfect!\\nThe Hamburger place was fine, not the best I have ever had but certainly good. We had a better burger @ SarahBeths down the street. \\nCoffee/Bar was great. Super nice people!\\nDo not take \"bike taxi\"~total rip off, as they do not tell you the price is per person in addition to per block.\\nThe hotel does charge for everything. If you want to have your own items in the room you have to rent a seperate mini fridge which I found to be funny (we did not do it). The window does open a little bit in each of the rooms which was nice because we could not get the temp to regulate at night. There is not a coffee pot in the room which surprised me a little but there is a Starbucks on every corner, literally! \\nThe rooms are pretty quiet when the windows are closed. We brought a sound machine just in case & did not have to use it. \\nOverall it was a fine stay. I would not rate it as a \"luxury stay\" but fine all the way around. Would I stay there again, yes & would I recommend it to others, yes mainly because of the location. Le Parker Meridien was:\\n* easy to access, no queuing at reception, pleasingly a late 12 noon checkout...\\n* friendly staff\\n* a very spacious room (especially for New York City)\\n* clean, modern rooms with big beds\\n* close to Duane reade a chemist/food store for all your needs and opposite a Starbucks\\n* fabulous location for walking to 5th avenue, Central Park, Times Square\\n* a nice touch....we had an umbrella in our wardrobe just in case\\n* our room had all required amenities - bath/shower/hairdryer/plenty of electrical sockets/massive flat screen tv/great shampoo/conditioner/soap/body lotion/shower cap replaced daily/ ink pen and note pads also provided. There is a rather expensive mini bar but we chose to use the provided ice bucket and buy in our own drinks\\n* a spacious combination safe which you can fit your ipad in :) amongst other things \\n******** if you choose to stay here, please be aware that just like most other NYC hotels their can be excessive noise from hotel plumbing and outside traffic including late night bin collections.....take ear plugs to be sure of a good nights sleep ******** It's worth noting that I very seldom write a review for a hotel. I am posting this review because our stay at the Parker Meridien was throughly enjoyable. I would rate the hotel itself: rooms, staff, location as excellent and will definitely be returning to this hotel in the future. We have stayed at several hotels in NYC and Le Parker Meridien is now our favorite. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and engaging. The junior suite provides modern styling and spaciousness rarely found in a Manhattan hotel room. We are used to jam-packed rooms when staying in the city and couldn't believe a Midtown room with separate sleeping, sitting, and work areas. All the furniture and decor were modern and the room and overall hotel were very clean. The bathroom was large and had a tiled, walk-in shower. We didn't use any of the restaurant facilities because we like to explore the plethora of restaurant offerings that are within easy walking distance of this centrally-located hotel. I would highly recommend this property to anyone staying in Midtown Manhattan, and I would not hesitate to make reservations at this location again on a future trip. My wife and I just returned home from NY and we really enjoyed our stay at the Le Parker. \\nThe staff greeted us warmly, and that is worth noting in NY. Our room overlooked the park and the view was breathtaking. You really appreciate the size of Central Park with the view.\\nThe location is a block away from Central Park and Times Square. Location is excellent-period.\\nIf you are travelling with kids they can enjoy the pool. If you are travelling for business and want to get a work out in the gym is huge and full service. A very pleasant surprise.\\nWe went to Norma's for brunch on Sunday and yes it was a little pricey but the food was unreal and the vibe was NY cool. Definitely would recommend guests give it a try.\\nWhen travelling to NY keep in mind that your room is not going to be huge. This hotel has a great location, friendly staff and excellent gym, spa and pool. Ask for a room with a view of the park and enjoy.\\nAnother note is my wife and I both forgot our blackberry and I Phone chargers...nightmare. The consierge was able to charge both our phones. Amazingly generous and helpful. I stayed in a junior suite with friends which was spacious and clean. I most appreciated the early check-in which was very helpful. The pool and the view from it and the roof were also a real pleasure. The only shame was a mix up over the reservation at Normas which turned out to be no one's fault in particular just a misunderstanding but it meant I didn't get to try the famous brunch. The location is fabulous, close to so many places and fab for shopping! Le Parker Meridien is an outstanding hotel with the feel of being in a top rated condo. Friendly staff and very knowledgeable of NY. Norma the on site restaurant Sunday Bunch was worth the 1 1/2 hour wait. I will definitely be staying at this hotel on my next visit.\\nTy B Our first stay was a year ago & did not meet our expectations. The rooms were dusty & the maid service was not what I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. However, our most recent stay was a total turnaround. I would like to commend Lisa Tharp, the guest relations director. She takes guest comments seriously & takes proactive measures to make sure guests are happy with their stay. I cannot say enough about this person as we travel extensively & she clearly takes her job seriously. As for our stay, our kids enjoyed the rooftop pool & the decadent breakfast served at Norma's. I would advise ordering half of what you would normally order as the portions are quite large. The location is convenient to central park which was a treat for my two children. We will definitely return! Just stayed at Parker Meridian. Friendly staff, Excellent! onsite restaurant for breakfast at Norma's. Expensive morning coffee but Starbucks across the street. Don't forget your bathing suit to enjoy a swim with a wounderful view of the city on the 40some floor. Will be going back without a doubt. Great location; great brand; still solid value. This hotel has had its ups and downs and is now trending back up. Rooms are clean and somewhat spartan, which some of us like. Professional staff - visible when you need them, invisible when you don't. Food is good if pricey. Good location, comfortable bed, great coffee in the lounge area, great burgers at the Burger Joint.\\nHowever!! our room sevice breakfast was hardly edible... $23 eggs Benedict, $17 bowl of oatmeal. Asked about getting some last minute broadway tickets, we're told $250. Per ticket. Went upstairs and got great seats (orchestra) for $100........ (On our ipad) No in room movies, can't adjust your own ac/heat.. We come to NYC every November. Will be going back to the Hilton for the value/amenities. Check-in was a breeze and the desk staff was courteous, attentive and quick. Hotel has a bit of an older feel but rooms were still very nice. Location is great as you are in walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central Park, etc. Only had two issues: 1) several black strands of hair were hanging from the hair dryer when I entered the room which was a bit disgusting and the hot water was not working the morning I was checking out. Overall, I had a very nice experience and would stay there again.\\nMake sure you check out the top deck (on the same level as the pool). You need to sign a waiver to go out on the deck but the view is great. we arrived in new york-it was pouring so much we missed bthe hotel under our raincoats, so by the time we reached we where soaking, even the clothing in the suitcase, all wet...\\nthe receptionist gave us a room right away, it was about 11am.we were happy to take ahot shower.\\nsome of the staff were too cool, barely looking up from the computer, not helpfull as I had difficulties with the bordingpass printing, they just told me to try at another plasce in the 3rd floor.for a 4 star at the rate of 300 $ I definitely expect more service.\\nthe rooms are rundown, mold in one corner of the bathroom.not possible to open the windows, you need to call someone to open them for you and close them again.the room smells of cheap airfreshener.the rooms are big but anonymous.\\ncarlos at the reception was very nice and went out of the way to make things happen, thank you carlos it made all the difference.location is good..I do not recomend the palce and would not stay there again. Recently stayed at this hotel in NYC. For New York, the room was quite big, but quite uncomfy for 3 people. My wife and 16 year old ook the King size bed, and I was relegated to the roll away (which they normally charge $50/night for). Terrible sleep the first night. My wife and kid left the next day (to go back home), so the second night was quite comfy.\\nThe hamburgers were amazing - always a large line-up.\\nThe staff are very friendly.\\nMy pet peeve was that the sink and the tub always got clogged up. Figured the Housekeeping staff would notice and get it fixed, but they didn't bother.\\nThe location is amazing - there is a 24 hour food market right next door. I think I will make this hotel my \"regular\" when visiting NYC. Just hope they do something about the plumbing.......... The room HVAC didn't work, and it seemingly could not be repaired. The bathroom and room were nominally clean with dust on the broken clock and hair in the shower. The \"top rated\" fitness center has dated equipment that is noticeable to any avid fitness enthusiast even through the disguise of the renovated walls and ceilings. The staff are surly with but two exceptions: Mohammed, the bellman, and Alex, of Knave. Friendly front desk services and helpful. The room decor is contemporary and I love the swivel TV panel partition which you can watch TV either from sitting area or bedroom sides. Great locations and 1 min walk to 24hrs drug store which carries lots of necessities. Solid hotel experience. We needed a place to stay after hurricane Sandy. We had been out of power for 10 days and were uncomfortable imposing on friends any longer. We decided to take a little mini-vacation and Le Parker Meridian had rooms available. Good service, friendly staff. Junior suite was nicely set up. Good location. I would definitely recommend it. It took our minds off the problems at home. It's really all about location and since it's perfect there's no reason to write more about that.\\nWe booked a parkview room and got a room at 23. floor. Sure, we could see the park in between the buildings in front of us. But with a building covering 98 percent of the view we felt obliged to kindly ask for a better view. The room was otherwise really nice. And... \"sure, of course, no problem, will 39. floor be nice ?\" Great service at the desk! And great view !\\nWe also enjoyed the casual atmosphere and small amount of twisted humour here and there. (Please don't use the minibar as a fridge. If you need a fridge, please let us know and we will be happy to provide you one :) \\nSomewhat strange though, to find absolutely no information about the facilities in the hotel. But the concierge could tell us everything.\\nI must mention the bed, which was just fantastic !\\nMany reasons to stay here, but I'm not to sure about coming back. I expected a little better value and missed a sort of \"soul\" you can find at many other hotels. The building itself is probably most to blame in that matter, but the staff is doing a great job trying to compensate. \\nBut of course, if you like to sleep well in a spacious clean room (with a view) within walking distance of everything, don't look any further ! We stayed at Le Parker Meridien one weekend in October in a junior suite. \\nThe positives:\\n-GREAT location close to Central Park. \\n-huge room, sitting area, amazing bathroom.with incredible space, great products\\n-staff friendly & helpful.\\n-price for value (we paid $310 per night)\\n-upgrading to a junior suite puts you on the highest floors with a decent view.\\n-great little burger restaurant in house. You can call from the room and order your food and skip the long line trailing through the lobby. Very easy fast food you can bring back to your room. \\n-Starbucks right across the street with free wi fi\\n-UNBELIEVABLE pool on the 42nd floor overlooking Central Park. You pay extra for the pool use but it's so worth it. views of city and park outside on roof. Grab a chaise and lay in the sun. It's free and one of the best things you'll do. \\nThe negatives\\n-no coffee maker in room/free coffee in the lobby\\n-lobby is rather small and loud\\n-parking will kill you. Google \"central parking coupon\" and you can get a coupon and save about 40% off parking. We paid $40 per 24 hours rather than $65.00\\n-no free wi \\n-restaurant is expensive. \\n-you can't easily find coffee until 6:30 am on the weekends. Gesh!\\n-you pay to work out at the fitness center & swim. Really??? Really???? Good service and nice sized rooms and bathroom. We stayed partly because it was recommended to us by a friend and because of its midtown location. It has a pool but you have to pay extra to use it as you do with wifi which was a bit annoying seeing as we had paid a lot of money to stay there. The hotel has a burger joint attached to it which is pretty good, people queue night and day for it.. Norma's is supposed to be good for breakfast and lunch too. \\nEverything you need is in the room, iron, umbrella, flat screen tv etc but do not remove anything from the minibar unless you want it because it automatically is added to your bill even if you replace it. Take your own hair dryer though if you have long hair because the small one provided isn't very powerful. \\nThe staff were helpful until we were evacuated during hurricane Sandy due to the collapsed crane opposite, when they handled the situation really badly.. Rooftop pool on a clear day cannot be beat. Jr. Suites are great for small families. Have stayed here many times over the years and hotel was pretty cool when we first visited. Elevators always seem slow. Maybe they should put cartoon tvs on each floor to watch while waiting for the elevator vs. having them in the elevator cars. I have stayed here several times and LOVE the location... but each time I come back I am reminded that this hotel does not live up to its promise or potential. This visit, the heat in my room did not work - on the second maintenance visit to fix it, the maintenance man told me 'this is a problem with a lot of rooms, I'll just bring you a space heater.' So I spent the week getting up every few hours to turn the space heater on/off. I think consistent, dependable heat should be a basic requirement in a $450/night hotel room. Having stayed at the Meridien Parker from Oct 26th to Oct 29th 2012, I can say that the hotel operated with supreme poise and effectiveness in the lead up to Hurricane Sandy. The staff couldn't have been more professional, considerate, helpful and friendly if they tried. Even though we faced mandatory evacuation on Oct 29th, as the crane attached to the highrise next to the hotel collapsed, we received detailed updates on a regular basis regarding the expected time frame for re-entry to the premises. And even when it was deemed too dangerous to re-open the hotel, the staff went the extra mile to ensure that everyone's belongings could be collected in a safe and timely manner.\\nWhile the storm made the experience somewhat uncomfortable, we would stay at the Meridien Parker again in a heartbeat. Some rooms need updating and brightening up, Although I was there at the end of October, air con needs improving. My room was either cold or stuffy.\\nThe location was terrific and the hotel's customer service was even better. Spacious, amenities good, no coffee in room. Went to shows, shopping down 5th Ave and as far as Macy's, went to M&M Store, Victoria's Secret and everything in between. Ate on East River side down near Wall Street area - South Street pier very 'user friendly' with lots of shopping and eats. Also got to Central Park - walked everywhere except to Statue of Liberty. The subway is very usable, though obviously Hurricane Sandy has since taken its toll. Checked online and as SPG member got a 'pay ahead and save' rate - which was quite helpful. Skipped museums, but saw so much of the city. Very comfortable for our family of 3. My family and I stayed at the end of October. We liked our room. We found it clean and well organized. We also enjoyed the location. My only constructive criticism would be that we partly chose the hotel because the pool. Upon entering the pool room we were informed that it would cost us extra to use it. This was not made clear at booking and was slightly disappointing. We were not going to inform our 7 year old son dressed in his bathing suite that the pool wasn't going to happen. Aside from this our stay was comfortable and we would probably go back. Stayed here several times. This is a very nice hotel, with clean ande very spacious rooms (by New York standards). All mod cons in the room, including DVD player. Lovely and clean batrooms with great showers.\\nBeds are very nice and you will most definitely get a good nights sleep.\\nGreat swimming pool on the rooftop as well. \\nJust one street from Central Park and the Subway. Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops close-by. Highly recomended! Stayed mid-October for four nights on a package trip with Thomas Cook. Great location for Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Museum Mile, Times Square and lots more of the city's attractions. Service was couteous and efficient, rooms and bathroom clean, and very comfortable beds. Power showers and plumbing also very good. We'd asked for a quiet room, and our certainly was, very little street noise on 22nd floor. However, air con was noisy, so take ear-plugs! Breakfast at Norma's expensive so we didn't sample it. The burger joint behind the curtain in the lobby was constantly busy and was highly rated by a friend. Would happily use this hotel again for a city break/short stay. I go to NY for business a few times a year and office is around the corner so Le Parker was walking distance but what a mistake:\\n- 600 dollars per night was standard rate for a room which is expensive and one expects top service, but here we go:\\n- every morning there was a 20-40 min wait to get a table for breakfast (and the breakfast is very expensive btw). The few days I decided to wait I would say more than 1/3rd of hotel guests opted not to wait but to leave the hotel just to get breakfast. I had to turn to room service instead which has very few options;\\n- i tried to use the laundry service. just dial 53 the laundry form says, which i did for 2 days - no one picks up. There are no instructions on how to drop laundry off (apart from dialling 53) so i hung the hotel laundry bag with completed form on my door handle in the morning, only to find the same bag on my sofa when i returned, still dirty;\\n- I had to stay a few days longer (so you can imagine my hotel bill @ $600 per night at this stage) and run out of toothpaste one night. I ask in reception if they hand out these small travel portions but just get pointed to the pharmacy around the corner...\\n- Since I had no USD on me I go to the hotels cash machine, which charges $ 4 extra per withdrawal; \\n- Felt thirsty when i came back and took a small bottle of still water from the minibar....charged to me at $6.53, just plain robbery; \\nThere is just no reason to stay at a place which doesnt appreciate your custom and tries to rip you off every way you turn. Last time for me - there are so many better places in NY.\\nSoren Fantastic location and staff very helpful. Our room was on the 22nd floor and had a great city view. Had a problem with our bathroom sink, reported it to reception in the morning and by the afternoon it had been fixed. It had been years since I stay at Le Parker Meridien because my annual conference chooses the hotel. This year I returned because of a bad experience at the conference hotel last year and I needed a change. So glad I did. The location is perfect for a quick jog in Central Park or a short walk to Times Square or shopping on Fifth Ave. The Burger Joint is great for that late night munchies and the brunch at Norma's was delightfully different and fulfilling. The staff was very helpful and friendly without being pretentious. The location is just enough off the park that the businesses near by are much more afforadable and it is easy to keep on budget. Recently stayed here for a quick business trip to the city. Pleasantly surprised to get this hotel/location for the price (much lower than comparable hotels in the area and below our corporate cap). Attentive service all around - everyone from doorman to front desk to baggage storage was very nice. Good room size for NYC/Starwood property. Clean with comfortable bed, updated (or looked that way) furnishings. Top notch bathroom amenities (Roth). Beautiful bar off of lobby - typical NYC price for drink but came with nice selection/quantity of snacks. Had heard about Burger place in lobby - ran in there for quick lunch - was quite a scene and good burger! We ate fairly early (12:30 - 1) and line was huge when we left. Location is great - easy walk to stores, work, park. So far, I think this is one of the best hotels in the city, modern and classy lobby, I got a nice room and good service. \\nAnother point is Burger place, located on ground floor... Very convenient.\\nThis place is just south of central park (3blocks-big bonus) and easily walkable to times square, and had several subway lines minutes away. Definitely consider if its in your budget! Amazing mid town location next to lots of subways so super easy to get everywhere. \\nCan imagine in the 90s this was a crazy luxury hotel but seems a bit dated now. \\nNO TEA & COFFEE FACILITIES IN THIS HOTEL, which is totally crazy considering it is supposed to be a top hotel, but maybe that's cos I'm a Brit... \\n$10 fee per day to use the gym facilities, but brilliant classes.\\nCharges for putting any item in the fridge. \\nCleaning not so great... \\nGenerally good but not amazing. Close to everything you want in New York. The room was large, very clean and comfortable. Skip the burger downstairs and go to 5 Guys down the block. Staff was attentive and quick to take care of a leak. They arrived as soon as we departed the room and everything was cleaned up by the time we returned. If you're visiting to do the \"tourist thing,\" this is your perfect home base. Spectacular location in Manhattan near 5th Avenue shopping and MOMA. Very comfortable, large (for NYC) rooms and beds. Breakfast at Norma's is truly special. Excellent subway access and rather easy to find cabs. A great hotel in the great location: One minute walk to the Carnegie Hall and five minutes walk to MOMA, or to the Central Park. And ten minutes walk to the Lincoln Center.\\nThe service is Excellent and the bed is comfortable. Dream-like breakfast and a very quiet, beautiful bar which serves delicious cappucino. This is a perfect hotel for who travels solo, and for a couple. I stayed very often in this hotel. I like the view from the rooms to the central park, the comics in the elevators is a great idea. the service is very friendly, so its great to stay here for business or holidays The Le Parker Meridien in my opinion is the best Starwood property in NYC. That includes the St. Regis. Yes the St Regis is nice and has a great address, but I've found it a bit too over the top and you really don't get the value when you compare what you get to what you pay. The LPM is a luxury hotel in every respect. The lobby is simple but grand. The service is excellent. The rooms may seem a bit dated until you realize the theme in the Mad Men era. Clean lines, and simple. The location of the hotel is set away from the frenzy of Time Square and just two blocks from Central Park. Within a few minutes walk, you can be in Central Park or the heart of 5th Avenue shopping, or surrounded by the lights of Time Square. The hotel gym is ridiculous. You can't call it a hotel gym because it puts most sports clubs/gyms to shame. There's also a hidden little gem tucked away in the lobby that serves one of the best burgers in NYC. The Burger Joint is nothing you'd expect when you stand in the pristine lobby. Walk in and you're transported into a neighborhood greasy spoon that serves the perfect burger. A must try even if you're not staying at the hotel. A rock solid upscale hotel with wonderful staff. The room was large, clean and perfectly functional, albeit lacking any particular charm. An excellent bed and huge TV. Better for business trips than couples (we were a couple). Brunch at Norma's was insanely good. The staff, the location, the lobby, the random burger joint in the lobby, Norma's!!! \\nI didn't give it 5 stars because the view from the rooms say \"park view\" but my view was actually of a newly constructed building thats 30 feet from the hotel. So for the most part I had my shades drawn. As stated by others, the rooms are just average as far as furnishings. Felt spacious. The bed was a comfortable firm. The hotel has 2 street entrances on 56th and 57th. The lobby is very nice. I kept hearing about their famously delicious hamburgers, but did not have time to try them myself. Located on same block as Carnegie Hall. Just a few short blocks from Central Park. This hotel is easy to miss as their signage is not very prominent and faces sideways. location, location, location,....You can walk to Central Park and Broadway, shopping on 5th, and great restaurants on upper West side......it's midtown west on 56th- between 6 and 7th. rooms were average size....comfortable, bath was small but sufficient. Bar is great, also good good for coffee in am....Dry Bar for hair style blow outs is a plus Stayed last week as part of our trip to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary.\\nThe hotel has a great location with fantastic views to Central Park.\\nThe staff went above and beyond their responsibilities to make sure we had a pleasant stay.\\nWill definitely stay again. Great location. Excellent service all around. Room were very chic and well planned out. Larger than most rooms we've stayed at in New York. A bit on the pricey side for what you are getting (the main reason I didn't give it all 5 stars) but overall worth it. Rooms were clean but need a little more minor upkeep. At this price point throwing in some mini bar items would go a long way to making people very happy at very minimal expense to the hotel. If you are planning an NYC get away, are sick of the Times Square hotels, and are ready for an upgrade, I think you'll be pleased by Le Parker Meridien. We would definitely stay here again. Ideally located just a short walk to Central Park , shopping, and several restaurants. The lobby is elegant and front desk staff, Carlos, was very helpful. The room service was good especially breakfast menu from Norma ( supposed to be one of the best breakfast in NYC). However, I was less than impressed with the room. While it was fairly spacious, certain area reminds me that this is not up to par with Westin, Marriott. I haven't seen a room that use cheap looking curtain and aluminum rod in lieu of wooden door for the closet area even at lower end hotel such as Fairfield Inn. If I chose to stay with a non park view room with starpick rate of $250, it prob OK. But for the usual price near $400 / night it certainly not worth it. I actually chose park view starpick rate of $300 which is not too bad considering the location. But other than the room, everything else was good. The view of Central Park from 32 floor was not that great with a lot of building blocking part of the view and not worth the extra $50. If you can get near the 50th floor it might worth it. Burger joint in the lobby has a very long line but as a guest you can order it without waiting in line. I tried a Thai restaurant near by, Topaz, and found the food to be substandard. Morimoto restaurant , 5 miles away, was worth the $10 taxi fare with excellent appetizer and entree from iron chef. Just stayed for three nights. Great location, rooms are well-appointed - but what makes this hotel excellent is its staff. The concierge on this visit found just the right restaurant for me and a friend who had recently gone through a divorce. We needed something lively with a good scene to remind my buddy of the possibility of good times ahead -- but not so loud or tables so close together that we couldn't talk. The concierge delivered with just the right steakhouse within walking distance on a busy Saturday night. \\nBut more importantly, when I stayed there a few years ago and had a kidney stone -- their reference to a great concierge doctor who made a hotel call to my room to see me -- saved me a trip to the ER! (Still painful, but his diagnosis saved me the drama of a strange emergency room.) Far better hotels in New York at half the cost - try Distrikt Hotel on 40th Street. If it wasn't for switching hotels mid-stay then my special trip to New York would have been a disaster!! Wi-fi at 25 dollars a night!!!!!!!!! I won't take up a lot of space repeating what others have already said. The location is good, the lobby is beautiful and staff really try to be friendly and helpful, but the rooms are really basic. Not much better then Motel 6. \\nIf you are not going to spend a lot of time in the lobby, try to get a better room somewhere.\\nWe didn't use the restaurants or bar. I don't see the need to spend $30++ on breakfast when there a lot of great places nearby for less the $10.\\nThe first room we were put in did not have a working phone or mini bar fridge. The second was ok and larger, but there really no views. Generally it's quite.\\nNewspapers are available at no charge from the concierge.\\nAnd why should you pay to use the gym and $16 for in room Internet. I know it's New York but they are really taking advantage of their patrons. My wife and I checked in to the Le Parker Meridian for a 4 night stay that was a mix of work and play in New York City. We like the area and its proximity from a business standpoint as it is close to most of the meetings I needed to attend, but it is also great for people that want to access the great shopping on 5th/Madison Ave, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Carnegie and Central Park. We like the fact that there are are entrances on both 56th and 57th St as that makes getting to the hotel from different areas very easy and convenient. The hotel is clean and nice but the rooms are somewhat small with very little drawer space and the bathroom is literally a closet. It is not realistic for two people to be in the bathroom at the same time. As for prices I think they are reasonable for what you would expect in New York City. The only disappointment is the $10 charge to use the gym. While it is nice, it is the first Starwood property that I have had to pay to use the gym as a gold member. The umbrella in our closet came in handy as it rained heavily one day of our trip. If you are basing your choice on location I think this is a great hotel. If you are looking for luxury I would look elsewhere. We didn't spend much time in the room so based on location it was great for us. Would look around next time in New York City but would be open to staying here again. This was my third stay, and while I wouldn't have thought it possible, Le Parker Meridien keeps getting better. The rooms, location, and rooftop pool are all wonderful, but it's the staff--and I mean every single hotel employee I've met--who make this hotel a truly joyful place. Everyone is friendly, helpful and professional. That's what makes Le Parker the only place I'll stay in NYC. My fiancee and i stayed here recently and were not disappointed. The staff were courteous and friendly and extremely helpful and obliging. The room was light,airey and clean, the bed was so comfortable i was sleeping ten hour nights! And the pillows too...so soft. There was also a big screen tv on the wall if you got the chance to watch it as there is so much to do in NYC! The view of Central Park was amazing and it was quiet up on the 22nd floor too. One minor detail, the room couldve done with some darker curtains as the room got light fairly early in the morning without them plus be aware of a small charge for using the pool and gym too, only 7/8 dollars per person each time. The location is great, right on the doorstep is Central Park and numerous bars and restaurants plus its a short walk to The Empire State Building and Times Square. Just returned from staying in Le Parker Meridien while on a girl's break to NY. The hotel was great in every way; lovely spacious room tastefully and thoughtfully designed and decorated, very friendly service, classy bar, good food and great location. The roof -top pool was amazing! A fab hotel in every way. very good location .nice modern well managed hotel .\\nrooms facing the park have excellent view.\\nexcellent reservation and check in.\\ninspite of late night we had a smiling and helpfull staff at check in.\\nspecial thanks to sophia and mona....\\nnice restaurant at lobby with special breakfast menu and smiling staff We were back at the Parker Meridien for our annual Anniversary trip to New York and had another wonderful experience. Great location, great staff and great rooms (with new televisions)! We'll be back, again and again. What a terrific time in New York City! I travelled with my two sisters and three nieces. We stayed at Le Parker Meridien on 56th St. What a terrific hotel. The rooms were great, the beds truly are stupidly comfortable and the front desk staff and concierge were great. \\nBe sure to go to the Burger Shack behind the curtain in the lobby. The burgers are awesome!!!\\nWe enjoyed coffee and wine in the bar. It is a lovely atmosphere, but $18.00 for an okay glass of wine seemed a little steep, but hey it is NYC.\\nI would strongly recommend this hotel and a trip to New York City for everyone. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to be amazed at the lovely, helpful people in the city!!! Loved the location of this hotel to Times Square, 5th Ave, and Central Park.\\nHotel rooms are showing signs of wear but we liked the dining options within the hotel\\nand the value of the Junior Suite vs. other hotels in the city for a room the same size. A half block from the subway, two blocks from Central park, 5 short blocks from Times Square.....I cant think of a better location to get to do all the things we have learned to love about New York\\nThe Hotel being an SPG lodging means a lot for us as I just used points to upgrade to a wonderful view of Central Park. The people inside make the stay enjoyable and the Burger Joint gives a person hunger pains the minute we walked in for check in\\nWe will stay here again soon This hotel is dated and showing signs of wear, decent, but not special in any way. It is busy, the staff is decent and attempt to be helpful, but it is not a good experience It may be that they are not able to shine given the chaos in the lobby, there is not enough staff. There are so many great hotels in NYC in this price range I would suggest staying somewhere else. If you do end up here you should read below.\\nDo not stay in a lower room facing 56th street. The garbage trucks apparently begin working between 10pm and 11pm to clean up the streets. The noise was so bad i called up and requested another room. I was on the 8th floor, if you want a decent nights sleep avoid at all costs a room facing 57th on a lower floor. My reservation was originally for the \"Tower\" they said that they upgraded me into a larger room, which they did. But if you enjoy sleeping don't get duped by the upgrade, stay in a smaller room in the tower. It is quieter. I was much happier in the smaller tower room. I reently completed another excellent stay at the Parker Meridien hotel. I have been staying 3-4 times per year at this hotel for the past seven years.\\nThe hotel is well-run and maintained. It is located in an excellent mid-town location near Central Park and Rockefeller Center. Driving to this hotel from points north of NYC is also very easy and you get the big benefit of avoiding the messy and crowded I-95 and the various East River tunnels and bridges. Simply take the Hutchinson River Pkwy to the Cross County Pkwy. At end of Cross County, take the Saw Mill Pkwy Southbound which becomes the Henry Hudson Pkwy. Pass under the George Washington Bridge. When Henry Hudson Pkwy ends at 60th Street, Simply make left turn at the 56th street traffic light and travel straight until you reach 6th Avenue. You then pull up in front of the hotel.\\nAs a Lifetime SPG Platinum member, I was well treated and provided as usual with a Junior Suite upgrade. Room size is good for a Jr. Suite and everything was clean. The valet parking ($52/day) is easy and efficient. Overall, the Parker is a very nice and well-run hotel in a prime location in Manhattan. In terms of location for visiting the top museums, Central Park and upscale shopping areas, this hotel is hard to beat! I already look forward to my next stay! Excellent service and the spacious rooms made my stay at Le Parker Meridien memorable. There were a few ways in which the hotel could be improved e.g a second turning down of beds in the evening if they had been used in the afternoon. Other than that, the staff were wonderful and the waiter delivering my morning coffee made a happy start to my day. Room service was also very quick. We had a wonderful stay at the Le Parker Meridien. From our arrival when the bellman who was very busy made sure to tell me how to get to reception and follow with our bags a few minutes later when he was able to get the group e was helping taken care of. The front desk staff was also very nice. We were upgraded to a deluxe room and it was huge, not only by NY standards, but any city. Bathroom was tiny and lighting not great, but other than that it was a nice room. Towels were newer, soft and fluffy, amenities were good. What really stood out was the concierge staff. I have been to New York 8-10 times before, and have family that lives in the city, but always check to see what is recommended. They definitely steered us perfectly! I appreciated that when we asked about going for a drink or a place for lunch they took time to ask a few questions to see what we would be interested in, and gave very thoughtful suggestions. We had our 3 year old daughter with us and everyone also made an appropriate fuss over her. It was a nice grown up hotel where she felt very comfortable. Definitely on our return list!\\nI was also surprised at how quiet the rooms were, especially considering we were on a lower level. We have stayed at the Soho Grand, St. Regis, Helmsley Park Lane and other places in NYC, but for the price this was a great value. This is a superb location! The Parker Meridien offers a fair value for the price. It provides stylish, yet comfortable hotel surroundings. The restaurant is fantastic - great scene and decor. I first stayed at this hotel in 1991, and we will absolutely stay at the Parker Meridien again when we are in New York! My partner and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 7 nights at the end of September. First impressions of the hotel were great, the entrance lobby being very grand with modern art on the walls. The service at check in was excellent and friendly, however there was no offer of help with our 5 cases to our room. We stayed in a park view room on the 37th floor, and the room was fantastic. The view over central park was stunning, we didn't close the curtains for the entire week such was view both day and night. The room had a huge TV on the wall with lots of channels which was good for entertainment whilst we rested after a long day and before going out for dinner. Location-wise, the hotel is very central for all tourist related places and there are lots of good restaurants very close to the hotel. We tried the Burger Joint (the queue was around 20 minutes) and although it was good, it wasn't amazing, perhaps I had high expectations after reading so many good reviews. The barbers shop was a nice touch and I had a old fashioned wet shave which was well worth the $40 I paid. All in all, we had a lovely time in NY and the hotel was a great base to see the city and comfortably relax in. Well recommended. We stayed in a nice very large room with fabulous views of Central Park (for those with a room on the other side or lower down the view is also to be had from the top floor where the pool is, as well as a great 360° terrace). The location is obviously terrific - a couple of blocks from the Park, close to shopping and theaters, lots of public transportation nearby. Service was very attentive (and had to be because a number of things you would normally expect were missing from our room when we checked in). The breakfast place on the ground floor (\"Norma's\") is great; very crowded on weekends (make a reservation!). Minor criticisms: the furniture could do with an upgrade and the airconditioning controls were not working properly (we wound up putting newspapers over the vents to keep from freezing). We and our friends had a great birthday weekend at Le Parker Meridien. The hotel was a perfect location to travel from to all our outings. The service at the hotel was excellent, giving us tips and directions on where to go. We had a great New York experience. Let me start by saying that I am a well travelled individual and have stayed in some beautiful hotels around the globe therefore I think my thoughts/opinions count.\\nThis wasn't my first choice of hotel for my recent trip and it was with some trepidation that I agreed to stay here.\\nOn arrival I was upgraded to a junior suite which was a nice touch - checking in process was acceptable. \\nThe general feel of the hotel is \"Tatty\" - the lift interior is scratched and bruised and the corridor leading to my room was littered with used food trays and wine glasses. Most of the hotel room doors had seen better days.\\nWine glasses remained on the corridor floor for a 24 hour duration.\\nEntering my room took me back to a 1960's bedsit. The artex ceilings had seen better days and in places the paint had been renewed creating varying shades of white. The net curtains had a yellowish hue to them and were certainly in need of a good wash. \\nThe air vents were clogged with fluff and dust and the 1960's wooden interior had seen better days. The primitive double glazed windows had collected a lot of grime over the years and there was an array of dead moths/insects in the room which bewildering had not been cleaned up.\\nBreakfast 15 minute wait so went to a nice place on the corner - Rue 57.\\nThe rate charged was well in excess of USD 500 (room only), and yet I was still charged USD 15.00 a day for wifi and USD 10.00 to use the Gym. In addition to this when I requested to use a computer/printer to arrange the boarding pass for my flight I was to find out that this would incur further charges.\\nThis hotel is tired, dirty and behind the times - believe me, for the money they charge you can do a lot better in Manhattan. AVOID. Great property .. great location ... the Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridien,just off the Lobby, is Killer !!! When you see 30 people standing in line to get a Cheeseburger and Fries ... it's GOOOD !!! So easy to get to anything in NYC from Le Parker Meridien ... location, location, location We stayed two nights over a weekend in early October 2012. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous, from the unloading of luggage at the curb to check-in, to ensuring that we had enough pillows, to answering questions about taxis, subway stations, and tourist attractions. Likewise the service and menu at Norma's Restaurant within the hotel was first class. You felt every inch that you were staying at one of the finest of New York City hotels. I would certainly stay there again! Stayed 4 nights for a birthday weekend in NYC. Chose this hotel because of its location. However, Darius made our stay amazing. It's hard to find people who care in NYC, and he is someone who definitely makes a difference. We checked into the Parker Meridian after traveling for 6 days. We had a reservation for 5 nights. The first thing I wanted to do is unpack my suitcases but unfortunately there wasn't a dresser in the room and the closet was very small. If this is a one night stay go for it. The location is great and the staff is very nice but the room takes minimalism to a new level. Fortunately, the manager who was extremely accommodating upgraded us to a Jr. Suite which had a built in armoire that was more than adequate. The room is a good size and can more than accommodate a dresser and larger nightstands, hopefully it's in the plan. Stayed 7 nights on 40th floor with a Park View. Super friendly, yet completely professional Front Desk staff. Not overbearing valet/bell people. Quickly developed a daily routine: a) up at dawn to enjoy the Park; b) Breakfast at off-the-lobby Norma's (but get there first thing; beware mega-sized portions); c) run around for business and/or fun all day; d) Cappuccino at off-the-lobby Knave Cafe; d) different top quality restaurant each night all within walking distance with concierge recommendations being spot on; and e) collapse into supremely comfortable bed so as to rest up and do it all over again next day! I recently spent two days at the Parker on business. A few quick notes:\\n1. It has a great mid-town location (though so do a number of other hotels).\\n2. The room was fine, clean and comfortable. \\n3. The small bar area is a nice place to have a drink if you can manage to swing one of the seats.\\nNo real negatives, just nothing particularly special about the hotel to set it apart. Its actually somewhat colorless - though in fairness, a Monday-Wednesday stay isn't exactly the time of the week most hotels show their charm. \\nSo, depending on what type of pricing you can get, it may be a perfect place for you to stay on your trip.. I am very fond of the Parker Meridien. When I lived in NY I belonged to the gym and walked through it weekly. When I moved away, we stayed there and my kids loved the cartoons in the elevator. And it is still a well run and charming hotel, with a couple of glitches. The rooms (or at least my room) had no way to change the temperature. Instead there is a note to call the desk if you want it changed and an engineer will be dispatched. Not helpful if you wake up at 3 am too hot and are trying to get back to sleep. Second, I didn't see a place to get coffee and run - the only choice was Norma, which was slow and very expensive, albeit quite good. But I don't really need a pound of lox on my bagel :) Otherwise, it remains a fun hotel for business or family travel. Hotel was far more modern than I expected, staff fantastic - funky little lounge and we loved the burger bar. Above all, clean and comfortable, and great location. My friends and I agreed that we would stay here again...because we never even got to the pool! Le Parker Meridien is a great place to stay. We were able to get a discounted price for this place. The service was fabulous and friendly. The room was big enough and the beds comfy! My daughter and I were in New York to celebrate our birthdays and the Meridien was the perfect spot to do so. It is close to everything. The doormen and staff provided a safe environment. Plus, Central Park and the Carnegie Deli are a short walk away! The hotel is very conveniently located for a business trip to New York City. The staff is attentive and the hotel offers a number of on-site venues that are great if you don't want/don't need to leave the premises - ie. great restaurants, new gym. My only compliant is that the rooms are a bit on the older side compared to other hotels in the area and the bathrooms are quite small. I will NEVER again stay at this hotel. The front desk service was horible. It was my husban't bday so I booked 3 rooms for us and our guests. When I arrived late at night the hotel wanted to charge me for 4 rooms claiming I had a no show. All of my guests showed up, but I only reserved 3 rooms! The night manager \"Mona Salh\" was exremly rude and was notin anyway trying to resolve the situation. The rooms are note worth $600/night, they didn't even leave shampoo/conditioner each day and had to call and request them each day we were there! I'd rather stay at the 4 seasons or St. Regis where I know what I am getting. The hotel doesn't have a business room just a small kiosk which is a nightmare as well! Never again! This hotel is in a great spot. It is within walking distance of Central Park and Times Square. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go. The subway was only a block away. \\nThe line was long at check-in but because of that the staff sent up a fruit tray for us to enjoy later. \\nThe room was very nice and had a nice view. \\nWould certainly stay here again. I will give the Parker Meridien one more chance. I stay in hotels about half the year. When I'm in NY I usually stay at a W, but thought I'd try the PM again. \\nThe things I liked about the PM include the location and the design of the rooms. The staff is also very good, and I appreciate the high level of service. However, on this trip, there were a MILLION little irritating things broken / wrong:\\n- I wanted to see about pre-ordering an early breakfast because my husband had a very early flight the next morning. I picked up the room svc menu but a child (apparently) had scrawled all over it with a pen.\\n- I got on the phone to call room service. No one picked up the phone. After 2-3 minutes, I hung up. \\n- I started to get into bed and thought \"I'll just call from the bedroom phone\" (we were in Rm 1718, a Jr. Suite) but it was broken. So much for room service.\\n- The next morning, I needed to iron a shirt. Someone (same child?) had scrawled all over the ironing board with a pen or magic marker.\\n- The safe wouldn't close, so it blocks the door unless you lock it.\\n- It was raining, so I grabbed an umbrella and started walking across town with it. The handle fell off.\\n- The sink in the bathroom was clogged -- the water barely drains out.\\n- The AC in the rooms was either on full-blast or not at all, so we got to choose to freeze or sweat.\\nSo, would I stay there again, or recommend it to a friend? Maybe. I'll probably give the Parker Meridien hotel one more chance, but if things don't improve, I'll choose a different option. I have been to NYC many times and have my favorites uptown but needed to stay in Midtown this time for a quick 24 hour stay and was looking for a reliable, somewhat luxurious hotel for a competitive price. I ended up staying at the Parker Meridien and loved it! It is in a perfect location. I never needed a cab after I arrived and was able to walk to everything. I was upgraded to a deluxe room and it was very large - tons of space. The room was very clean and the bath amenities great. I was a little surprised that in such a large NYC hotel there wasn't some sort of security at the elevators (security or key card). Ate breakfast at Norma's in the hotel and it was fantastic. Will definitely stay here again! Smart hotel in a great location close to Central Park, diners and Empire State, Times Square etc.\\nGreat view from pool but £10 to use. Popular restaurant although we chose to eat out. Would recommend. This was undoubtedly my most pleasant experience in New York. A short trip to the city was not long enough to appreciate the outstanding location, service and amenities at this hotel. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Perfect location to use as your base, close to all great shopping spots and sightseeing (2 blocks from Central Park). Park views from the hotel are stunning. I would recommend a Park View room. The Dry Bar downstairs was such a treat with great service and outstanding work - not badly priced at all! The Burger Joint lived up to it's reputation, with an awesome cheese burger - I was able to bypass the long line and call in the order from my room. All in all, a great stay. I will definitely be staying here again! My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The rooms were much larger than expected and were clean and modern looking. Very comfortable beds- we slept great! Good location near Central Park. The staff was friendly and helpful...we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others. One night stay, I am a premier member of whatever the club is called - SPG? In any event, in business for one night. I always ask for a \"quiet\" room, which is always tough in Manhattan. They put me on the 5th floor, which turned out horrible because you re close to the street. I was too tired to change rooms or even ask. But seriously, when someone asks for a quiet room you are put on the 5th floor? I think this hotel is 42 stories. So I was able to hear the trash trucks on 56th street. Good times, and I just blasted the air conditioner to drown out the NYC garbage trucks, although it was not enough to drown out the occassional motorcycle noise.\\nThe room itself was decent, and the walk-in shower was a smart design. I had what they called a mini-suite or junior suite, which is usually what I get.\\nCheckout process was awkward; you would think they would stuff the invoice under your door or permit online check out. But nope, these folks are stuck in a process that is old and slow; you have to wait in line and make it \"official\". What a complete waste of time for everyone...\\nIn any event, two stars for these people, as they likely too advantage of the knowledge I was only in town for one night. Stayed here the weekend of Sept 20th to 23rd. Had a great stay. Staff was always very pleasant and willing to help. The location of the hotel was very well situated. We were within walking distance of everything. the staff was fantastic - from the doorman upon our arrival to the front desk at check-in and housekeeping at the end of the night. Our room was perfect - clean and a good size. The location is perfect. We were lucky with a good deal at somewhere we wouldn't normally afford. We really enjoyed our stay. A cool burger joint, the beautiful bar/cafe and great pool, though u need to pay extra for it. Staff generally friendly. We like it as it was beautiful but not stuffy. Room was a good size with a great view. A fine hotel with great views on the park side. Wonderful view terrace above the penthouse that somehow goes unmentioned on the website---was a highlight of our stay!\\nDid not like the fact that you have to call the engineering staff to adjust your room thermostat--the guy came very quickly, but I've never had to do that. Room service breakfast was NOT worth the price--$47 for tepid scrambled eggs, limp bacon and soggy toast with near-frozen butter.\\nLove the espresso bar, Drybar, and the comfy beds though! We'd stay again at the right price, and would go elsewhere for breakfast.\\nStaff were very helpful and polite. I stayed here for two nights with my husband and two ying kids, and loved that the hotel has a Burger Joint, great breakfast place and pool on site. It is also within walking distance to Central Park, which we loved. The hotel and staff were great, the hotel itself is nice, and the rooms were fine. However, they do charge for every little thing: coffee, Saturday paper, Wi-Fi and use of the pool and gym. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. I booked the hotel on short notice, and was only going to NY for a short stay. The service was great, rooms were clean, ambiance was nice. Wish I would have been able to stay longer. I would stay here again. Not right in Times Square, but easy walking distance to all the sites. Stayed here as I couldn't get in to my favourite hotel, Essex House. Now I remember why I like the Essex House so much. The Parker Meridien charge top dollar rates and therefore that sets your expectations. Aside from location I dont know how they justify the rates.\\nThe room is basic though the bed is very comfortable. No tea or coffee making facilities, no complimentary water in the room, actually no frills at all. Internet is also chargeable and not very quick either.\\nThe one thing that annoyed me more than anything was being asked to pay extra to use the gym facilites. I have never experienced that before and I could tell the guy on the gym reception was deeply embarassed to tell me. Poor guy. It's a really cheap policy by the hotel to try and screw every last dime out of you. I won't stay here again. Well, it is all relative. I had dozen or so stays in NYC over last years, and this is definitely one of the better stays. I moved for one night from much worse hotel with the price tag astronomically high. Usually, in NYC you settle for less room, service or location, due to very high prices. I had really good deal, and being Gold Preferred Guest of Starwood doesn't hurt either. No complains about location, service and size of the room. All was very good. Bar and breakfast prices are way too high, no need to eat or drink there. Had a nice quiet room, without the view though. The room had a bit dated and tired decor, although quite a good size. Internet should be free, not as Gold status perk. Would recommend to stay there, if the price is right: definitely under $300. Le Meridiem Parker combines classic elements and also modern desing and facilities. They have a fancy bar and a great burger place at the same enviroment. It's worthy to pay the fee for the pool, this is one of the greatest views you will have from the city and you can lay at the sun looking to the city and the Central Park.\\nViviana and Stefanie from the Front Desk were so nice!! They were very friendly, smart and made me feel comfortable and definetely made my stay much enjoyable.\\nBy the way, they are just few steps from Central Parl and some block from Times Square!!\\nI definetely recommend it.\\nRodrigo Casanova I go here off and on and absolutely love the location. It's close to Columbus Circle and Central Park and minutes away from Fifth Avenue. When I think of traveling to NYC I immediately think\\nOf staying here. They often have Flash sales or promotions for the $250 to $299 range, however\\nWhen you get the notice via Starwood, hotels.com etc those prices are gone, either from a blackout date or the Hotel claims\" sorry that rate is no longer in our system\".then you are stuck in the $500 range for a king bedded room.and really unless you go on Business and your company\\nWill pay or have disposable income( which I don't)then who can really afford that? The last time I stayed there was last spring for a few nites, I was awoken very early in the morning with sounds\\nThat felt like an earthquake( which everyone else in the hotel felt as well). Apparently and with\\nNo prior notice to me a new building was going up right next door. The Meriden Hotel was litterly\\nShaking from the jack hammering. I asked for a modification in my room rate and they said no.\\nI was surprised considering this is supposed to be a 4 or 5 star Hotel. I did think they would have\\nOffered me a free breakfast or 1/2 of my next stay, anything but alas nothing.\\nI must stay the staff is very friendly , and beds are very comfortable and location great,but unless you get good value then look elsewhere, there are plenty of hotels in New York City,\\nLy My wife thinks I am a hotel snob, maybe. I booked the Le Parker Meridian because a friend was also staying there. I couldn't have been more pleased. Outstanding service was provided from the moment we walked through the lobby. Our room was ready and very nice with modern decor and a view of Central Park. The hotel was convenient to everything we wanted to do in NY and the subway was a short block away for the trip to the WTC Memorial. This hotel exceeded my expectations and we were 100% satisfied with our stay. The staff were friendly and helpful to two newcomers on their first visit to NY, the bar on the ground floor of the hotel had the best cappuccino, I thought I was in Italy.\\nGreat stay, excellent service and best of all, one very happy wife. I have had a wonderful experiences at this Hotel in the past but after the last two stays they are now off my list. The staff is very good at the desk and in sending someone to help with the air conditioning.(The air conditioner was dirty too.) The room was dirty, we had to go buy socks so our feet would stay clean. the carpets were stained. The bed covers had stuff on them and the cover sheet was not supplied on one of the beds. I hate to tell you what a bear blanket was like. The chair in the room had no table how do you put a drink or anything down. The TV has no movies or TV guide station. I could not wait to get out of that room and pay my 600.00 for the experience . Upon arrival we decided to see if our room was ready early and to our surprise it was ! It was nice to check in unload our bags and go sight see . We decided to ride bikes through Central Park . Great experience.I love Central Park !\\nWe came back to the hotel to shower and change and saw all these people standing in line next to a curtain wall so I asked why was there a line and was told that is the famous hambuger rest !.We were hungry so we decided to check it out . Food was great ! small room but very good non the less !\\nOur Hotel room was very large on the other hand by New York Hotel room standards and the bathroom was also very nice size. Very modern and up to date !!!\\nI would love to come back and stay again at this hotel as they say location,location ! Nice location, always spotless, yummy room service food, fun quirky old cartoons and film clips shown in the elevators, cute bar area, entrances on both 56th and 57th Streets, modern, simple chic rooms, nice shower, soft fluffy bathrobe, soft fluffy white towels, blow dryer provided, good flatscreen TV and channels.\\nOver the years I've had some temperature problems. They don't tell you (and I tend to forget in between stays) that the thermostat which appears to regulate the room doesn't in fact regulate the room... you figure it out in the middle of the night when you're burning up and you keep turning the air down but eventually realize it's not changing. The only solution to it being too hot in wintertime is to open the windows. Unfortunately, when I try I can never get them open (it's usually in the middle of the night). But if I ever remember to ask when I check in, the hotel will send somebody up to open the window for me. Also be aware, they just don't tell you some things! For example, I found out from another guest at my most recent stay there is actually a pool on the property. I never imagined there was one, and they never mentioned it and I've stayed here regularly for almost 20 years! Would you believe in all these years of having me as a regular customer, they never once mentioned to me they are part of a rewards program I could have joined? Just found out about that today while staying at an entirely different hotel. I also didn't know until recently that they have a famous Burger restaurant on site, but it's unmarked and behind a sort of curtain and nobody mentions it to you or tells you about it. I found that out from a native New Yorker friend of mine. In their effort to be chic and hip, they act almost a little too chic and hip at times. (Like, if they have to TELL you they have a famous burger joint behind the curtain, then you aren't the kind of person they really want eating at the burger joint.) I believe they have a fitness center that costs extra to use. They have a small gift shop and bar area. When I forgot a toothbrush on my most recent stay I asked for one at the front desk but they told me I'd have to buy one at the gift shop. Then they confided that the one at the gift shop would be overpriced (which I appreciated) so I should go to Duane Reade (which I did). I've occasionally had a few problems. For example major construction on a visit in the past year meant a giant, and I mean really loud constant banging sound in my room. Upon checkout I told them how bad the noise had been. They seemed nonchalant and sort of shrugged it off. They didn't seem to care that I had a problem. There is a barber shop/beauty salon on the premises, though I haven't had occasion to use it. If you're taking a taxi around the city, don't go out the 56th St. entrance where you'll have to tip the bellman and get a cab that may be angry if you're not going to the airport. Instead, go out the back entrance on 57th St. and wave down a cab yourself. Great location. Walk to Central Park, try the campy diner Moon Rock Cafe on 57th St. nearby, lots of great eateries in 3-4 block area. Beautiful hotel in a convenient location between pretty much any subway stop desired and two blocks from Central Park and many museums. The park view room is fantastic, with stunning view of the park - a breath of fresh air from looking at the city! Service is helpful, but not outstanding, and although the furnishings are nice with some modern touches, you can also see the wear come through. Rates were lower than normal which made it a great value, may not recommend otherwise. I found this hotel to be perfectly well-situated, staffed with knowledgable professionals and a nice change from the gigantic Manhattan mega-hotels. My room was large by NY standards, well-maintained and the bed, was ridiculously comfortable. I'm a SPG member, so this is my new default hotel to book in NY. This is a terrific hotel property. Nice finish out, great location and friendly/helpful staff. The rooms are very clean/modern and well furnished. They even provide Herman Miller chairs next to the built in office desk.\\nThere were only 2 items which left me wanting. First, the hotel did not have any sort of Iphone charger clock and one of the outlets I tried to use to recharge my iphone was not functioning. Second, the price of the hotel was fairly expensive. I paid $575 for 1 night in a standard room, on a Wednesday. I think for $575 you can pretty much stay at just about any hotel in NYC and next time I'll check out the Mandarin Oriental. The high price is also apparent at breakfast where a glass of orange juice costs $10. \\nAll in all it was a great stay and I have no regrets, but for me to consider going here again I'd like to see a price point closer to $350-400 a night for a mid-week stay.\\nHope this helps! While visiting NY as I did every second week i decided to use some of my SPG points to try the Parker Meridien and we are so glad that i did. I then made this my first choice when visiting NY and now that we have moved here, always urge family, colleagues and friends to consider and stay at the Parker Meridien.\\nThe rooms are big and comfortable, the room service delicious and the overall atmosphere of the lobby and hotel fantastic. Breakfast at Norma's is a MUST! There are so many choices and hotel guests get preferential seating even if you do not have a reservation. The burger joint always has a line-up and were the most simple yet perfect burgers and worth the wait.\\nThe staff at the front desk were great and when i sent a thank you to the Manager Sylvie, i received a response within 48 hours. Overall the Parker was fantastic and if you are considering it, make the reservation, eat on site and enjoy every minute of it. Nice location at 56th & 6th with friendly staff and impressive lobby... However, the city view was of the back of a building with scaffolding and workers at our window and the bathroom was tiny, outdated and the door couldn't open without hitting the toilet. Bellmen,doormen & valet pass off the bags so frequently it costs us $45 to get out of the hotel with one bag! We stayed there only for one night (Saturday) before fashion week, so i imagine the hotel was probably more busy. But the overall experience was a bit like staying at the busy train station. We arrived at the hotel st 1.30 p.m. the wait for check in was 10 or so minutes. The girl informed us that our room is not ready and please come back at 3. OK the check-in time is 3 p.m. but normally most large hotels can give you a room by 1.30. When we came back at 3 p.m. and after staying in line for another 10 minutes we were told that our room is still not ready and come back in an hour. No explanation or apology was offered. \\nWaiting for the elevator takes A LOT of patience so be ready to wait and wait and wait. \\nThe gym is $10 and the pool is $10. Funny that they call it hotel amenities when you have to pay for them separately. Why stop at the gym, maybe they should charge for the elevator say a buck per ride and if customers dont want to pay they can use stairs.. \\nThe concierge (we only dealt with the older gentlemen) was as helpful as \"tourist information\" center. When asked to recommend a place for brunch with outdoor seating on Sunday the only suggestions was sarabeth's - this place is in every tourist guide; yes its good but on Sunday if you want to get a table you need to wait for at least 1 hour! \\nThe rooms were good; large and comfortable. Wif is paid for service ...so annoying.. \\nNYC has a lot of great hotels but this one is not it. Yes it has a nice bar and its buzzy but if you want a nice service and a smile and maybe something a little more exclusive and intimate this is not the place to stay. There are better places to stay in the city. \\nP.S. Just a note to say we did use our starwood points to book this hotel, so maybe that's why we got I used my SPG points to stay 5 nights at the Parker Meridien for the US Open. The location was perfect for us (Midtown Manhattan) as it was close to everything we needed, especially the subway. The room (Jr. Suite) was spacious with modern decor. The two things I didn't like about the room was that it only has one TV (it was mounted on a wall that swivels back and forth between the sitting area and the bed) and no coffee maker. \\nI did think that the front desk clerk that checked us in could have been a little more friendly. She didn't confirm the type of room we were assigned until I asked about it. I would expect a little more courtesy from the front desk, especially since I'm a Starwood Gold member I have to say that the hotel is perfectly located and has easy access to almost every place you will want to go to the city. The rooms were extremely clean and surprisingly quiet. We were there for almost a week and never heard any traffic noise or horns so sleep was never a problem. The bar area was lovely and we enjoyed sitting with a glass of wine or coffee. And don't miss the burger joint...best burgers in NYC!\\nThe problem area was the lack of amenities in our room. First of all there was not a coffee pot! Yes there is room service, but i want my own coffee pot i don't want to wait for someone to bring me coffee every morning. Also, there was only one chair, no table, and most of all....NO DRESSER! The room was very spacious for a new York hotel, there was plenty if space for a dresser or a small table to eat if you order room service. There was only one drawer...come on...we are two people staying for a week in new York!!!!! I have clothes...lots of clothes and shoes and no place to put them! I would think that that for $500+ per night they could put in a couple of drawers and a coffee pot! Okay so I consider this hotel much more than a hotel and that is why I love it. \\nThe room's have been slightly touched up recently (carpets and wall paper). Also, for NYC the rooms are spacious.\\nThe best part is what the hotel has on site...\\nNorma's - The best breakfast... ever.\\nMoonshine - The coolest/unique spa... ever\\nThe gym is HUGE.\\nIts a urban resort...Enjoy! my daughter and I stayed at the le parker meredien hotel. the stay was fantastic, the burger bar is not to be missed. Hotel rooms very comfortable.the hotel is well situated , easy acces to all amenities. have staye din other meredien hotels in europe and would stay with any other group. excelent service and value for money. We had a nice stay at the Meridien. Our second time there with kids in tow. We took advantage of the family special and got a spacious and comfortably outfitted room. The rooms are looking a little tired, but they are a good size by NYC standards. The kids loved swimming in the pool and the proximity to the park and kid friendly attractions in NYC was a boon. The staff was not as attentive, or friendly as they were during our previous stay and at times seemed downright out of it. When we went down to pay for the sitter we had booked well in advance through the concierge desk, as instructed, we were told there was no sitter booked and that we couldn't put the charges to our room as we'd been told previously. After much confusion and back and forth between the concierge and the reception the whole thing was sorted out and we did indeed get our babysitter and the method of payment was accepted. Only exception would be the bellman, who especially made the kids feel welcome from the moment we arrived. We were hoping to eat at the burger joint but the lines were too long. We will return to the Parker again, we hope it'll be less busy (we were there during the Tennis Grand Slam) and we'll have better service. We stayed here first week of September and arrived home yesterday. Couldn't rate this place high enough to be honest. We were on the 38th floor, sweet view of Central Park. Nice big room, big TV, 6ft bed. Everyone we dealt with couldn't help enough. If there was one very minor issue, there wasn't an ice machine on our floor although the front desk were more than happy to send up a bucket when we needed it.\\nWe didn't use the hotel bar, restaurant or the gym, but (and here's a biggie), we did get several takeouts from the Burger Joint which is located just off the front desk. Seriously, if you like a great burger, then this is THE place.\\nWe hope to make it back soon! Arrived at the hotel at about 8:30 am after a 9 hour flight from Hawaii and was pleasantly surprised to find that our room was ready. We used SPG points and paid for an upgrade to a view of central park but Michael at the front desk informed us that there were only rooms with partial view. We decided to forego the upgrade and Michael put us in a room on the ninth floor with a partial view of Central Park anyway. The bellman, Maurice was also very courteous and helpful with a lot of information. These two individuals started our stay in New York on a very positive note and we enjoyed Norma's for breakfast. The Burger joint did not live up to its hype. We thought it was good but not one of the best we've had. The location is very close to Central Park so we rented two bicycles and had a nice ride around the entire park. There are some small hills to climb and my wife (65 years young) does not exercise regularly so we did have to walk our bikes in several areas. Although very close to Central Park, the location on 56th St is quite a distance from Times Square and say 41st St where Newsies is playing. Enjoyed our stay. I've been going there for business trips to NYC for 18 years now -- wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. Terrific rooms, awesome staff! OH and did I mention the breakfasts at Norma's and the food at the Burger Joint? First class all the way! great room, location and experience, placed in midtown manhattan, just a few blocks from central park, carnegie hall and 5th avenue. rooms are rather large, very clean and quiet, bed comfortable. staff was helpful (a special thanks to lamia for her kindness). top floor pool with a spectacular view. burger joint is worth visiting though there can be some awsom I really liked this location, close to the park, right between east and west sides. Starbucks is immediately adjacent on both sides of the hotel, and a 24 hr grocery is on the corner. Rooms were very spacious for the price and there was plenty of storage. Our Jr Suite had a great built in desk with good lighting, I enjoyed eating breakfast there and reading the NYTimes. Excellent, large shower and the towels were good, a must for me. However, I thought the bed was not very comfy and the pillows were cheap.\\nWe were there over Labor Day and the US Open was going on, there was a big crush in the mornings and some guests reported up to a 30 minute wait for an elevator to get down to the lobby, yikes! We were on more of a night schedule so this didn't affect us.\\nStaff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, I like the renovation and feel the rooms are clean and modern. For the $ I preferred this to the St Regis, and I think this location is better. Our group of four couples stayed over the Labor Day weekend. We were all very pleased with the hotel. The service at the front desk from arrival until we left was excellent. \\nWe ate breakfast at Norma's for three days straight. To say that Norma's food is exceptional doesn't even come close to describing the amazing food. There is a waffle dish called WaZa that is unique and includes a cornucopia of fruit. The prices are fairly high (at least for what I am used to in Houston), but are worth the cost (except possibly the $9 orange juice).\\nTo work off the calories from Norma's, we exercised downstairs at Gravity. The gym is excellent -- especially the spacious weightroom on the 2nd floor.\\nThe one challenge with the hotel is that when it is a busy time of day, the elevators can be a little slow. Also, one of the elevators had doors that were not working well over the weekend, so they opened and closed slowly.\\nThe location for Le Parker Meridien is superb. We were able to walk to Central Park and Times Square. Also, Calvary Baptist was right across the street.\\nOverall, we highly recommend Le Parker Meridien. We were fortunate enough to have chosen to stay at LPM during our recent weekend in New York. With the blurring amount of hotels in the city it is often difficult to choose where to stay, and often you end up in a nice hotel but stay in a 10x9 room. That is not the case at all here. The rooms are very nice and very roomy for NYC. Obviously if you look at the location you'll see that you are right between broadway and central park so you never have far to go. The hotel staff are very helpful from the front desk check in, to the concierge, to the bell staff. We recommend staying here if you have the chance. Perhaps industrial minimalist is your thing... then LPM is your hotel.\\nIve been looking forward to staying here for quite some time. Business and opportunity brought me here at fairly decent corporate rate - still it was slightly disappointing. And the opportunity to get an upgraded room is probably nil since its a common known fact that most biz travelers have the SPG Am3x card.The fact that biz travelers prefer SPG properties is going to hinder your chances at getting that upgrade or prime corner room, etc. I got a room with a shared door... first couple of days was fine... I think the person next to me was playing in the US Open?! I noticed a US Open limo waiting outside as a cart was being taken from the room with a huge tennis racquet bag... and then the problem occurred. A fairly loud couple moved in the following day. Lucky enough they sleep pretty early and I didnt hear a peep after 11pm. However, my preference was for a quiet room -- which the receptionist seemed to obliged with a room away from the elevator and away from ice machine. But shared door aside...\\nPros:\\nModern room\\nLack of huge furniture pieces made the room seem pretty big for NY standards\\nClean, lovely cleaning staff\\nGreat lobby and entrance, bar area and burger joint (slightly hidden - didnt go but heard positive reviews)\\nTV is massive at prob 46\"\\ndesk is great set against window...love that\\nhowever, my room faced hilton club... with windows looking back... great for working not great for \"browsing\" NY sky line \\nlocation is fantastic... near Central Park, but a bit of drive to hot spot restaurants in lower Manhattan... but far away from time square to give you some peace.\\nduane reades and chase banks nearby... Fifth Ave shops one street down... great location all around \\nCons:\\nfelt underwhelming relative to expectations\\nmodern as in minimalist industrial cold feel... probably not my think... although i like 'modern'\\nwifi is $17 per connection, thats right per connection, although that might be the norm around here (not sure if you can swap the 'registered' connection to dif PC/tablet/smartphone)\\nbathroom pretty small\\nshaving razor is $7; how about free? is that too much to ask\\nIs there a lobby to relax? not sure... wasnt told or invited\\ngym, $10, i suppose thats not awfully outrageous... not sure is thats entirely common here\\njust not much to warrant an immediate return... as i type from another NY hotel room which is tiny compared to LPM but fantastically designed... review to come. Ordered room service several times... its good food... pizza is good, breakfast is great... prices are high. couldnt get the bill under $50/meal... might have been worth it to go downstairs in the restaurant.\\nSummary... great location, great size, good layout, ok feel. New York is expensive.. your expectations should be as well. placed in midtown manhattan, just a few blocks from central park, carnegie hall and 5th avenue. rooms are rather large, very clean and quiet, bed comfortable. staff was helpful (a special thanks to lamia for her kindness). top floor pool with a spectacular view. burger joint is worth visiting though there can be some queue to get in. be prepared to pay for any extra. additional fees are charged to your bill for the use of gym, pool and internet. My husband and I have stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 14 years. Since then, it has become part of the Starwood chain which we love. The rooms are lovely, nicely renovated in a contemporary fashion but not over done. Friendly front desk, concierge, and bell man staff. We have a very special feeling for this hotel and for a longtime member if it's staff, Naji. He saved my huband's life in 1998 and we will never forget his kindness and professionalism. My husband was not feeling well that day but refused to see a doctor. Naji helped to change rooms because, at that time, we detected cigarette smoke. That is no longer an issue. Naji looked at my husband and said \"Mr. B, you don't look well, may I call the house doctor for you.\"My husband listened to Naji , the house doctor came, and to make a long story short, my huband was extremely ill. Had Naji not gotten my husband the medical attention he needed, he might have died. There are many wonderful employees here and the location is terrific. I have not eaten in the main restaurant in many years but enjoyed the hip burger bar a couple of years ago. If Le Parker Meridien is in your budget, I highly recommend it. Prices vary with the season and availability.\\nSincerely, \\nSue B. Have stayed here twice recently - once for a weekend trip with my husband in Dec 2011 and again in August 2012 with husband and 2 kids in tow. \\nClean hotel, friendly, courteous staff. Rooms updated and spacious. Close to all major midtown attractions. Walk to Central Park, museums, hop two blocks over to the top of 5th Avenue and hike down about 15 min walk to Times Square. \\nUpgraded to Junior Suite on our first visit and booked jr suite again to accomodate two kids on a pull-out sofa. I have been at this hotel few years ago.\\nI found new decorated rooms and flat screen TV. Rooms are quite large and not that noisy, despite to be in very busy NY!\\nIf you manage to have an high floor with central park view.....is fantastic.\\nConcierge is outstanding, efficient and friendly. \\nGreat location, close to central Park and 5th and broadway.\\nSome negatives?? the minimbar: DO NOT TOUCH IT! is an electronic system, you will be charged if you touch the bottles!!\\nbreakfast is too expensive, but easy to have it just outside the hotel. I am an SPG member gold and I was upgraded to 35th floor. What a view!! Last minute booking, it´s an amazing location because you are minutes to the park, half of block to metro and few block from time square. Quiet, elegant, refined, and amazing service Stayed here one night for wedding. Received a double upgrade as a SPG Gold. Front desk was helpful and knowledgeable.\\nJunior Suite is very spacious and well appointed.\\nNorma's the restaurant is expensive, but tasty and the portions are huge. Make sure to get a reservation ahead of time.\\nPool on the rooftop is beautiful.\\nOnly minor thing- Bathrooms are nice, but could use a few minor upgrades. Westin or Element type shower heads would be a nice touch.\\nOverall: Best Value near central park. Great Hotel My wife and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary with a trip to NYC, so when our 20th was coming up, I planned a return (surprise) trip to NYC. When choosing a hotel that was in a good neighborhood and close to attractions we wanted to take in (Times Square, ABC, the theater district), the Le Parker Meridien seemed like a great fit.\\nWe had an excellent view of Central Park from our room on the 26th floor, appreciated the friendliness of the staff from the front desk check-in to asking advice from the concierge. The \"bonus\" came when we returned to our room after supper our first night and found a nice plate of fruit and chocolate-covered strawberries along with a bottle of water and a note, wishing us a Happy Anniversary--totally unexpected. Someone paid attention to my comments about this being a surprise trip for our 20th anniversary and took the extra steps to make it special for us.\\nIf we return to NYC, I'll be sure to strongly consider staying at the Le Parker Meridien again! We booked to go to New York very last minute through expedia in fact we booked and flew the very same day! Was very lucky as when we checked in with british airways they noticed it was my birthday and upgraded us to buisness class a very good start. Once we arrived at Le Parker Le Meridien we were met by the doorman who was very friendly as it was late and we were tired/jet lagged etc.. He took us to the front desk got us all checked in and even took us up to our room showed how to put black out blinds etc and suggested we try to stay awake and have a drink in the coctail bar for at least an hour to climatise and then go to sleep. The next morning after sleeping great in our very comftable bed we headed down for breakfast to Norma's which is part of our hotel,we had the best panckes i have ever tasted they were amazing! It is in an ideal situation for the best shopping experiance you are gonna ever have! We later headed back to the hotel and went straight up onto the roof for a swim to cool off as was very hot and lounged in the sun the rest of the afternoon before heading down for a beautiful meal in the resturaunt next door which is part of the hotel. We definitley will return to this hotel on our next visit to New York! Also visit the secret burger bar for a real New York burger even the stars visit here and have signed there names on the wall this is situated behind a curtain just off reception area! I was amazed at the hotel staff, their genuine and caring attitude, especially Sylvia at the front desk, and even the telephone answering staff were so pleasant. The Meridien is clean, modern, and perfectly located...\\nI'm a W fan, but, no more.\\nI am a new Meridian Fan...\\nJean-Guy \\nCEO \\nTagga My friend and I stayed the weekend at this hotel and had an enjoyable experience. The staff were friendly upon arrival and had provided me with a larger than average room. The room was extremely quiet, had comfortable sheets and nice toiletries. Would have liked to have utilized the Dry Bar however each day they were not able to fit me in due to the popularity. Make sure to make a reservation for this service before arriving if interested. There is a beautiful cocktail bar inside and a Starbucks directly across the street. The location is unbeatable. I would definitely recommend. I was immediately put off by the front desk agent calling me \"hon\" at least four times in the five minutes it took to check us in. We booked a jr. Suite. It was a descent size but the furnishings and decor were very dated. Also a shower no bath tub. We were traveling with young kids so that was a negative. A good portion of the space in the room was taken by an entertainment center holding a huge TUBE tv. It seemed silly and out of place. We love to stay in midtown so location was great. the roof top pool was a real plus for the kids. I've stayed here before and had great experience a few years ago. I was disappointed this time and I don't think I'd stay here again. Far too many hotel options in NYC to settle for barely ok. We choose this because of the central location and large rooms, and neither disappointed. there was disappointment though that they charge for the pool - which is small - on the top floor. Also there was a lack of information in the room on hotel amenities. so we had to ask about restaurant openings etc. My husband and I recently stayed at Le Parker Meridien. Wonderful hotel, wonderful location. We had a nice room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would like to go back again, this time with the kids. The only complaint I had would be that the room had a slightly musty smell to it, but it was clean and very nicely decorated. It was very modern and stylish, and the rooftop area had spectacular views. This is my second review of this hotel. I needed a room with 3 beds and emailed one of the guest relations manager prior to my stay and she was able to secure me a Jr. Suite with 3 beds. As a frequent traveler its nice to have people at hotels you frequent able to handle those special requests you may have once in a while. The room was excellent, renovated and very spacious by NYC standards. \\nThis hotel has an excellent location great burger joint, Normas for breakfast, nice indoor pool and excellent service. You can walk to Central park, 5th ave, Rock Center and subways are lcoated near by. I have stayed at all the SPG branded hotels in NYC except the ST Regis and this hotel is one of my favorities. I look forward to coming back in a few months for the holiday season. You can read my previous review on Tripadvisor on the Le Parker Meridien and please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks This is a nice hotel with an attentive staff just south of Central Park. I was there recently and really needed a late checkout....despite being completely packed, they gave me a 5 pm checkout.\\nAn added bonus is the burger joint just off the lobby. It is always packed, but if you ave the time, it is worth it. What can I say--we got a great rate in August and it definitely was worthwhile, given the price and the location. The rooms are really small (but probably not small for New York), so if you can, get a junior suite. It's a bit more, but basically, you get another room. The hotel rooms are standard mid-budget corporate--curtained shower, smaller than you'd think bed, and typical hotel furniture. Also, no amenities are included--you pay an extra $16 per room for pool/gym access and another $16 for wi-fi. But my big complaint would be the elevators--the one time I had to be somewhere on time, I waited 20 minutes for an elevator, which never arrived, and had to run down 30 flights of stairs (in heels). Service is fine, not extraordinary. For $200-400, it's worth it. More than that, not so much. Also the lobby bar is small, and the mixed drinks are killer strong. Just be warned. I used to come to this hotel frequently and was excited to return mostly due to the gym. I stayed here for a weekend in August.\\nThe gym, \"gravity,\" has changed a lot; no more racquetball courts, now a cafe and nail salon, etc. plus a it spot of the second floor is reserved for those circuit training machines that measure slow range of motion rather than being a normal machine. But it's still a great gym, even If non-platinum SPG members have to pay $20 to use.\\nSame fees apply for the rooftop pool, which is a little on the small size for laps, but is still good enough for a short workout and apparently one of the few pools in the area. The interior greenhouse surrounding the pool was a bit of a terrarium however.\\nRoom itself was good though there was a big chunk knocked out a corner of one of my walls, which needed repair. Bathroom amenities by Paul Thomas Roth were fine but on the small side. \\nSoundproofing was pretty good, and yes, the room was indeed larger than most NYC rooms (and mine looked northward toward Central Park). Elevators are hit and miss.\\nBell desk is totally understaffed so make sure to leave an extra half-hour in there when retrieving bags. Nice hotel and outstanding burger joint :-). My preferred hotel in nyc? Our room was perfectly fitted even for a one week stay like ours and everything was handy and comfortable. The location is perfect for visiting midtown manhattan and very close to theater dist and times square. Everything is actually near once you get subway station access close to your hotel in nyc Rooms are well equipped, people were lovely to deal with, location was super convenient, and there is a Drybar in the basement. Loved my 5 night stay. Wish it could have been 10! Pool on the 41st floor was treat as well. Internet seemed a little pricey but 3G worked well. Fantastic location, close to central park, subway, 5th avenue etc. The room was a standard size room with king bed and good quality sheets, generous size bathroom with quality toiletires provided. I did find the room quite dark even with the curtains open, due to the paint colour and dark coloured furnishings and the close proximity of surrounding buildings. The service was good, friendly staff at check in, and the concierge were very helpful in providing me with directions to make my way around NYC. The cafe attached to the hotel served good quality coffee too. If you are looking for a hotel in a fantastic location, I would recommend this hotel. Accomodations & guest service were all very good (with the exception of the sofa bed in the suite being uncomfortable, but aren't they all?). Location is very convenient to subways, park, shopping, and very walkable to most of Midtown. The room did get noisy during the late evening hours when they seemed to be hauling debris from the construction site next door, but I assume this is a temporary issue. Two specific items cost the fifth star on this one.\\nFirst, $15 add on charge for the pool is silly and a bit offensive. When I'm paying high end prices for a high end room, I hate being nickeled & dimed. Anyone paying for a room at this hotel can easily afford the $15, so I don't believe it's there to keep the \"riff raff\" out of the pool. Just add the cost onto the room and save us the bother of having to fill out the form confirming we'll fork over the few bucks for a swim!\\nSecond, the rooms lack any information about the hotel itself, other than a room service menu for Norma's. When I inquired whether it was something that was supposed to be in our room but might be missing, a staffer explained to me that the hotel purposely does not use signage or provide informational binders in the room because they want the guests to have to interact with the staff. I must be missing something here because I fail to see how inconveniencing me in that I have to go to or call the front desk/concierge to find out basic hotel info (where is the pool, what are the hours of the onsite dining/bar establishments, how does one access the tower elevators going to the health club, etc.) is a good marketing strategy. \\nOther than those two minor annoyances, we really enjoyed our stay and would return again. I just returned from a 3-night stay at Le Parker Meridien in midtown NYC. There is no doubt the location of the hotel is great. Easy 2-7 minutes walk to 3 different subway stations (with different subway lines), and just a block from Central Park. \\nI have to take off two points because:\\n- The iron in my room didn't work. When I called housekeeping to request another one, I was told it'll be brought right up. 30 minutes later, no iron. I called again, was told it'll be on its way shortly. 15 minutes go by, still no iron. Called a third time, this time I said I will need to speak with management if it's not brought up in 5 minutes. Finally, the iron showed up minutes later. But 50 minutes to get an iron brought up, for a hotel in this class with the high room rates to match, I expected better.\\n- The elevators, though fairly fast, there's not enough of them when one goes out of service. One morning, 1 of the 3 elevators was out of service. I stayed on 5th floor. Waited 7 minutes before an elevator showed up, but of course it was full. Not wanting to wait another 7 minutes, I opted to walk down the staircase. Here's where the problem began. The doors inside the staircase are not labeled. I went down several flights of stairs and couldn't find a door with \"lobby\" written on it. When I finally opened a door, I was already in the basement. I had to find another set of stairs to make my way back up to the ground level, and exit the building. I can't imagine what would happen if there's an emergency when stair use is mandatory.\\n- Sound insulation is generally good. I couldn't hear the neighbors, but was able to hear the elevators (my room is next to the elevator shaft).\\nOther than these issues, the room is well appointed and clean. Nothing exceptional though. My windows faced a construction site, so no views to speak of. Very friendly staff, clean rooms, concierge was very helpful. Overall a great experience.\\nthe issues...the internet was down and i called and got transferred and then placed on hold and left with no one returning after 10 minutes causing me to hang up and call again just to get placed back on hold again with the company who provides them their internet.\\nthe other issues was when i checked in..american express platinum says you get free upgrades with starwood hotels. when i asked about it he looked confused and said no. i said you sure it is suppose to be automatic and he said no. He said no we don't offer it for that card. if he would have looked and confirmed it would have been nice because i was under the impressions from AMEX that you get it if available. \\nBut all things considered it was a great experience...and the breakfast was great in the hotel! The room was very comfortable and the staff was very polite. I especially noticed the sheets, which were comfortable and of high quality, and we loved the rotating tv panel. Some minor cleanliness issues with the room were immediately dealt with to our satisfaction by the staff, which we very much appreciated. Norma's is absolutely amazing for brunch, although you should make advance reservations if you plan to eat here on the weekend. Before you book the hotel, though, be aware that there are extra charges to use the gym and to use the pool, a fee to use the internet, plus parking your car is about $50 per night. These charges can quickly add $100 per night to your bill. If you are used to these sorts of charges, then I would highly recommend the hotel. I am a frequent traveler to very nice hotels in NYC, LA and Chicago, and this is the first time I have been charged for gym or pool use and it clouded my impression of the hotel. Perhaps I should have looked more closely at their web site, where I would hope they mention these additional charges. I was torn between 4 and 5 stars. But the fact that I came home relaxed, oh so relaxed pushed this into a 5 star event. The rooms are reserved. Nice not overly done. For me just right. Large for New York. LPM has its own style for sure. The staff were always helpful and great. I had a room view of the park. So worth it. Great alternative to the hustle bustle to the south. With so much food in the city I actually worked in a room service breakfast. Very good. The French Toast with caramel was created by Satan. I am still in a diabetic coma. I would do it again. Room had great wall mounted LCD. Only bad thing is there was no movies to select from. Which I think is why I was totally able to unplug. Great location. Multiple subway lines nearby. I walked the city. Good cardio for Norma's French Toast. And the park is 2 blocks away. Again great exercise opportunities. Will be back. I stayed here for 2 nights on business because my client had a corporate rate. The location on 56th between 6th and 7th is fine, close to Central Park and Carnegie Hall. There is a Starbucks right across the street.\\nThe rooms are big for NYC, although the bathrooms are tight. The bedding and towels were nice. There is a nice big desk area if you need to do work in the room. There is a minibar, but it is one of those that if you so much as touch something, you are charged for it. To me, it would be better if these hotels just had an empty fridge. There are so many drugstores and groceries nearby that you can easily (and more cost effectively) buy your own snacks. The front desk seemed efficient. My check in experience was good -- the person who helped me was very nice and the process was fast. \\nTwo issues to keep in mind: 1) The safe in Le Parker Meridien was in the most awkward position I've ever seen in any hotel -- on the floor in the closet with the back of the safe against the side wall of the closet. You have to sit on the floor and contort your body to put things in the safe. Honestly, a larger person, an older person or anyone with mobility problems would not be able to use the safe. 2) There is a major construction project next door to the west. Whether due to the fact that I was getting up early or the phase of the project, the noise did not bother me much, but it's something to keep in mind. If you want to ensure quiet, perhaps ask for a room that does not face the construction. I stayed at this hotel for a girls weekend in NYC and to go to a Broadway show, we didn't spend a lot of time is the room, if you are in NYC that the last thing you want to do! \\nthis hotel was OK, room size was great for NYC standers.\\nLocation is the best of this hotel! you are near all the attractions, walking distance from time square, central park, you have to try the burger bar, go there early for lunch! awesome burgers!\\nno real closet in the room, very old TV's very strange on a 4 stars hotel\\n Front desk staff was efficient but little bit of less rudeness will be great, check in and out was quick and easy.\\nhousekeeping service was excelent! and super friendly....\\noverall is a great hotel with a perfect midtown location if you find the right price this is the hotel for you! i paid around $150 per night so it was perfect! Love the junior suites. Great design. Nice upgrade, one of the largest rooms I've had in NY\\nLent me an umbrella in the rain!\\nBreakfast always packed. Room service expensive!\\nBar was good, pricey? \\nMy go to hotel in NYC, although pricing very variable. As a Platinum guest with SPG I travel quite a bit, and this is the worst Starwood property I've ever stayed at. My experience from start to end was horrible.\\nI booked two rooms for two nights with points, and used 4 suite upgrade certificates to ensure a good room. Turns out the certificates are a waste, as they won't upgrade anyone to a park view room \"per policy\".\\nUpon check in at noon I was told neither of my two rooms was available. My request for a park view room (noted my platinum concierge) was not mentioned at all. I asked if I should called in an hour to check on availability and was told someone would call my cell phone. t 2PM having gotten no call, I called and was told my room had been available since 1PM. I asked that a manager be available to explain when I checked in. At 2:30PM I checked in and the employee who promissed the call back was at the station next to where I checked in. I mentioned to the front desk agent that I never had a call back, and the first individual promptly claimed that my cell phone was \"busy\" and he had tried to call. All my cell phone calls are routed through a central phone system that logs all calls, and no one attempted to call my phone during the time period in question. A manager then came out, and stated that no one called me because they were still checking on the room. I asked him to explain why the other employee had a different story, and the two gentlemen began to argue. I asked 4 times that they have a general manager contact me, and was told no the first three times, but finally told someone would contact me. Another manager called me, and gave me two possible explanations but would not explain why one of the two people I spoke to at the front desk had lied to me. Starwood and the hotel refuse to comment on the matter.\\nAfter using the shower for the first time, it immediately backed up. I called down and was told someone would be right up to fix it. After more than 45 minutes no one showed up and I called again. Someone then came right away to fix it. This was after bedtime for my child, so it was quite inconvenient.\\nWhen I went to pick up my car from valet on the final day I was astounded that they wanted me to walk in the rain down the block to the parking garage where the actually park the cars. As a matter of policy the refuse to actually pull them around to the valet stand where you dropped them off. American Express agreed this was fraud.\\nWhen I initially brought these matters to the attention of the Starwood Twitter team they responded with the insulting reply “Sounds like they are really busy in NYC today.”\\nThe in room movie system did not work at all, and no one bothered to mention it at check in, or put a warning on their website. The outage was scheduled, so they knew it was going to happen.\\nIf you are expecting a real platinum continental breakfast here, think again. All the hotel will offer you is coffee and a croissant. They claim since the coffee and croissants are custom made for them, they should be considered more than enough. Don’t expect to get your coffee early on a weekend either, you can’t get coffee at 7AM.\\nAfter all these issues, both the hotel and Starwood refused to offer any credit or compensation. I spent a night at Le Parker Meridien in New York City and it was enough to see the great value of the hotel. I highly recommand it, not just for business stays but also for leisure trips. The staff was very helpful and friendly and the rooms were very clean. I had an amazing view of the central park from my room. You will definitly enjoy your stay at Le Parker Meridien! This is the second time that I have stayed at Le Parker Meridien, and it was even better than the last experience! I stayed for three nights in late July. The room was very well-designed, clean and spacious and I had a great view of Central Park. One thing I observed was that all of the staff -- the bellhops, room service, housekeeping, concierge -- were very friendly, polite and helpful. It was more noticeable than the last time I was here. This is a nice surprise in a hotel this large. I did not go to The Burger Joint or Norma's but they are both wildly popular and have great reviews. This is a great midtown hotel and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. We had a really great time at Le Parker Meridien for a 3 night stay in early August. The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. The rooms were spotless and fresh towels awaited us daily. The water pressure in the showers was strong and amazing. The Burger Joint was delicious and trendy. The Knave bar was cool too. Pricey alcoholic drinks but REALLY good espresso drinks. The doormen were friendly and recognized me every day and asked about the previous night. One night after partying, we came back to the hotel at 3:30am and I asked him where I could get food, pronto, and he pointed me to a great food cart near by. I felt important and valued so I would definitely go back.\\nThe only snag: I booked the hotel through Magellan Vacations and was told we were guaranteed a Superior Double Park View room. When we got there, they tried to put us in a non-park view and I told them that we had a park view guarantee. They put us in a \"partially obstructed\" park view room and once we got into the room, it was clear that partially meant you could see the tiniest sliver of Central Park. Also we noticed the double beds are really just twin beds. Maybe a few inches wider. I've never seen beds that size before. Tiny. So we went down and said the beds were too small and the view was silly so we asked if they had a king bed room plus a roll away, regardless of view, because we wanted more space for sleeping. They immediately upgraded us to a Junior Suite with a king and a hide-a-bed. They said they'd look for the same room with a view and we could switch for our last two nights. We ended up staying in that room because we'd sort of \"moved in\" after the first night. It turns out we were hardly ever in the hotel room to enjoy the view, so it didn't matter anyways. Even though there were snags at the check in, I don't know if it was the fault of the booking agent or the hotel, and we got a good deal in the end, so I was happy overall. The room was the smallest on the floor plan but the price we paid, given the location in Midtown and the quality of the service, overall it was a bargain. The concierge was very helpful suggesting restaurants and making reservations for us. Two of the three dinner reservations were perfect. \\nThe burger joint in the lobby also made a good homemade style burger at a reasonable price (for New York). At check-in time I was told that even thought I'm a Platinum Starwood member, I would be much happier in a king room with a park view on the 31st floor, than a junior suite on a lower-level. Not so. Starting at 6:45am, there was incessant banging and clanking -- so loud, that even my Bose noise canceling headset failed. So loud, that I needed to take a work call on the toilet with the door closed. \\nAt 7:00 I opened the blinds to find 15 hard hat wearing construction workers staring into my room. On the 31st floor! Oh, and the park is completely blocked by the new structure. See accompanying pictures.\\nThere's no way I'll stay at the Le Meridien again -- far too many excellent hotels in NYC to bother. We love the junior suite and the movable tv. It was also nice to have a dining table and chairs when we brought in snacks or coffee from Starbuck's right across the street. Staff is very helpful and knows the best way to get anyplace in NY. We got some good tips on walking trips. Can't wait to come back. I almost had to look for a different hotel for my upcoming NYC trip and it was an awful feeling. I have stayed in so many Manhattan hotels but this is my favorite. If you can get a room overlooking Central Park... it is a breathtaking way to start your morning. The fitness room is phenomenal though I don't like that I have to pay extra for it. The only complaint I had was the wireless internet was spotty, but they told me after my issues they were going to revamp their whole system. The service is excellent and housekeeping is fast and accommodatingly proactive. Its the little service details that make this hotel extraordinary. The rooms are fresh and clean and it is always peaceful and quiet. \\nThey have a \"world famous\" burger joint in the hotel that is the size of a walk-in closet, and sometimes the lines midday run through the lobby. I tried the burger and it was... a burger. love the Le Parker Meridian ~ Crisp, Polished, Refined Chic Elegance with a Fun Flair! Service is the best and all the little things are fully lined up for each guest. I particulary like the large rooms with cozy and plush linens. The Gravity fitness center proivdes a top-notch workout facility right in the hotel and offers a variety of great group exercise classes. I particulary love the morning spin class! Great location - close to the N and R lines and a quick ride to downtown. Starbucks across the street is convenient as well. And above all ~ right at Central Park. Love this place and stay here whenever i am in NYC. We stayed here with some family members for a family get together for one evening. The room was not ready when we arrived at 11 am but we were able to check in by 2pm. It is in a great location. We were able to walk to Time Square etc. There was not a coffee maker in the room but there is a Starbucks across the street. I did not find the staff overly friendly but the room was clean. Some family members ate at the Burger Place and loved it. I was surprised that all the leather chairs in the lobby were peeling. I would think a hotel of this caliber would replace or fix them. Over all it was a nice stay ...clean room....excellent location. My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights while we were in the city for a wedding. I booked the hotel through Jetsetter for under $250/night. We had a corner room 1227 which didn't have a view but was more spacious that expected. At 300+ square feet it was definitely more space than we've had at comparable hotels in NYC. We didn't hear any of the construction noise that some others have complained about. \\nAmenities were basic, bed was average, peter thomas roth bath products were a plus. They hold $100/night for incidentals so I ordered room service one morning - ended up being $30 for just a bread basket. Having the dry bar located in hotel was really convenient since I wanted to get my hair done before the wedding (and honestly this is mostly why we booked at this hotel in particular) - my blow out was perfect.\\nThe staff were helpful and efficient but not particularly friendly. They were able to accommodate both an early check-in and late check-out without any trouble so no complaints! Le Parker Meridien was a great choice for our weekend away in NYC. We saw 2 shows on Saturday and the hotel was very conveniently located to both. Also, Norma's was excellent. We ate there on Saturday and Sunday. The food & service were both excellent. Our room was comfortable and the park view was very nice. The Burger Joint was fun for lunch as we checked out on Sunday. The hotel room was very quiet, well appointed, and comfortable. Great location for shows, shopping, or running in the park. Highly recommend for your weekend away in NYC. The hotel is fun, clean and provides everything you need for a short or long stay. I like the renovations to the lower level (former racquetball and basketball area). There is a gym, salon, juicebar and spa.\\nWhen will the construction in the area be done? The back entrance in impossible to find amongst the scaffolding. I think this hotel is the best value for the money in NYC. The size of the rooms and amenities can't be beat at this price. The only complaint I would have is that the air conditioning wasn't cold enough but it was probably average, I just like to sleep in a cold room. Stayed at the W-Downtown for one night, but my boss and I didn't like it and moved here. What a refreshing change it was at 2/3 the price. \\nService was a quantum leap above the W. Check in staff was friendly and was the concierge who knows what the best eateries were around the block. Have the say the guys were warmer than the ladies, who were professional but a little more aloof (both front desk and concierge). Bellhop was a bit of a rip-off. Only helped to bring the bags from cab to the front desk and took off after getting the tip. \\nLocation was much better. I was walking everywhere, even 10-15 blocks to TIme Sq for shows. Summer evenings are bearable, noon-time not as much. \\nRooms were average and dated. When I stayed here 9 years ago, it felt more amazing, But it was clean, unpretentious and functional. The shower was great. One complain is that there wasn't night curtains on the living room windows and was quite bright in the morning. Not easy to sleep in. \\nHave one of the largest gym I have seen ever, and has a very complete set of equipment, if not a little old. Only complain is the trainer who felt he had to come over and give me training tips even though what I really wanted was a quick 30-min in/out. Not judging how out of shape he was - just saying.\\nGreat breakfast / brunch restaurant at the lobby. A bit expensive but very good. A cheaper and great option is the Brooklyn Diner one block over as recommended by the concierge. Went there 3 times after. We stayed two nights with our son who is 4, in a junior suite. The entire experience was great. The hotel is very welcoming of children -- and the bellmen were especially entertaining. The room was the perfect layout (and very clean) and the location of the hotel in the city made it easy to get everywhere. The renovated lower level was so nice -- I had a fast manicure while my son enjoyed a juice and muffin from the Blue Dog. My husband thought the new workout facilities were top notch. Since my husband is Starwood Platinum, and there is no club floor, we enjoyed complimentary lattes and baked goods both mornings. We will definitely stay at the Parker Meridien again. We booked with Amex travelservice.\\nThey refuse to ad spg points to my account although i payed with my amex card.\\nthe explanation they give is that a third party (amex travel service) payed in my place!\\nWhatever!!! \\nIf this is such a problem to attribute points for a 4 digit number bill beginning with 2...well i'll stay at another hotel next time...mariott, sofitel...they don't make a fuss with their fidelity program!!!\\nit's a way of binding customers to your brand....well bad luck spg!!! never again!!!\\nThank the parker meridien!!!!! Okay, first, it wasn't a fat lady, but after a wonderful time, the last few moments in the hotel left me shaking my head.\\nI was coming into NYC with a well known person for a party, and because of previous experiences while out with him, I have literally had his fans toss me to the side like a rag muffin so that they could get close to him and a photo, and my experience with another well known hotel the week before where I was actually panhandled by a driver and badgered unrelentlessly, I with purpose called the Le Parker and specifically requested that we be placed in an area of the hotel that might assure us some privacy and they handled our request beautifully. \\nOur room was spacious and well appointed, we were never bothered by staff, and our request for an extra robe and towels was met quickly and with efficiency. Note to hotel- when 2 guest are checking into a room, it would be appropriate to have two robes available for each guest, especially with the fact that it was specifically requested that we truly wanted privacy. \\nThe staff upon check in were wonderful and allowed for a very quick check in with very little needed. The concierge was quick to provide an umbrella fir our use during the rain pour, and were kind enough to remember who I was when I returned the umbrella.\\nThe bar area is beautiful, as is the pools view. The decor tasteful, sleek with a very Euopean flair. Our mini bar was well stocked and the shower in the room was a treat for a physically tired body..... I had just commuted well over 33 hours in just 4 days and was a little beaten up by it all, and the shower felt like a hundred magic fingers releasing the stresses of travel.\\nEverything was perfect for us, as we have both stayed at the hotel before, and my last experience had left me with a headache, this one while there did not, and for him, it brought back a rush of memories of many a night there while in tour or seeing old friends and this trip was also proving to be an experience of fondess until our check out time.\\nWe had opted for the breakfast package where we could check out later, this giving us some time to relax before hurrying off to our next destination, which we luxuriated in. It was a wonderful treat to be able to do this..... but upon check out is when it became nasty and well turned a wonderful experience into one that fell short of what we would expect of a hotel of this level.\\nInstead if opting for the express check out we went to the front desk to do so. I had placed our incidental charges in cash and as we had not used anything, not even getting the breakfast that was part of the package, this should have been a very easy process. It was not. The woman checking me out was insolent, and quite frankly her behavior was unacceptable by all means.\\nI wasbnot rude, did not speak down to her, was not snippy, but walked away in complete frustion and with a foul taste in my mouth.\\nWhen I went to check out, I handed her my receipt for my deposit. She pulled up my info on her pc screen and asked me how I wished to pay for the reminder of my charges that I owed after she would be crediting my account with the 100 dollars for incidental charges. WHAT?????? What charges, we hadn't used anything, hadn't ordered room service, hadn't gotten the breakfast that was part of our package, had not used the minibar, had not purchased a robe, but yet she wanted me to pay an additional 299 dollars that she was stating I still owed. My mind was completely boggled now, I had pre-reserved the room, which also meant that I had put the room on my credit card and had already seen that the amount had been dedeucted from my account, how on earth could I owe another 300 dollars???? This went on and on and on... meanwhile my companion is beginning to get very restless and becoming very uncomfortable standing there as all of this is playing out.... and to top things off, we were checking out before the time we needed to as we needed to beat traffic out of the city so that he could make his next concert in an entirely different state within a few hours. \\nUpon feeling his extreme discomfort and my total frustration at the situation that was unfolding I urged him to go get the car around so that we could still try to make it out of the city in time, and I pulled out my IPad so that I could pull up my account online and show this woman that the room was already paid for. At this point she disappeared for an ungodly amount of time, leaving me unattended and nervously looking at the time that was passing. \\nWhen she finally returned she was still rude, which is when I explained that I had and have been a previous guest at this very hotel as well as the entire family if hotels that they have, which is when her tone dripped with sarcasm and actual disbelief tht I could have possibly stayed hee before. At that point I was fed up and told her that the way this was being handled was completely unacceptable on every level and if we had not been pressed for time I would have demanded to see a manager. \\nI showed her on my IPad my online banking account that indeed showed the room had already been paid for, and at that point she sulkingly returned my deposit and I left the hotel completely exasperated, frustrated and no longer with the fond memories of a night spent blissfully but now only concerned about my companion making his previously booked engagement and apologetic that he had to stand there in the lobby while all of this transpired.\\nAfter my last two experiences with this hotel I am truly questioning if I would indeed be a guest at this hotel again, the only saving grace may be the location and the pool and the performance of the other staff during my stay. Housekeepers were great. Room was great. Don't expect a lot of help or personality from the rest of the staff. Minibar fridge was not working, nor was the toilet. However, they fixed toilet quickly and efficiently, and provided a small fridge at no cost. I guess I was expecting more. When a concierge tells you there aren't many places to dine after 9:00 on a Sunday in New York, and that you could try looking online for Broadway tickets, you know the service is very poor. Sometimes a little service or a recommendation makes all the difference even if you are quite proficient in finding your own tickets and reservations. Dopey decor. Really great bellmen and location. We are back to the W, Waldorf or Fairmont next trip. We very much enjoyed our stay. The location is perfect, the rooms were clean as well as the entire hotel. I highly recommend this property. It's a great value too! Vivvian at the front desk was exceptional. Check out the \"burger place\" down teh hallway behind the front desk. We'll definitly book again. Excellent location, very close to the real heart of Manhattan. Extraordinary view of Central park from certain rooms: I actually enjoyed that.\\nProfessional service. Good solution for family vacation (as in my case) but also for business stays...and regretfully my business does not usually take me to NYC. For midtown hotels, Le Parker Meridien satisfies my usual requirements when traveling for business. I'm not crazy about the gym that you have to pay to use, BUT Central Park is close enough and jogging early in the morning in the park is 'ze best way to start a tiger lady's day. I also like being near Columbus Circle. Yeah, the restaurants are tasty (but pricey) BUT Whole Foods is the best way to end a day... salad bar, yo. This is a wonder to behold in and of itself. Not to mention the J Crew and Sephora for last minute clothing and beauty needs. The hotel is clean, the staff VERY friendly, the Starbucks across the street is among some of the slower services I've seen (go two blocks south or east and you'll find faster ones), but the Burger Bar is the late night, I'm-so-hungry place to grab a tasty meal.. only to run off the calories in the morning! The bar at the hotel is very lovely.. a great meeting place for a cocktail with a client. Oh, the keys are ridiculously large and you have to check it at the front desk if you want to run hands free. It's weird. But its orange so its kind of cool, I guess. I stayed in the hotel for a long weekend of shopping with my wife. I choose it because it was recommended on expedia and seemed to have a good price and location.\\nOverall, a pretty good hotel, a nice bar and rooms. It has a gym on the lower ground floor, but seemed to be part of an external chain and wasn't open when I wanted to use it.\\nNot a really cosy hotel as the lobby is wide and the receptions is a little to the side and discreet. It has a cool burger bar in the lobby but is small and packed.\\nOverall, if you are looking for a reliable quality place in a good location, then I would stay here. Due to my business i choose this hotel and i am totally satisfied with the location.Everything is done in 1 day and hotel get the credit due to the location.Thanks for staff also for the amenity sent to my room.\\nJ We stayed here 3 years ago and it was awesome, so I had high expectations for our recent trip. The hotel and service exceeded all my expectations and has even improved in the new spa facilities. This hotel is perfect for families, as they have a rooftop pool, junior suites that are partitioned with sofa sleepers and a day bed on one side, and king bed on the other, The Burger Joint in the lobby, and even cartoons playing on the elevator TVs! Icing on the cake for us was the razor scooters for the kids to ride in Central Park. The location can't be beat, and the service is incredible. I highly recommend Le Parker Meridien for any traveler who is looking for a comfortable stay in a great location at the right price! I stay here solely because my office is on 125 west 56th street- that's literally across the street, doesnt get any closer than that.\\nelevators are slow, you'll find that you will need to wait for the elevator at the lobby and when you are trying to come down. i was on the 19th floor. \\nPrice is not cheap, again I stay here for work, i wouldnt actually pay face value for a personal trip as i found the rooms to be old and small. i dont like how the shower head does not have a removable shower head, the water pressure is low. the cleanliness is great, housekpeeping are very considerate, change soap bars every other day. \\nlocation is a big plus, a block away from 5th avenue and right next to 6/7. \\ndont really have much else to say, i feel the hotel is pretty neutral, nothing great, nothing horrible, but at prices north of $350/nt for a basic room, i do expect more.\\nfood is not cheap, room service, etc - eating at norma's is expensive and three is always a wait. \\ni like how they have nice 55\" led tvs in the room, but the selection of channels is not great, i expected more espn channels, there was only 1. Was a really nice hotel in a good location. The hotel is expensive to stay but we got a good price through a package deal. My husband and I were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary with a trip to NYC and this hotel was close to walk to all the main attractions we wanted to see. The bathroom was quite small but was clean. Room was nice, again not overly big but this is typical of NYC hotels. The front desk staff were ok, not the most friendly people I've met! All in all it was great for our first visit. Would stay here again if on a deal but wouldn't pay the regular price. I've stayed in many hotels in NYC, and this was the first that didn't actually resemble a NYC hotel room (i.e. a tiny, dirty shoebox). The staff was great, room was beautiful (great technologies in it as well), and the property is in a great location. My only qualms with it were the meal I ordered ($41 for a bowl of really bad mac and cheese) and the fact that the hair dryers in the room are from the 80's and pop out of the wall. Even the Holiday Inn has blow dryers with nozzle attachments and multiple speeds, and since I don't travel with a blow dryer, I was pretty unhappy about that. What made it worse was that they make a point of placing a sign in the bathroom announcing that there's a blow dry bar on the premises, but since I was in town for work and couldn't wait for it to open (nor did I want to pay $50 for something I can do myself in 20 minutes), I wasn't able to do my hair. Not a great way to head into a meeting. All in all, I loved it and will stay again, I'll just be sure to bring a blow dryer and purchase food from the outside. My husband & I travelled to NYC for a 3 night stay in July. On our first night we stayed at a hotel in Soho. It was so noisy we barely slept. We moved to Le Parker Meridien in Midtown because we hoped it would be quieter. It was and we were very happy with our stay. Andrew at the front desk was great and gave us a room on the 35th with a great view of central park. Claudia in the Concierge got a reservation at OTTO where we had a great dinner. Wonderful trip and great stay at this hotel. The perfect place to unwind after a busy day of touring NYC! Would definitely stay here again. This delightful hotel is always fresh, clean, yet makes you feel at home...but maybe that is the Orange washcloths.\\nThis stay I decided to test out the hidden Burger Joint located in what used to be the bar when I first started staying there. What a delight...had a great burger and glass of beer for $15 and then went to the bar in the lobby and had a Lemon Drop Martini for the same price--ahh New York!\\nVisit this hotel--you will love it! I made reservations, for my sister's birthday present, by phone. Agent was friendly, seemed very knowledgeable. She said this was a great gift and that maybe the hotel would do something special for her birthday. Room was put on my credit card. When my sister and her husband arrived, she was told that she needed to produce the credit card on which the reservations were initially made. Obviously, she did not have my credit card. They could not procede with the check-in until they canceled the charges on my card and billed her card. I was irate to say the least. I spoke to credit department and unless I stood on my head and jumped through hoops, the charges would stay on my sister's card. Also, the room with the beautiful view that I was promised by the friendly agent turned out to be a dud. A room with a view of construction ONLY. Nothing but a large green wall and construction workers. NO OTHER VIEW. Hotel was \"booked\" so they couldn't move my sister and her husband. Spoke with desk clerks, hotel manager, credit agent, credit manager and NO ONE was helpful. I just got fowarded from one person to the next. Never, never again. Please think twice before booking here. Great location, clean, funky rooms, super-friendly, helpful staff, fabulous bar and Norma's. You couldn't ask for anything more!\\nI have never had a better sleep in a hotel in my life thanks to the comfortable beds and quiet room. Great stay, clean rooms and friendly staff. Norma's for breakfast is a MUST! Check in was a little slow due to a computer issue but Alex at the front desk was wonderful. Location was perfect- close to Central Park, Nobu 57 where we had dinner and shopping. Did not get a chance to use the Spa on this trip but will definitely return to check it out. Traveled to NYC with family over a long weekend. Stayed at Le Parker Meridien. This is a big, fancy hotel. I'm not used to such luxuries, usually staying at the cheapest places I can find. That being said, I was surprised how smallish the rooms are. Internet costs 14.99 a day. The pool closes early. And the mini bar will cost you a lot. The televisions are very nice and the bed was extremely comfortable. Arrived late on Saturday Afternoon, Noticed building site directly outside our window,23rd floor not too impressed, no warning given when we booked, View of the park extreamly restricted. Out all day Sunday so not that bothered. Awakened early Monday by start up of building work, This was bad enough the real shock was the 50 to 60 guys in hard hats not fifty feet from our window.No draw curtains on the window, only thin nets. It was like living in a gold fish bowl. Not what you expexct from a 5 star hotel. Called the desk and the initial attitude was \" what do you want us to do about it.\" no rooms available\". After working my way up the management chain a room miraculously appeared on the opposite side of the hotel. So we packed up and moved but this disrupted our day. Another problem was no control over the air conditioning. As a warning to anyone else, If you are staying here in the near future check the room before you unpack Needless to say we will not be back.\\n SPG Gold.member The Le Parker Meridian is the best hotel to stay at with or without children. The rooms are clean and updated. What is better then cartoons in the lift. The food in the hotel is the best with the Hamburger joint right in the lobby. If you can stand the snobby waiters and poor service at Norma's its worth it because the food is to die for. The roof top pool and the great gym is also a plus. Love this Hotel it is the only place I stay in New York. For my wife's big 30th birthday, I rented a jr suite for her and her friends. The hotel staff, from front desk woman to bell men to spa people, was fantastic. Room was beautiful and extremely well-designed. Our stay was simply perfect. Friendly staff, especially Lawrence at the front desk was welcoming and fast. Clean rooms, amazing pool and central location to family friendly NYC locations like central park and fao schwarz. Fast service to get beds turned down. Loved the Tom & Jerry cartoons and Charlie Chaplin films in the elevator! Will be back! For the most part, we had no complaints. We enjoyed the complementary continental breakfast (lattes and a choice of croissants) in the cafe/bar area and found the staff there very pleasant. The staff at check-in were less welcoming but it's very crowded there, with lots of people coming and going, so I don't want to be overly critical. They were pleasant when we checked out, when it was considerably less crowded and noisy. We find the location is very convenient and our room was fine. We certainly would come again and have been here several times before. This was our first stay at Le Parker Meridien but will not be the last. We came to NYC for the weekend to celebrate my mother's birthday.From the moment we walked into the lobby, the staff at Le Parker Meridien Hotel made us feel very welcome. When they heard it was my mother's birthday, their fabulous guest relations manager, Majda, made sure my mother had a room with a view and even sent some birthday treats to her room. The warm staff, beautiful rooms, and view of central park made this birthday weekend one to remember. Thank you, Majda!! This hotel is located near the center of the world’s most energetic city but, because it is on the edge of an upscale residential neighborhood near Central Park, it offers a quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. By no means do I wish to insinuate that this place is away from it all, far from it. This hotel is located within walking distance of many of the cities greatest attractions as well as some of the best museums, theaters and restaurants the city has to offer. Its close proximity to Central Park and between two of the city’s main thoroughfares (5th and 8th Avenue) makes this location perfect if you want to feel what it might be like to live in the heart of Manhattan. As for the hotel itself, it has everything you expect from the Le Meridien brand. It’s the blending old world and modern that is the signature of many of their best properties. The rooms are modern and well appointed. Don't miss the roof top pool, coffee in their magnificent lobby bar and ask for a room facing north on one of the higher floors for spectacular views of Central Park. I rate this hotel 4.5 out of 6 stars. Fantastic location, great staff, great restaurants (we usually want to try new restuarants every day but were thrilled to go to Norma's every single morning for breakfast), great room, our kids loved it, and really nice to have the pool -- though waiving the $15 daily fee for hotel guests would be a nice touch. Great location, staff very helpful.\\nExpensive drinks and food.\\nRoom ok, small bathroom. View great on 42nd Floor facing Central Park.\\nUs Brits like our tea and coffee in our room, sadly this was not the case so missed our cuppa, also no trouser press.\\nAll in All I recommend this hotel. My daughter and I spent a pleasant weekend in NY, aided in many ways by the Parker Meridian team. The hotel is sleek and contemporary, especially the room and bathroom, although the hallway on our floor was a little worn. The staff was quite helpful in recommending restaurants, transportation, and even suggested a place to jog. The pool facility, which was a major attraction for us, was lovely although in the end we didn't swim. Location was excellent, within walking distance of Central Park, Times Square and Broadway, and midtown East and West. It was a decent value for a NY hotel. I would definitely return and also recommend it. Great location, very friendly and welcoming staff. nice room, nice pool. Great place to visit with a young child! Just returned from a long weekend in NYC. My daughter and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien. The location was perfect, the room was immaculate (each day) and the front desk staff was extremely helpful and accommodating. The nightly room rate was more than reasonable for the value we received. We would stay here again ... and again. This hotel is in a perfect location, a few minutes walk from central park, several subway lines nearby, and only about 10 mins walk to Times Square.\\nI paid extra charge for a 'Park View' room, only to find a large crane in the centre of my view outside my window during my stay (no warning or mention of this by staff at check in desk!). Building work which was about 10 floors below my 33rd floor room and started before 7am each morning, (on the positive side it helped me to be up and out enjoying NY early!) They built 2 floors during my 7 day stay....so I wonder how much longer the view will be there for? Also a very tall thin building opposite, to the left of my room, had just gone up, not very attractive concrete with orange mesh around it, still internal building going on, so more noise! The view was still good - straight ahead beyond the crane, my room was lovely, clean and spacious, and as i was out most of the day building work didn't really spoil my stay too much, but if you are looking for a lie in - don't stay here! \\nThe most annoying thing about the hotel were the charges for the use of the pool $10 (or $15 for two in a room) a day, and also the same charge for use of the sun deck to sunbathe, I can't believe they charge this on top of high room prices, most disappointing since this was the reason i chose this hotel over others nearby, and there was no mention of this charge in any of the hotel information at the time of booking. There is also another $15 charge for use of the gym. Thankfully Central Park was so close and free!\\nI don't think this is a very 'tourist friendly' hotel - there was not a shred of information in the rooms about the City/area, or even about anything in the hotel (eg pool, gym, room service etc), for that matter! No kettle (I had read the reviews and took a travel one) and no fridge - but there was an ice machine down the corridor, which they don't charge for - yet. Generally the hotel seemed to be more geared to buisness/conference guests or people with so much money they didn't need to think about the cost of anything in advance!\\nCertainly a nice hotel.....but not sure if i would recommend it, even when the building work is over, because of all the hidden charges. First let me start by saying that this was the first visit to NY! We selected the Meridien based on feedback from a friend. Andrew at the front desk was great! he had a great attitude about him and was very helpful. The rooms were just as expected....very clean and cozy. I would recomend this hotel to anyone! Looking forwad to my next visit, and for sure will stay st the Parker again! Thanks for a great experience! This is an overpriced hotel, but what isn't in Midtown?\\nThe rooms have a scandinavian decor that is to my estimate at least 25 years old and in need of complete renovation. Stained rugs, patched ceilings, old TV set, worn counch, you name it. I stayed in a junior suite with the shower big enough to hold six people but there is no bathtub, and not a single hook or towel rack large enough to hang anything larger than a face towel.\\nThe best thing i can say is the staff are very nice. Central location. Calm and quiet. Helpful, courteous, knowledgeable personell. Clean room, very well appointed. Very comfortable bed. Loved every minute Stayed here for 7 nights with my daughter. Hotel was comfortable and clean, staff wonderfully friendly and when I had a problem with the air conditioning someone came and sorted it within 10 minutes! Room service prompt and good. We loved the pool & sun deck and had a couple of meals up there. The location is superb - 20 mins from Times Square & Rockafella Centre, 2 blocks from 5th Avenue shopping and Central Park - lots of supermarkets, eating & drinking places and feels very safe. Would definitely recommend for a 1st trip to NYC! I've stayed at many, many hotels in NYC. Not only was this hotel super clean, the rooms were very spacious and comfortable. And despite the construction across the street, it was pretty quiet, as well. We were traveling with our baby and it was just perfect. Stayed there for a week-long NYC vacation with the family (including 2 boys 6 and 11). Place is very kid friendly and the location can't be beat.\\nThe Knave bar was very nice for some late night drinks. Norma's was OK but it is too fancy for kids. There is a Dean& DeLuca practically across the street which was very nice for breakfast, although there are also many other choices up 7th Avenue.\\nIt was a little noisy at night (it is NYC after all) and the bed quality wasn't the best, but everything was very clean and fresh, which is not always the case at NYC unless you're willing to pay big money. checking in lacked continuity,in terms of one receptionist checking us in and the extremely arrogant Edwin denying we were checked in and implying were were not even booked, despite me spelling my name twice. he eventually agreed we were checked in but changed my wifes' name.He handed us our keys with a rude and patronising comment that ruined the start of what we hoped was to be dream holiday.\\nWe found his attitude dreadful. Although the hotel is to be commended generally, our perceptions were shaped by this initial very poor experience. It is all about location, location, location and the Parker Meridian is the perfect location for a NYC trip. It is close to everything. The Parker is a good, classy hotel. Attractive building, smart and well-kept rooms, that has somehow managed to avoid the reverse facelift and smudgy purple-blue lighting of so many Meridiens that now look like seedy small-town nightclubs.\\nService is OK - not stellar, but adequate for New York.\\nThe bar is very nice. This hotel is at two blocks for central park and some blocks to Times Square, so it´s the besto option to stay. The rooms are very confortable (big), the bathroom is a little small, but is find, is very clean everything. The people from front desk it´s very kind, also de concierge. And these hotel has the best burgers in New York at the lobby, the space is small and most of times you have to make a line that goes fast. I´ve been in many hotels in these city and It´s the best option to stay at New York Le Parker Meridien We stayed at the Parker Meridian during one of the hottest spells of the summer and it was very comfortable and yes the air conditioning worked. However, what they are not telling everyone is there is major construction on this site and the cranes start at 8am. This was a major noise issue in addition to the already noisy NYC streets. I found the room and bed very comfortable and I liked the shower, but they could improve on the amenities and at a minium have free water. There was no wi fi in the rooms. I really like the location of this hotel next to my favorites, Stage Deli and Rothmans Steak house on 54th and Madison. It is very close to the park and I found the staff very friendly and the security was excellent. I would stay away from this hotel until the construction is finished or demand a room away from. My fiance had a big event there the week we stayed and I was really surprised that they put us next to the construction and did a minimal room discount after her company had spent so much on their investor day. No bueno in my view. I recently traveled to NYC for business and spent 4 nights here. This was actually the second time I had stayed at this hotel, so I knew all about it already. As most of the other reviews have indicated, the location is unbeatable. I was able to walk wherever I needed to go - both for business meetings, and for dinning out at the huge assortment of great mid-town restaurants in Manhattan. The lobby is simple, subdued but modern in design. The hotel has a very unique burger bar off the lobby (behind a curtain). And there is a breakfast only cafe. There is also a bar. The atmosphere was very 'hip' but not pretentious. The place does have a unique personality. There are TV monitors in the elevators that show old black & white movies and classic jazz performances. The room I stayed in was a junior or mini-suite. It had a nice sitting area with couch, coffee table, a built in bench under the big window, a desk with a nice Aeron chair for working and a TV set in a swiveling cabinet. The cabinet can be rotated so the TV can face the sitting area or the bedroom area. My room was on the street side of the hotel (facing south - 56th St.) and I was on the 17th floor, so there was no view to speak of, since the buildings across the way and surrounding are much taller. My understanding is that you need to be on a higher floor (although the elevator only indicated 22 floors) in order to have a view, and you need to be on the north side. The room was modern and comfortable. Spacious enough that you could spread out. The bed was a very comfortable king. The last time I stayed here, the first room they gave me was near the elevator, which was noisy, so I requested a room away from the elevators this time around. I found the valet staff, bell staff, front desk personnel and the concierge to be very friendly and warm. For travelers away from home, that kind of service is always important. I will be back to NYC on business again this year, and intend to stay here again as well. First ever trip to New York was made so much easier by staying at this hotel, it is close to all the major shops, Central Park and Times Square.\\nThe room was spacious and bright, air conditioning was used 24/7 as it was 95 degrees during the day and 85 degrees during the night and being British we were not used to these sort of temperatures!\\nBathroom was spot on, nice big mirror and will lit, shower was lovely but a hand held attachment would have been nice.\\nThe desk chair was asbolutely fabulous, having a bad back from all the walking and sightseeing and then sitting down in this chair was such a relief :)\\nStaff were very helpful and many thanks to Lourdes on the cleaning crew who left us a personal message wishing me and the wife a happy anniversary, this sort of personal touch was welcome.\\nThe TV could ahve done with on demand films/tv but it was more than big enough though.\\nThe reception staff and concierge staff were first class every time.\\nThe Burger Joint sell the best burgers ever and Normas comes a very close second.\\nWould recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone Stayed for a week and loved the food at Normas and the burger joint. Also loved the location is to die for. The room was large but the bathroom is tiny. We had a view of central park. Fantastic. Stayed here on business in June for a week. Perfectly located for the shops on 5th avenue and central park. The check in was super swift which was great but the service experience thereafter was poor. Got woken up twice by the laundry service calling who were asking questions about my cleaning and the maid service did not clean my room to 5 star standards and my shampoo disappeared. we really enjoyed the parker meridian. It has a cool, funky atmosphere yet is great for families. Located just north of times square, south of central park and west of 5th avenue, it gives you great access to many of the tourist spots. My wife and I booked via a conference agency, to stay for 8 days June-July 2012.\\nWe visit New York approximately every 2 years for work, pleasure and to meet with family and friends.\\nWe requested a refrigerator and a non-smoking room. We were not warned of the absence of what, in retrospect, we would expect as standard guest facilities.\\nAt check-in, we were not given any information regarding the functioning of the hotel, there was no room guide, we were warned (by the bell-hop) not to move the contents of the in-house beverage cooler as removal of any item, even if replaced, would be automatically added to our account. We were told that a refrigerator had been supplied. This was placed in the middle the wall of the room.\\nWe were not warned that our \"Central Park\" view room also had a full view of the skyscraper height crane immediately outside our window, which operated from 6.30am-3pm except Sunday. The rooms do not have adequate sound proofing to block the continuous noise from the crane motor. It is true we were offered a room on the other side after complaining about not being warned at check-in, but re-packing is no small task and my wife declined. There appears to be no customer relations response, as there was no contact made to see how we were faring. There was no mention of staff assistance with any proposed move. At least the crane did not work at night.\\nThe room was adequate without being luxurious, the fittings reasonable, the bed and pillows comfortable cleaning service timely and good. The toiletries are average. The window blinds do not provide sufficient black-out and daylight intrudes even earlier than building activities.\\nClothes storage space is sub-optimal for more than one person. The room safe is awkward to access if there are objects inside the closet. The TV is large, flat screen and HD but seems to offer only limited cable TV without an apparent menu of other entertainment available. Fortunately this is New York, so we were not dependent on the in-room entertainment system and its limitations.\\nThe absolute absence of any added features e.g. in-room coffee making facility, news-paper delivery without cost, $10/person daily charge for gym use (I paid and attended the excellent spin classes on 3 occasions) , $15/person daily charge for pool use, $17.50 for internet use (ironically free to passers-by in the lobby who are not in other ways contributing to the costs of running the facility) , not to mention the absence of included breakfast of any sort, was disappointing when compared with our previous experience with Le Meridien properties. In our opinion, it marks the establishment as having a management which judges its clientele as exploitable. For example, additional services for laundry were, risibly, well above those of the local laundry about 100 metres away, the quote for a car to return to JFK 4 times higher than publically advertised car services or hailed taxicabs. \\nThe experience has resulted in a decision never to use the property again and to caution friends and relatives visiting the area, to seek alternatives where some of the additional services such as internet are provided in the basic tariff.\\nAs the hotel had already been paid for, via the conference agent (the conference rate being the same as is available on the web-site to any member of the public), there was really no redress for any of these issues. However, at check-out, I was presented with an account which included a $40 daily charge for the refrigerator, totalling $320 for an $80 item! I explained to the staff member that I had been told it would be $11 daily. She needed to leave the desk to see her manager to deal with this. Given our previously articulated dissatisfaction with the room noise and absence of additional services, this particular issue confirmed our assessment of the property and its management policies in relation to its clients and since the tariff is about the same as for many other properties in the area, a review of the cost-benefits of the current guest facility policies might be considered. The location is midtown and it is near Central Park and very close to Times square and all the touristy stuff your little heart might desire to see. I loved being able to walk to the MoMA and Central Park. It was also a lovely walk to all of the 5th avenue shops as well.\\nThe hotel appears to be in a state of renovation of some kind. Our first room was totally modern and upgraded. I loved our lovely view of Central Park. Unfortunately we were unable to stay in our room the second night because someone had rented out our whole floor. We were then moved to the exact same room a few floors up. Unfortunately that room was not upgraded and I did not like it nor did I want to stay in it. However, when we complained to the front desk they were super-helpful and moved us. We ended up getting upgraded to a junior suite, which was nice. I appreciated the effort that the front desk put into making our family happy.\\nFrom other reviews people seem really annoyed about having to pay for the gym and the pool. It's $10 and you're already paying a lot for a hotel room so... Also you can pay $15 for a gym/pool combo per room. That is seriously not a lot of money, and the pool has a beautiful view of the park. The basement of this hotel is also seriously cool. It has a spa, a blow dry bar, nail salon and a coffee shop. Best little underground cluster ever.\\nLast but not least, it also has a cool bar and of course Norma's restaurant. Room service was also quite tasty.\\nStay here if you are looking for a nice hotel in Midtown :) We just completed a weekend stay at Le Parker Meridien and EVERYTHING was excellent. I was astounded when Priceline gave us this extraordinary hotel for what was, in New York City terms, a fairly measly bid. Then I read reviews about construction noise, etc., and arrived mildly anxious.\\nTurns out the experience was exceptional in every way. No street noise whatsoever. Frigid air conditioning with near-100 degree temps outside. A friendly and courteous staff. Of course, a location to die for. An ultra-spacious room far exceeding our expectations. We have stayed at the nearby Hilton several times, this was a much better experience.\\nI hesitated to write this review because it would result in higher Priceline bids in the future. Oh well, honesty has its price. My wife and I stayed here for a quick 1 night getaway in December 2011. We also stayed here the previous December as well. Both of our stays were very nice. We had a very nice modern park view room. The location is perfect, we walked to the tree at Rockefeller center during the day and then walked to Lincoln center at night. You are in the middle of Manhattan so there are obviously good restaurants everywhere around you. We had lunch at Bar Americain and dinner at Rosa Mexicano, both were very good. Previously we had eaten at Burger Joint which is in the hotel (fast food) and is real good as well. We loved the Le Parker Meridien. The conceirge staff were all very helpful as we were new to the city. It is conveniently located to Rockafeller Center, the Yellow and Blue lines on the subway, Central Park, numerous restaurants and walk-in deli markets. The coffee in the bar downstairs is amazing and our boys both enjoyed haircuts in the vintage looking barber shop in the lobby area. The rooms were spacious enough, but the beds were only double beds, not queen size. Nicely decorated, but queen beds would've been better. Very popular breakfast/brunch restaurant and a separate popular burger restaurant downstairs as well if you don't want to venture out. Nice place! Very Nice 4 star hotel, the bar, gym, spa are 5 star but comes at a price. We had Sunday brunch at Normas...Great Burger just off the Lobby... really cool bar.... breath taking view of the city from the roof top pool. We will be back. My sister and I spent three nights here in late June. We were in NYC to see a show and the Meridien's location was perfect. Right around the corner from Time Square, the Theater District and Central Park. We were able to walk to just about everything we wanted to see. Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. A beautiful lobby, the beds were comfortable and the room was scrupulously clean. The wine at the cocktail lounge was overpriced (it was actually cheaper to drink the wine in the minibar) but the wait staff was awesome and they do capuccino right, so I was happy. The only complaints are that the charges for WiFi and for the use of the pool are exorbitant. WiFi should be complimentary these days and so should the pool, but if you must charge, make it reasonable. I will definitely stay at the Meridien when I go back with my husband. The first time I came here was ten years ago. Returned not to be disappointed. Certainly there have been changes, but none that interferred with a comfortable and pleasant stay. I was pleasantly surprised. Fairly large sized room for NYC, was able to fit the whole family in a double with the fold out couch. Went to the pool on the top for the kids and since it was during a snow storm, was pretty cool to watch the snow fall while they were swimming. Also used the gym and had a nice work out. Starbucks across the street, diners on every corner and Central Park around the corner. Plus if we really had a desire to get to time square, a quick walk down a few blocks. Quite enjoyed. had a great experience at the Parker. Right next to central park, Times Square, Rockefeller center, and all the legal offices in Manhattan. Lots of great food and entertainment places within a short walk. Fun bar at night and great breakfast options right in the hotel. Had an amazing time. They catered to our needs.. Very helpful. Was there for our 25th wedding anniversary and had a great time. The poll also has one of the best views of central park. I stayed here for a night on business as I continued to try new hotels in the NYC area. Upon check in I was immediately upgraded to a suite. The room was extremely comfortable. The furnishings could use some updating as they are extremely dated (tube televisions, old sofa and bed), but still the room was clean and spacious. Especially compared to rooms at the W and other hotels in the area, the room was extremely large. If you are looking for a normal hotel experience versus the \"shoebox: new york hotel this hotel did not disappoint.\\nThe lobby is large and very grand which creates a different feel then other hotels. That being said hotel gets a lot of traffic which makes it feel like more of a tourist hotel then one for business travelers, but it did not detract from the stay.\\nThe gym was probably one of the largest I have seen of any hotel in the area. That being said it was kind of weird that you have to sign and authorize payment, but for the size and options its worth the $10. For SPG platinum members that fee is waived which is even more of a bargain.\\nI would recommend this hotel for others, especially if you prefer space. We had a staycation and spent a night at the Parker Meridien. As an SPG gold member, I was granted an upgrade to a room \"with a great view of Central Park\". All we saw was the massive crane doing construction on the building next door. Kind of a let down. Service was very good, otherwise. Room was spacious (compared to other NYC hotels we've stayed in) and very comfortable. great location for museums and theatre, loved having Starbucks and Dean and Deluca across street. Would have liked little Cafe for before or after theatre snacks. I atayed at this hotel for 4 nights this June with my daughter and friends on a site seeing trip. The hotel was mostly filled with business people. As mentioned by previous reviewers it is a perfect location for Times Sqaure, Fifth Avenue (Aberrombie is on corner of the block, Central Park and mueums. The hotel itself is reasonable for its price and I chose it as we are SPG members. Our King room on 26th floor was nicely appointed with flat screen TV and was in good order, huge desk at window and great view over central park two blocks away. As mentioned by previous reviewers the bathrooms are small but the room was larger than expected for NY. Bed was comfortable with lots of pillows.\\nWe didn't eat in the restaurant for breakfast as we were told we would have to book but there are diners and Starbucks on every street around the hotel so this was no problem adn much cheaper. The Burger Joint is very good but not at all waht we expected in a hotel, you queue at the counter to order and your burger is paper wrapped like a take away but cooked perfectly and full of lfavour, recommended. There is a pleasant but unusual bar area where we had drinlks one evening, its very Spanish in style and service was good.\\nWe didn't find the staff friendly on reception but they were efficient, I would stay here again and would recommend it. This hotel is perfectly located in NYC. It is blocks from Times Square, 2 blocks from Central Park and 2 blocks from the fab shops of Fifth Avenue. The hotel itself is modern and clean and reasonably well appointed. The standard king room comes with a nice sized flat screen TV and a comfortable desk area. My complaints about the room are a) There is no dresser in the room, so drawer space is extremely limited; b) Too few hangers in the closet (fixed with a simple phone call to the desk); c) The bathroom is a bit small for the price point - at least compared to other cities; d) the thermostat can only be controlled by the front desk (how about training your housekeeping staff to reset the room temp when they clean, instead of forcing the guest to contact the desk to change the temp??) Otherwise, the staff are extremely friendly, the hotel restaurant, Norma's, delicious and the lounge nicely appointed. If you're looking for a nice, reasonably priced (by NYC standards) hotel with a great location, this is it. I've never been to this hotel before but I do travel a lot and stay in Hotels for my work.\\nI can say that this is one of the best I have stayed in and the Staff,the rooms ,location and the ambience did not let me down.\\nNo leaky showers ,No cables hanging as mentioned elswhere and I look for this stuff much to my Wifes annoyance. I inspect the safety of electrical installations for a living so it's always a Busmans holiday. The place has a good vibe with cheeky humor. Huge desks (along the window) make it a fantastic option for business travelers; the restaurant Norma has deservedly an excellent reputation for unusual breakfast options (think red fruit risotto and artichoke eggs benedict with truffle porcini sauce) - but its popularity means that esp. on weekends you may not get a table without reservation. The commercial gym in the basement is very nice but the $10 usage charge per visit was unexpected. Bathrooms are OKish - not big, shower tub for shower, no shower gel. The location of this hotel is great. True, it looks like a construction site at the moment, and you should enter off 56th St not 57th St to avoid this. The room was a bit worn down and could use a freshening, but it was clean and spacious. Not the best hotel in NY by any means, but very adequate. Beware: wi-fi costs a lot of money at this place. We have stayed at this hotel probably at least 10 times. It is very convenient to a great number of \\nNyc attractions . We have stayed at some of the cities other fine hotels before , but continue to\\nReturn here. We have stayed at this hotel many times in the past and used to really enjoy it. It has been a couple years, but remembering it as a fun and cool place to stay, we decided to stay there this past weekend. The location is great, but the hotel itself was really disappointing. As Starwood Gold members, we were upgraded to a high-floor room overlooking Central Park. The view was great, but the room was very tired and dated. The hotel rooms are in serious need of renovations. The bedspread was stained (I just pulled it off and left it on the floor the entire time), the walls were very scuffed (I am not the type to \"look for\" stuff like this, but it was very noticeable) and the swiveling console that houses the tube television (no flat screen) ate up so much of the space in the room we had to negotiate ourselves around it. The decor is really starting to look tired. Even the bed, which is usually a selling point to Starwood properties, was pretty uncomfortable. I thought it was just me until my husband commented how uncomfortable it was. Having spent a fair amount of time in NYC hotels, I know not to expect huge rooms and bathrooms, however our bathroom was so tight that the bathroom door just about grazed the toilet and sink as I was closing it. Getting in the bathroom and closing the door required maneuvering yourself around the sink and toilet. I'm a small person and I could barely function in it. Even the lobby, which used to be fun and hip, was lackluster (although \"The Burger Joint\" is still a great place to grab great burgers and fries). When my husband and I went to use the pool we were told there was a $10 fee per person, per day to use it. There was no mention of that fee anywhere on the website or paperwork we received. We used to enjoy staying at this hotel, but will probably not be staying there again in the future. Our visit to Le Parker Meridien was again, great. The hotel and rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable. Just wish the pool wasn't an additional charge. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room service food was excellent. Concierge dinner recommentations were very good. The beds were comfortable. Very good balance of value and service for NYC. Only downside was elevator wait at a peak time on one day of my stay. We recently stayed at the Parker Meridien after having not stayed there since it became part of the Westin chain. The hotel has really been upgraded and the accomodations were excellent, much better than when it was an independent hotel. We would heartily recommend this hotel. As a SPG Platinum, I really appreciate the warm welcome and room upgrade that I received at this mid-town hotel. They have an impressive attention detail, with systems that allow them to remember my favorite newspaper and other preferences. The burger joint is consistently wonderful and the concierge staff knowledgeable. Another great stay at the Parker Meridien. Well run, comfortable, and convenient. Solid and dependable! First class service from check in to check out. Very nice rooms, bar is outstanding with Teresa running the show. One thing you might want to avoid is breakfast at the restaraunt, HUGE portions and it takes a bit longer even though the service is really good. If they offered a smaller quick service option it would have improved the overall experience. I had a great stay at the Le Parker Meridien. The room was actually a suite (don't know if all are), with nice furniture and lovely wood detailing. Good shower, not great. Bed was very, very comfortable. As far as I'm concerned, though, what makes this place special is the penthouse pool, with amazing views of Central Park. The pool is open long hours, has a sundeck, and you can order food, which is just great. I didn't check out the gym, but I hear its pretty great, too. A few minor gripes:\\n(1) Get HDTVs in all rooms, please\\n(2) I couldn't access the wifi network in the lobby\\n(3) The restaurant should open for breakfast before 7am.\\nWhen all is said and done, the positives far outweigh the negatives, and when you consider the price (I paid $450, which in midtown Manhattan is rare), this place is a freaking home run, a much more luxurious option than similarly-priced options like Sheraton, Hilton, or Doubletree. Pros: Good location with entrances on both sides of the hotel and located across the street from a Starbucks. Plenty of restaurants and Central Park within walking distance. Service was good helping me resolve billing issues. Beds and noise level were fine as well. \\nCons: To turn down the blinds in the room we had to jump on the desk to reach the cord. Don't move anything in the mini bar or they will charge you. The burger place downstairs was overhyped as well. Pricey and bland. My husband and I made a joke that they were happy meals. They accept cash only, no credit cards. \\nOverall it's ok. Nothing that was horrible but nothing that was awesome either. I'd like to check out other hotels in NYC when I return. We had a wonderful experience, with attentive service, and staff that went above and beyond. The hotel is extremely well located, within walking distance to Broadway, find restaurants, a bus tour stop, and the subway. The room was large and very clean, with a magnificent view of Central Park. Although construction noise could be heard from rooms closer to street level, on the 35th floor, it was very quiet. The manager had beautiful desserts sent up to our room when she learned it was both mine and my daughter's birthday. It was a thoughtful touch. I recommend you don't eat at Norma's for breakfast- the prices are astronomical ($9 for a glass of juice, $25 for an omelette), and the food is nothing special. The only thing lacking is the gym, which is large and well outfitted, but is in the basement which is dark and cave-like. But with all of New York to explore by foot, who needs a gym?! I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for three nights enjoyed it very much. I have been visiting once per year for the past ten years and I look forward to spending my time there each year. If I hadn't met Maurice the Bellman at my arrival and then again during my departure, the hotel might not get the rave reviews for friendliness, although other staff were polite and professional, Maurice is the ambassador with the golden touch for Le Parker. I was concerned booking this hotel because my 2.5 year old daughter was travelling with us. From the moment I stepped out of my car, Maurice was there assisting and caring for us. He really was remarkable (and understanding of what it's like to travel with a child) which made the check-in experience happy and welcoming. He connected with my daughter and had her laughing and cheerfully distracted after a long car ride. Amazing! I wish I could replicate it.\\nThe room was comfortable and spacious (for a NYC hotel), and we had outstanding views of Central Park. I love the central location of this hotel. We used the pool which was crowded but definetly family oriented. In fact if you don't have kids with you, you may wish to avoid the pool.\\nRoom service was prompt and the food was above average, albeit on the pricey side.\\nI enjoyed the modern granduer of the hotel and thought that the cartoons in the elevators were fun and added to the hip vibe of the place. Le Parker is hip, but not in an snobby way, it seems there is a place for diversity and many kinds of people.\\nWhen it was time to leave, we were so lucky to see Maurice again. He came to help us with our bags and my daughter became so enchanted with his warmth and genuine concern that she insisted on holding his hand as we walked through the lobby. What a sight this was, and Maurice was kind enough to oblige my daughter in this request. I will come back to this hotel because of Maurice and the good feeling of care he encouraged in me. There are so many choices in NYC, and when I originally booked the hotel, there were several venues in the running. What a relief to have chosen the right place for my family where we felt truly welcomed and cared for, and not just \"another\" guest. I stayed at Le Parker Meridien one night in early June, with my daughters ages 8 and 4. I liked the location, close enough to broadway and times square without the crowds and noise. Plus we were able to take an early Sunday morning stroll in CP before starting our day. We booked an oversized room, which was roomy enough for 4, with a double bed and a sleeper sofa plus a regular sofa, table and desk. Great closet space (although we didn't need it.) Cool TV set up -- mounted on a pole and swiveled 180 degrees.\\nAfter taking the girls to Shake Shack and Lion King, we headed back to the hotel for a dip. I was surprised by the $15 charge to use the pool. It definitely felt like being nickeled and dimed. (Want a fridge?, we can give you one, but it will cost money.) Room service was astronomical -- $79 for hotcakes and an omelet with 2 glasses of juice. Fortunately, we had 2 breakfast vouchers that were included in our room price and they covered the bill.\\nI was pleased with the nearby cheap parking. (Not at the hotel, of course, where they wanted $63 to keep my volvo overnight.) Used a garage on 56th between 7th and 8th for $35 all in. (Search online for coupons for QuikPark.)\\nI think we will try a different hotel on our next trip. Great location, big rooms (by New York standards), clean and modern, delicious food both in Normas and room service. Got the park view room and it was an amazing park view. I could see all the way to the Washington (I think) bridge. Made the room feel really spacious. Didn't have my kids with me, but thought it was a great New York property for kids because of the location near the park, Time Square, 5th Ave, rooftop pool and room service menu had stuff for kids like pizza and mac&cheese! It was trendy and stylish, but not overly noisy or so trendy that I wouldn't bring kids. If you want to eat breakfast at wonderful Norma's make reservations. Have stayed here twice since I am a Starwood member and love this hotel. It's away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but very convenient to subway options and attractions in mid-town. The lobby area is great and the nice bar and hidden burger bar (behind the red curtain) get great reviews and are nice to have so close to your room. Another plus - the shower pressure in the bathroom was great. A lifesaver for a weary mom who flew the redeye solo to make a friend's wedding. I've stayed at the Le Parker Meridien several times but it's been awhile. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The bellman are very helpful and knowledgeable about the city. We upgraded to a park view room and the view was amazing. We would turn off the lights at night in the room and just sit and stare out the window taking it all in.\\nI like that they have a Dry Bar close by or you can have them come to your room for a little extra. If you are going out to a show treat yourself and have your hair done. Love it!\\nThe hotel is very kid-friendly. My son loved the coloring book they gave him at check in. We also used the pool and had dinner delivered there for my son. He was in heaven. The only downside is that they charge a little extra for the pool. Not sure why. But I won't complain about that. This is my first time at Le Parker Meridien. Our room, which was a standard room, was spacious, although the bathroom was quite cramped, and there is no bathrobe. The hotel has cute little signs all over, such as the minibar sign, which says something like, \"a minibar not a fridge.\" The hotel has trendy things like a blow dry bar, and they play Tom and Jerry cartoons in the elevators. I went to the bar for a snack, and it was dark, and there were only three choices, hummus, caprese sticks, and a cheese platter. \\nThe location is great, and near shopping, etc. It is just trying to hard for me to enjoy. Just completed a three-night stay for our nephew's high school graduation. As others state, the location is terrific and we were delighted with the park view from our 39th floor room. Bathroom is small (and I wished they provided bathrobes at the price) but room was good-sized and modern, and the free wi-fi was a big plus for us. We also were tickled by the vintage TV (cartoons, a jazz performance and even part of a Chaplin film) shown in the elevator--a smart idea since the rides from our floor could be long, with frequent stops.\\nBreakfast at Norma's was an experience: Bring your appetite because everything is over the top. I had the lox eggs benedict which came with at least half a pound of lox heaped on the side (first time I ever got a doggy bag for breakfast). I've also heard good things about their burger joint.\\nThis was definitely a splurge for us, but as splurges go it was certainly worthwhile. If you want spectacular central park views a tower park view room in this hotel is a must. Room amenities are what you would expect from a high quality mid town hotel. My only complaint is the large CRT TV unit in the bedrooms which feels a bit dated & cumbersome for a hotel of this standard, but the other qualities of the room, amazing park views, rooftop pool and roof sun terrace do make up for this. Good high quality contemporary hotel. Husband is Starwood Gold, so that played into our experience. Room upgraded, to 33rd floor, fantastic view of Central Park. Room was very large, had everything you could need and seemed to be in decent shape (bathroom was a little tight). Location is very central to anywhere you'd like to go. Parked car, very easy, only 10 minutes to retrieve. The staff was very nice, very service oriented. Would absolutely stay there again. I had a pleasant 3 night stay at the PM. I chose to stay here because I had really enjoyed the PM in San Francisco. The hotel is in an amazing location just south of the Park, and close to all the shopping and restaurants you could want to visit, as well as Time Square, and Radio City, etc.\\nWhile the staff was extremely friendly I did get turned down for a request for a room on a higher floor (75$ surcharge). I was under the impression that the hotel had recently been renovated, but my room was only average. While nice and tidy it was tired looking - from the water stained popcorn ceiling, to the mildew in the shower, and shoddy bathroom fixtures.\\nOverall I would stay again due to location, but would hold out for a better rate.\\nPros:\\nLocation\\nThe Burger Joint hidden away behind the lobby\\nFriendly Staff\\nCons:\\nRoom condition could be better (especially bathroom) Our most recent trip to NYC was made all the more fantastic by a warm \"welcome back!\" at the Parker by fine front desker Laurence. Before we could ask, he upgraded us to a beautiful parkview room, where we had close to a perfect experience for five days and nights. As I wax effulgent, I realize I could be hired by the PM's PR people, but believe me, when the experience is less than perfect, I say so (see my scather on Miraval.) Mohammed the bellman was a sweetie who always had a warm smile when I walked through the lobby. And the Frenchman at the desk when we asked for a late checkout was swoon-worthy as well as warm and helpful -- an added treat! Allright, there is a small bone to pick: the hostess at Norma's, the fine brunch resto in the hotel, was cool and unaccommodating when we checked to see whether we could walk in and eat. Mind you, this was a Saturday, high season for a spot like Norma's. Nonetheless, she could have been nicer, suggested other places in the area to eat, etc. As at any place we stay around the world, it is axiomatic at the PM: when you're nice, staff respond in kind, with very few exceptions. As a clinical psychologist, I can't help noticing that, when I read negative reviews about hotels on this and other sites, the lowest ratings are from those people whose extraordinary level of narcissistic entitlement virtually jumps off the page. Simple kindness and a good attitude speak volumes to those in the hospitality business; most people in the service biz are grateful and more than willing to return the same when treated like human beings. I look forward to a return stay at the Parker! We stayed here for 7 nights. Everything was perfect: location, staff, food, rooms. Some of the best burger I´ve tried at the Burger Joint, which is ´hidden´ in the back of the lobby. Also had a great brunch at Norma´s (reservations are a must). Staff very friendly and great service. The concierge helped us out with any question we had concerning recommendations, reservations and general tips. Would definitely go back here on future trips to NYC. Le Parker Meridien hotel has a great location that' about it , \\nThe service is very slow ,the food is decent, \\nI have stayed at the parker few times and i was amazing with the combination of the luxury and simplicity , Something has changed: Employees are miserable.( I think the hotel is under a new management ). it feels like i checked into a hospital not a hotel, Hotel = Hospitality \\nPS: The double beds are very small We stayed here on our second trip to NYC, and it was great. close to Central Park, the Lincoln centre, ant Times Square..Nice clean room. I liked the classic cartoon videos in the elevator.. And the rooftop glass enclosed pooll was awesome, with a view of central park..We walked a lot sightseeing and a hot tub would have been nice to soak in, but they didn't have one, my only disappointment.. The famous Russian Tea Room was only a few doors away, and handy for the theatre after dinner. they served an interesting breakfast, expensive but nice. we'll be back for sure...... My nephew and I recently stayed at the Le Parker Meridian and we booked the hotel based on comments from previous travelers and the response from Lisa at Guest relations. I was impressed that she took the time to answer almost each response whether good or bad. But let me tell you from the moment we walked into the lobby till the day we left we were treated like royalty and I see they do this to everyone as I listened to travelers checking in or just asking questions as we walked thru the lobby. The employees clearly love working here and it shows. The rooms are really nice and the beds are comfortable. I thought our room for two was perfect with an awesome view of Central Park. Bathroom was perfect size and the restaurants to die for! The Burger joint & Norma's are well known to both tourist & locals and offer amazing food! The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect within walking distance of many sites. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and can promise I will return soon! Location was great, the welcome outstanding and everything was perfect for a long weekend \"sisters\" getaway. I've stayed here several times and like the hotel's style, \"cool modern\" rooms, and splendid location. Breakfast prices -- even by NYC standards -- are a shocker! $80 for two coffees, one breadbasket and two glasses of OJ (the waiter's welcoming \"May I pour you some coffee and orange juice\" somehow neglects to mention that the juice is $9 per glass!!). I recently stay at the Parker Meridien, check-in was flawles rooms were small and tired, but it was clean comforable and very good gym. I also enjoyed the bar and my wife loved the dry bar! A wonderful hotel with a very big room, very clean, very friendly staff. I will never forget my stay there. The hotel is situated in one of the best places of NYC, it is one of the best hotels I´ve ever been to - and very convenient. Breakfast is very good, too. \\nNot cheap, but it is worth its price. I booked a junior suite for an overnight stay and was really surprised at how big it was. The room had tons of closet space and nice amenities. The service was really good too. My nieces loved the roof on the pool - warning there is a $15 room fee for using it. We had dinner at the pool and the food and drinks were reasonably priced. The location was perfect and close to everything. I would stay here again. I stayed at this hotel because I was attending an event that was being held there. Here are my thoughts.\\nThe good:\\nThe hotel was clean as you'd expect for a hotel of this class. The lobby area was nice and the lounge area was decorated very well. We didn't order anything so I can't comment on the food or prices. The internet service was fast, which is always hit or miss at hotels, but it was not complimentary. The service fee is just over $16 per day for internet.\\nThe water pressure in the shower was excellent, both in force and volume. Felt like someone was pouring a bucket of water over your head (and I mean that in a good way).\\nThe bad:\\nThis section is longer unfortunately. First off, the beds in the room and the room itself was very small. I suppose they were technically double beds but they looked like just slightly larger than twin beds to me.\\nNext, we were on the 11th floor and our room was directly over construction on the building next door. They started promptly at 7am each morning and it was quite loud, too loud to sleep through.\\nOn the last night of our stay, we decided to go for a quick swim in their pool which was open until 10:45pm. We got there at just after 10pm and were told that there would be a $15 per person charge to use the swimming pool (!). I've never heard of this at a hotel before for registered guests, especially when the room rate was well over $300 per night. Even though we only had maybe 30 minutes of use for that day, the attendant said that was the policy. I was less surprised that the pool was empty after hearing that. We left the area disappointed and went back to our room.\\nWhen we checked into the hotel, they couldn't find our name on the event list so we booked in at the standard rate rather than the discounted event rate. The difference was $29 per night and we were told that we could get this resolved when we checked out and could show that we were part of the event. Ok no problem. Upon check out, I asked about changing the rate and the clerk said she wasn't able to make any changes to the rate. I explained the situation and showed her my credentials for the event, but she still would not help us. She went and talked to someone and came back and said that they couldn't find my name on the event list which of course we already knew as they told us this when we checked in. She said I would have to contact the event coordinator (whom I don't know or have any affiliation with) and that person would have to then contact their sales department and then possibly they could do something. I was told this after she made me wait almost 30 minutes.\\nBoth of these incidents underscored my feeling that customer service is not important to this hotel. This could have been resolved very quickly in both circumstances by reasonable people who were willing to treat customers as they should be treated, but instead I was basically told to go away. Well, I hear you loud and clear Le Parker Meridian. There are many other hotels in Manhattan and based upon my experiences here I cannot recommend this hotel to travelers. My wife and I stayed here and were very pleased with the location and ease of access to the rest of the city. Before we left for NYC we looked up great places to eat lunch, and it turns out the #1 burger place is in the lobby of Le Parker Meridien. Its called the Burger Joint. Great food. I think I stayed more than 5 times in this well located Hotel. Over the years I noticed that no further investments have been made (but prices stayed rather on the high side). In my perception the attractiveness of the hotel suffered a bit. Rooms are used and the stylish flair of the 80s is not so timeless anymore. Sure, the hotel is still well located in the heart of Manhattan, sure the fitness center in the cellar is nice and sure the breakfast place is excellent but still the thrill is gone. Let me caveat by saying I'm a SPG \"Gold for Life\" and have stayed in every SPG property in Manhattan, even some that are no longer SPG (e.g. Essex House, etc). So please take it seriously when I tell you that the Le Parker Meridien really lets itself and the Starwood Franchise down significantly. \\nI'm going to start with the \"Cons\" here, because these stand out the most\\nAt check-in I noticed the Front Desk staff's daily info. sheet on the desk which prominently read... \"Upsell, Upsell, Upsell\" Which makes sense, given that I was told \"we never offer free upgrades even to SPG Platinum and Gold members\" (ummm ok, I didn't ask for one, but thanks for the info).\\nElevators - Don't fall for the \"view\" or high floors - You will be waiting 5-10 minutes for the elevators, which will be completely full. Also, you should know that this building is part residential and the good views of the park are typically private residences. Avoid the upper floors... you were warned.\\nI reserved a junior suite, which at a mere $600/night, was hoping it would be suitably appropriate. It was horrible. It was smaller than most hotel rooms I have been in and is in serious need of an upgrade (you know those popcorn texture ceilings from the 70's... well that is what you get and is probably the last time this place as seen a renovation).\\nThe gym is in a really dark basement (which was formerly the boiler room) it is spread over two floors and there is not a window in the entire place. Additionally they painted the place black and put in really dim lighting... which makes absolutely no sense if you are trying to get a burst of energy in the morning or evening... also they charge to use the gym (think it was $10.00/time).\\nService - Inquired about getting a small tube of toothpaste - \"sure, that will be $10.00\" which seems odd, given that I stayed at a Sheraton the night before in Nashville and they not only gave it to me for free, but brought it up to the room with a smile. It's the little things i guess.\\nThere are all these signs in the room (which try to be clever, but just come across condescending). \"This is a minibar, not a fridge! if you want a fridge one can be provided at an additional charge. If you move any items you will be charged instantly and this will not be reconciled at check out as we will need to investigate.\" Seriously?... at $600/night you should bring me a subzero if I asked for it, and quit being berating and condescending with all of your signage all over the room. Just poor.all around.\\nI generally give hotels an opportunity to respond or try and make things right before putting bad reviews on here. So.. i asked to speak to a manager upon checkout, and was told\" there would not be one available for 30 minutes\". I also wrote to the hotel with all of these comments, to which they responded. \"we are sorry, let us upgrade you to a junior suite next time\" (ha ha... that's ironic... given that I was complaining about the state of the \"junior suite\" in the first case).\\n\"Pros\"\\nLocation is decent, but if I were you, and wanted to be close to the park, I would try the the London Hotel, Sheraton Hotel & Towers, the Trump, or the Hudson. (Something in there for everyone).\\nEmma's for brunch is good, but they have no alcohol license so bloody marys are going to be virgin\\nThe secret burger joint is fun and decent, but go off peak and probably order two as they aren't massive burgers (and I wouldn't wait in line an hour for it). Room adequate, although very small. Norma's 7 the burger place were very good; the lobby bar has wonderful physical attributes (ceiling height, effective use of mirrors and very enjoyable background music. Over-all good value but able to move up with a few room improvements. I was pleasantly surprised by Le Parker Meridian in many ways. Great location, well designed and appointed rooms, excellent staff-no disappointments. I strive to find great fitness centers, and this one is very well done. They have a diverse array of fitness classes including yoga, spinning, and cross training which was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommended for those wishing to stay in shape while in NYC for business or pleasure. The hotel is clean, hip and contemporary. Love the secret burger place inside, and the breakfast restaurant is outstanding. The room was a fantastic value for its hotel class and location in New York City. Best of all was the totally state of the art GRAVITY gym. One of the only hotel gyms I have been to that rival the best private stand alone gyms. Free weights, cardio and machines galore. I will definitely be going back Just wrapped up a quick business trip in NYC where I stayed at the Le Parker Meridien for one night. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. Front Desk attendant, Laurence, was personable and professional upon check in; he upgraded me to a junior suite based on my Gold status. \\nCheck in was easy although I'd recommend additional representatives during peak times to get things moving faster. Check out was fine. No issues with elevator wait times. Very clean, location was great (close to Central Park and shopping), and the bellmen were pleasant to deal with. Also, when I noticed that there were no complimentary bottles of water in my room for Starwood Preferred Guests, I inquired about it to the front desk and was told to have an Evian from the mini-bar on the house... that was a nice gesture and is something that shows me that the hotel is focused on delivery quality customer service. I would stay here again.\\nBTW, although I didn't dine hear this time, earlier in the month my wife and I enjoyed a great brunch at Norma's which is located in the hotel... it's a quite popular higher end brunch venue which is a hotspot for the locals... portions are gigantic but also healthy... quality is excellent. I am all for second chances. In a previous review, I gave LPM in NYC a less than stellar rating due to air conditioning problems on a hot an humid week in Manhattan. This time, on my return trip to this hotel, I was ensured that this issue had been resolved, and it had. I was in The City for an honorary dinner for some of my work, and had other plans as well. Therefore, The Parker was to be my home away from home. I used every feature the hotel offered, from early swims in the pool (arrive early, lap swimmers, as the pool becomes an area for children later in the day), to workouts in the gym (very nice by Manhattan Hotel standards). Top ratings on all counts for that portion of the hotel.\\nThe staff were perfect. As a resident of the New York City area (and a former resident of Manhattan), I am not in need of over the top friendliness. I view this behavior as disingenuous. No need for faux niceties. On the other hand, I do require professionalism and assistance when called for. This is exactly what I found on this trip. From the customer relations staff, to the bell staff, all check-in and check-out procedures were handled quickly and efficiently. Exactly what is called for in NYC. I had the car I had called for waiting for me when I left one morning, with a friendly umbrella loaned for an extremely wet day. I had cabs called as soon as the door-man recognized me walking through the 56th street entrance. He even became used to my destinations and informed the cabbie for me. This is how a door-man should operate.\\nThe restaurants: The Burger Joint (or whatever moniker it is being called these days!) offers a very nice, no frills burger. Fries are decent and the shakes are above the standard. Lines were long, so I arranged a lunch brought to my room, and it was there in 15 minutes. Perfect. Erma's (sp?) was great for breakfast and the Moroccan (I hope that was the theme they were going for, as that is exactly what it reminded me of) themed bar on the 57th street entrance was especially nice for drinks, especially one night when I got in past 1:30 am. Oh, and the patrons were especially easy on the eyes, for those of you who need something of that nature.\\nAs noted, room service was efficient and quick, and the food was certainly above par for that matter. I am of the mind that delivered food loses something, and have had room service at The London and The Mandarin, roughly in the same area as TPM NYC and this food was just as good if not better than those two, which boast high end restaurants. For the times I ordered, I always kept it simple and was not disappointed. \\nFinally, the location speaks for itself. Great. The room was simple and high quality, in my estimation. Clean and recently renovated, I requested a no bathtub room, as I wanted a large shower to relax in (I enjoy the extra room this offers...). \\nI did not enjoy the spa, but did make use of the barber for a trim and shave. Excellent. 'Nuff said.\\nAll in all, a quality stay worth the value added price. I would recommend this hotel and will be staying again. Le Parker is a great hotel, in a good part of town. Grand entrance hall, but a little hard to find from 56th street. Room was on 73th floor with views over central park. Maybe for the price some of the decor could be updated. Staff OK, not super friendly. A good pleasant stay. We needed a get away... New York City for the weekend. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else. Clean and contemporary. Two blocks or so from a horse drawn carriage ride through Central Park, a short walk to Times Square and Fifth Avenue shopping. The Hotel is ideally situated, and makes a number of attractions easily acccesible. The rooms, while nothing spectacular, were cerainly adequate. The staff were very accomodating. We needed to change our room, and this was accomplished without a problem. For our iinconvenience, the Hotel provided us with a bottle of Evian water, and a fruit platter.\\nThey granted us an extended checkout time, again without any static. My first stay in New York and amazing trip! If anyone has ever dreamt of coming to the big city then do so - dont let anyone or anything stop you (I had to save 5 years and went on my own but it was worth every penny!). The hotel made it for me - comfortable, quiet, helpful (to a point, NY staff are always quite 'to the point' although the girls on the gym reception and maids were lovely), perfect location (just a stones throw from central park and Tiffanys/fifth avenue and much better than staying in the thick of it as I got a perfect nights sleep which geared me up for the day ahead). A fab trip, a fab hotel, fab TV in room, very clean and decent gymnasium The location in central Manhattan with proximity to Central Park, subway stations, tourist attractions and shopping places is the best part of the hotel. The rooms are very spacious for the location and very comfortable. Service is good. Pricey hotel, though considering its Manhattan location. One thing which could improve things is to install a coffeemaker in the rooms. Fantastic hotel in the heart of the city, 10 minute walk to Time Square.\\nRooms clean and of a good size, ours with great view over Central Park (upgrade).\\nAll the staff were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful.\\nHad a couple of drinks in the bar, which were expensive.\\nNormas for breakfast...........brilliant. Stayed here 5/25-28/2012 on vacation. The hotel was conveniently located near Central Park and had a subway station nearby for traveling to Times Square, etc. Room was large, quiet and very clean. Several Duane Reade grocery.pharmacy stores were within walking distance of hotel. Would definitely stay here again. The hotel reception is very effetient and professional. Hotel breakfast is awesome, the best egg benedict I ever had. Hotel Spa is excellent. So many hotels in NY and this is one of the good ones where so many are a disappointment. Nice and close to Central Park, 5th Avenue, Bloomingdales and lots of good restaurants a few blocks away. Comfortable rooms which were good size. Building site next door creates noise from 7 am. Charges introduced recently for swimming pool are unwelcome. Some of the public area furniture needs attention and updating. Our room did not have good soundproofing as next door TV could be clearly heard, also noise from elevator.\\nHotel was chosen with great packege through BA and the location was perfect ie 2 blocks from our daughter. Spent 5 nights here with my family. Got guaranteed connecting rooms! Almost unheard of anywhere else. Rooms were roomy with a decided lack of storage. Noticed one room had an umbrella but ours didn't. We had two glasses but they had only one? Recently updated and adequately comfortable with the exception of lack of control on temperature. loved the burger bar, Knaves lounge, and the ultra expensive and delicious Norma's. Most of the concierge were quite helpful, but ran into some condescension, hey I'm from the sticks and don't understand mass transit. Only real gripe is when we showed up at 3:30 they said our 2nd room wasn't ready? How is this acceptable and what were you willing to do to compensate us? Never got an answer. great family weekend. staff was very accommodating. totally recommend. Perfunctory front of house staff and at times condescending. Very good location. Room on eleventh floor trying to hip-boutique without carrying it off. And if you are trying to be hip, lose the dated and huge tv that didn't work properly, and give your guests an iPod device. So, to set the record straight, they have not addressed the tvs and no DVD player. Usual offer of exhorbitantly priced PPV movies, which in the digital age is crass. Concierge guys outside the hotel, and helping with baggage were all a delight. Team working on the bar were great. Overall, great location, confused and even slightly cheesy concept that is laughably trying to be something else, very good standards of cleanliness, service nioticeably variable by department team. room was really nice, location is great near by train station and walking distance to the central park. staff was friendly I've already reviewed the hotel, but wanted to update since on my recent visit I learned that the hotel has made the leap into modern times with the addition of the new flat screen TVs! Yay. The staff is always friendly and the rooms are very clean -- and you can't beat the location. My one disappointment thisntime around is that the Internet went down right when I needed it the most. I also think the Internet is kind of expensive ($16+). The hotel is very clean and very high-end. But, it's one of the noisiest places we've ever stayed--external construction work until midnight each night, very metallic doors slamming (think college dorm slams), loud hallways, and lots of kids. Our staff person at check out was VERY rude too. The hotel is in a great location, just 2 blocks from Central Park. Very clean with small but nice rooms. The location makes this hotel a great place to stay. $40 for a family of 4. Not only it's probably the only hotel in the world that charges for its pool, but there's no disclosure whatsoever of this highly unusal charge on their website, so they get you when the kids are tugging to go. This hotel added LOTS of magic to our NYC getaway! We arrived at LeParkerMeridien by subway from LaGuardia. Easily accessible if you don't have a problem riding public transportation. There are several subway stations within a 5 minute walk from this hotel. I must add - our hotel reservation was made 6 weeks in advance using a govt employee rate - huge savings! Within 24 hrs of making the reservation, a hotel employee called us to tell us that the room that we had reserved was a \"handicapped accessible\" room. They had a family that needed the room and if we would be willing to give the room tho that family - they would upgrade us for FREE. We quickly agreed. \\nOur suite was HUGE!!!!! King bed, 2 sofas, office desk and a spacious bathroom. FINALLY - finally, a hotel that READ our reservation - 4 people in the room - and they made certain to have enough linens for every single person! Wow! A+\\nCheck-in was seamless, in spite of long lines and a very large wedding party that crowded the lobby. \\n2 heating/cooling units in our suite. Temp was perfect - if you need ANY temp adjustments - you must call the front desk, none of the units are adjustable and are all pre-programmed. When I felt too cold - I just turned the units off for a few hours. Bath products were by Peter Thomas Roth - indulgent and luxurious - be prepared to take very long showers! Housekeeping was impeccable. The room was clean and updated. 56th St was closed our first night, so there was no traffic and very little noise outside. \\nThe rooms do not have coffee makers or refrigerators - but there are plenty of coffee shops on every corner. Plenty of clothes storage for 4 people. Safe in the room for our iPads, iron, blow dryer. \\nBeware! The use of the pool is extra $$$!!!!! They do NOT advertise that $15/day, but it was a bargain for 1 day. The pool is located on the top floor and ALL should experience it! You are on top of the world! The view of Central Park, East Side, West Side, and Manhattan - you feel privileged just to be there. The pool is tiny, but their facilities are updated and clean and they try to indulge you. They provide towels, goggles, and swim toys. There is an observation deck from the top floor you see it all! Empire State Bldg, Central Park, and many many many more iconic NYC buildings! \\nCheck out is 11am, but we called the front desk and request a late check-out and they painlessly gave it to us - for FREE. \\nThe hotel staff does not share secrets or tips - so ask them about anything - even if you fear being labeled an idiot. The staff was a bit indignant but you quickly grow to accept that in NYC. My tips: book early, visit the pool, acquaint yourself with the hotel's 57th St exit/entrance - saves you time and energy! My husband and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 3 nights in mid April, before leaving on a cruise. The location of this hotel couldn't be better. Never being to NYC before, we were able to see the highlights very easily from the hotel and walked everywhere with no problems. I had booked the AAA breakfast rate and wow, what a wonderful breakfast. Terrific choices and great food, which the rate also covered the tax and tip, which is unusual at other places we have stayed. Would highly recommend this property for a stay in NYC. Thank you for a great start to our cruise. This is a great property due to the location. Service and almost everything else was okay. Rooms are dark and sparsely furnished. I realized I forgot a toothbrush and called the front desk... They told me that they do not have toothbrushes and that I would have to come down the gift shop and buy one. $10 later I had a tooth brush. Hampton Inn's even have a toothbrush for guests who forget. As an SPG Platinum member this was disappointing. Overall for $400+ per night this is an average experience. You are paying for location and that is it. Great location, clean rooms. As I was travelling with my two teenage children, I reserved two rooms, one room specifically with two double beds. When I arrived thay couldnt accomodate the room with the double beds and could only offer me room on two seperate floors which required us to go to the lobby to take a different elevator every time we wanted to go to each others rooms. Additionally, they charged my credit card for $800.00 to cover room incidentals. While this is apparently normal practise, they failed to advise me of the amount they were charging and it did inconvenience me later when I went to use the card. A half hearted apology was all I got. Thank god my bank was much more accomodating. I enjoyed my stay at this fantastic hotel! The service was great and the Le Parker Meridien was a nice place to come home to. I was in New York working long hours, and I needed a quiet room on a high floor to escape to at night. The front desk clerk gave me the perfect room and housekeeping kept the room spotless! I would definitely stay here again! Love the location. I only had 24 hours in NYC so I took the full advantage of the location of this hotel. I was able to spend a couple hours at Central Park, went to the Guggenheim museum and then attended a symphony at the Carnegie Hall at night. Had a brunch at the Burger Joint and Lobster roll at Lukes. Still had plenty of time to catch my flight back to Chicago from EWR. As a SPG platinum member, I've got upgraded to a Junior suite and it's perfect for a solo traveler like me. I have stayed at multiple Ws previously when I was in town, but the stay here at LM was much better. I like the contemporary and sophisticated (but unpretentious) decor (except for the old TV ;) and the services are excellent. I'm glad that I didn't see/meet any snobby associates at this property!! We spent 10 nights here in a Junior suite and would recommend it to anyone. The room size is excellent and VERY large for New York and the hotel location is central to everything. We'll certainly stay here again and again. After many trips to New York and staying at a different hotel every time I have finally found one I will go back too. You can walk to Broadway and the shows in 5 minutes or Central Park or 5th Avenue in the same time. Even a Starbucks right across the road ! The positives are obvious: This is great location, right by Carnegie Hall. By NYC standards, the hotel is \"small\" and feels more intimate than many others. We did not need any unusual service, but were pleased with the staff's responsiveness in general.\\nHowever, there are two negatives, how important will depend on your needs and temperament. First, this was probably our first and only hotel experience ever when there was no coffee in the room. Who feels like dressing up and going down 35 floors at 6AM just for a cup of coffee? Second, complimentary wifi is limited to the lobby and is not offered in the room. Most unwelcoming if you need to check or send email early morning or late night. \\nOther than these two \"Soviet touches to customer service\"---coffee is a normal human gesture offered by most hotels, and in this day and age wifi is not some exotic technology but part of infrastructure on par with electricity and running water---we were pleased with our stay. \\nTo summarize, we will consider this hotel again, but will also look around for other good hotels that do not add such edges to the experience. 1 night stay but excellent throughout, from rapid checkin and checkout to a clean, spacious, well designed room and friendly design touches throughout. Love the cartoons on the screen in the lift - bye bye CNN! We were here exactly 5 years ago, this time we book through a booking service that got us a room upgrade (view of the park). Everything was clean, the room safe did not work, and we were not around long enough to wait for security to come up to the room and fix it.\\nThey could use new tv's---they are still using the same ones from our last visit. Coming from Chicago, the cost per night was reasonable. If you want to go to NYC, you need to be ready to spend $. The new tv's are a great improvement, it's a shame they didn't do more with the refurb. A top hotel deserves more that a curtain across a cupboard in place of a wardrobe and the safe is mounted on the floor with the door opening towards you so you have to get down on hands and knees ad crawl into the cupboard to get at it (coupled with an internal light that stays on for 5 seconds - I timed it). The room was lovely and clean and a great sized tub in the bathroom with nice quality toiletries. I used the gym twice a day and it's a shame that there is a charge even if it is only $10 for the day. Overall a good hotel and well placed geographically. Everything was flawless about my hotel experience - from check-in to checkout. It was great. I would definitely stay again. We stayed for my daughter's 8th birthday trip. I had never stayed at Le Parker before, though I've known of its good reputation for many years and even worked right down the street from it for a long time. Before the trip, I emailed to ask if perhaps a card or balloon or somesuch could be delivered to the room for my child's birthday. Instead, we were delighted to receive an upgrade to a Park View room, which was absolutely gorgeous, and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and other fruit delivered to her with a birthday card! I thought this was truly going over and above my request, and I appreciated it tremendously! The front desk staff as well as every other employee we encountered was pleasant and in many cases effusively kind, which was lovely given that sometimes in NY hotel staff can tend toward being curt. We consider Le Parker M our new go-to NYC hotel and look forward to many more stays.\\nI have only two complaints: the elevators are quite slow (once it took my husband 15 minutes to get from our room on the 36th floor to the lobby), and the staff at Norma's restaurant was very aloof and disinterested in us as customers. We took my daughter there for her actual birthday breakfast, which we had hoped would be special based upon the reviews we read, and we were treated very indifferently. I had hoped for kindness and perhaps even a \"happy birthday\" said to her, but we received neither. The food was delicious, although much too plentiful and overpriced even for NYC, but we will not return due to the staff at the restaurant. I was very impressed. The staff is excelent. The location is perfect. I will definitely come back on my next trip to NY. I spent 1 night here on a date with my wife. There are plenty of nearby parking options and the hotel is located quite close to Central Park South. The hotel area is appropriate for a touristic visit to the City. Hotel check-in was quick and efficient. Our room was large by NYC standards and well appointed. Overall, a very nice stay. Nice upper mid level hotel in a good location. However some of the rooms are showing there age; also no coffee maker in the room and really expensive internet ( why do hotels marketing themselves as upper end insist on massive internet charges when almost every budget hotel has free internet--it seems that the more expensive the average room the more the more the hotel thinks it can charge for wifi). Some of the upper floor rooms have a great view of central park.\\nService is good but not great, the Burger joint is good but not worth the long lines that it sometimes has.\\nJust an OK value Good hotel ... has everything except a bar. If we could just get a bar here its an even greater place. Convienient, happy , no drama, good service, fantastic gym , hairdressers to die for for quick blow dries ( book !) hamburger spot is great.. just wish i could have a glass of wine that's not in the hallway.Staying alone as a woman you don't want to go to a stranger bar and having pounded the life out of NYC .. i needed just one. OMG Norma's ... top ! We enjoyed our recent stay at the Parker Meridien. We were in a Jr suite which work well for 3 of us (2 adults and 1 child). We liked how we could turned the TV around to the living area or the sleeping area. We had breakfast at Norma's (very good) and the Burger Joint (very good too). I liked how the Burger Joint is hidden behind the huge red velvet curtain. My husband and daughter went to the rooftop pool but didn't stay too long as it was a little crowded. The Hotel has a great location, walking distance to most midtown attractions and the subway stations are within a 2 blocks. Would stay here again. The location of this hotel was our first choice. Upon arrival, the first person extending his warm welcome was the bell-hop (an older man), then the front desk staff who were friendly, courteous and professional. The room was clean; bed sheet and pillow case were fresh; the bathroom, toilet, tub were clean. The house keeping staff were courteous, smile while greeting us in the hallway; they did a great job in keeping the room clean. The hotel staff's attitude made our stay so much more enjoyable. My last review was middle of the road and my biggest complaint was the old TV and the poor TV reception in the room along with the long waits for the elevator.\\nWell they are finally upgrading all the rooms with flat screen LCD's and the reception is much better. When I checked in, the guy behind the counter made sure I got a room that was upgraded which was nice and he put me in a handicap room. I'm not handicap and didn't request this and my only complaint was the sink was too low in the bathroom but the overall size of the room was much bigger then room I had during my last visit. \\nEven though I was on a lower floor, it still seemed like the elevator was doing awhile to come down to the lobby even though it didn't seem that busy. Don't know if all the elevators were in service or not but until I don't have to wait 5 min in the lobby, i'll keep this at a 4 star rating. Everyone was friendly and helpful and the room was nice and clean each night that I got back.\\nWill def stay here more often even though it's slightly further from the office then the Sheraton down the street that I usually stay at. Nice hotel, great location, very friendly staff from housekeeping, bellman, concierge and front desk staff. Rate was good and I got upgraded to a junior suite due to my Platinum status. Title says it all... Very nice hotel, great location for midtown Manhatten (close to everything without having Times Square on top of you). I would stay again, but I had a couple of niggles...\\nFirstly, I found it surprising that a 5 star hotel charges to use their pool - this is the first time in my travels to 30+ 5 star hotels that a charge is levied for pool access. Locally, I have stayed at the Mandarin and the Penninsula in NY and neither charge for pool access - it seems slightly 'tight' and this impression was reiterated slightly later in our stay.\\nSecondly, the hotel is also not prepared for infants - which surprised me. Having travelled to St Lucia, Copenhagen and Australia in the past 8 months with a baby in tow - all the hotels that I stayed at have thoroughly supported infants; sterilizing bottles (microwaving the bottle container), providing fresh boiling water and in one case providing freshly pprepared baby food for free (this wasn't even a child friendly hotel). When I first asked at the concierge desk, they were somewhat baffled and then started suggesting that it would cost $10-20 (penny pinching for boiled water and microwave usage). Ultimately, one of the waiting staff was very helpful and providied the microwaving service and the concierge desk provided both a kettle and microwave (which unfortunately was too small).\\nBut, to reiterate the point that the hotel could be far more prepared and endorse people with infants. Providing a bad experience to parents now are likely to alienate them and is very easily communicated to other parents through online networks and even tripadvisor.\\nIn the end, all worked out well for us and so i would recommend again. As an SPG member I wanted to stay in one of their properties on my first trip to New York in March. Le Parker was close to where we would be visiting (Lincoln Center, Times Square, etc.) and had good ratings. Plus we were going to use points. At first glance, I wasn't sure about the quality. Having never been to New York and relying on the SPG website and TripAdvisor for advice, it \"seemed\" like a good choice, but who knew.\\nCheck in was quick and we were treated quite nicely. Lots of hustle and bustle, but we still felt taken care of. We stopped by the concierge for some quick questions about dinner choices before the Met Opera performance that night. He was great (which allowed me to call him later) and set us up for the Lincoln at Lincoln Center. A perfect choice for a wonderful evening.\\nWe got up to the room and it reminded me of the hallway and rooms in \"Lost In Translation\". I love that movie and I loved this room. Lots of unique things including a swiveling television tower, great woodwork and curtains, lots of closet space, lots of built-ins, floor to ceiling mirror, and a really comfy bed. It felt like a room in someones house. It was cleand. And I loved the view. While you could only see a thin slice of Central Park, there was a ton of other stuff to look at. Very comfy.\\nThe best part was when we were getting ready for dinner and the Opera. I had brought along instructions on how to tie a new bowtie, but couldn't quite make it work. I called the concierge and luckily got the one we had talked to earlier. I coyly asked if he knew how to tie a bowtie and he quickly offered to come up and and help. Just a few minutes later he was in our room helping me out. He was incredibly nice and never made me feel stupid or treated my like a hick from Kansas.\\nOur visit was way too short: I could have stayed a week. One cool encounter: On our way out the door the next day we spied Charles Barkely in the lobby. THAT was awesome. I was upgraded to what seemed to be a junior suite with more closets than my own place. The TV stands between the living room and bedroom and swivels where I want to be. It was very nice to sleep in the comfy bed. The darkening curtains close off the early morning sunlight...a must for a restful sleep. The windows are sound proof, since I was not disturbed by noise produced by overnight trucks. It was delightful. While we booked one of the more modest rooms at Le Parker Meridien -- the staff never made us feel anything but welcome and went out of their way to help us in every aspect of our stay. The room was excellent - clean, modern, and comfortable with an extraordinary view. The hotel's proximity to Central Park, the MOMA, and the Alvin Ailey theatre made it an ideal location for us. Though our stay was only 24 hours -- it felt much longer in a very rich and positive way. We would recommend this hotel to all of our friends. It is well located for midtown. I stayed 10 days in this hotel and I was in a junior suite. The room was very spacious and clean but as in many hotels not a lot of light inside. \\nThe beds and pillows are comfortable although my main problem was the constant street noise and the noise of the air conditioned at night. As a previous review has suggested maybe they have the original construction windows. \\nThe hotel is quite pricey for no additional free services such as Gym, breakfast, Wifi…… \\nSo a mix review that has to resukt in an average score. \\nHighlights: Concierge service and Burger Joint in the lobby. Could be this one of the best burgers you ever have? So here's the nitty gritty:\\n-The hotel rooms are clean and spacious by NYC standards. I had a nice view of central park. No qualms there. The TV is an old tubeTV - not a big deal as I rarely watch it. If you just want a place to lay your head down thats clean and has a comfortable bed, this works.\\nHere's where things go sour:\\n-This hotel will typically cost you between $400 - $700 depending on the season and the night... more or less... (I paid around $450)... I get there and I'm ready to get a swim in at the pool before my meetings - they inform me that they now charge $15 to swim in the pool (that was free 3 months ago).\\n-Then I decide, ok fine - maybe I'll go hit the gym... well, there's a $10 or $15 charge for the gym in the hotel... this is getting silly.\\n-So I call downstairs that evening as I'd run out of toothpaste in my travel kit... yep, you guessed it... they said \"Sorry sir, we have toothpaste in the gift shop that you can come down and purchase....\" ... the motel 6 will help me out if I forget my toothpaste...\\n-The next morning I wake up and realize I forgot my razor and needed a shave - I call downstairs, yup, same thing.. \"Sorry sir, you can come down to the gift shop and purchase a razor....\" you're getting the point here.\\n-During check out, a colleague had to fax a document to me - she kept getting the run around as to what number to fax to, and who to fax it to... long story short, after about 45 minutes... no document - the staff was confused... so I left and went to Kinkos.\\n-Then, they said to save paper they would send me an electronic bill... I've called them twice, and on the third time I finally got it.\\nHere's the point. If you're going to brand yourself as a premium hotel, take care of your customers. Don't nickel and dime people to use amenities like your gym (or pool - which WAS a draw to staying here). When customers request toothpaste or a 25 cent razor... don't nickel and dime them. Send it to their room with a smile.\\nI usually stay at the W - and their service is impeccable compared to this place. I was a bit worried from the reviews here, but from the moment I walked in, I knew it would be a fantastic stay! I arrived at 7:15 on a Saturday morning and my room was already ready, which was so wonderful. It was a gorgeous, spacious room that I was sad to leave (I actually cut some of my plans short so I could come back and hang around the room for a bit). \\nIt was really chilly in NYC and I called about turning the heat up before I left. When I got back, they'd left a space heater by my door, which was very much appreciated. The staff was very friendly and I would go back to this place in a heartbeat. Only regret is that I was only there for a night.\\nNot sure what people mean by outdated, etc. I had a huge flat screen, great toiletries and the room was well decorated. The towels were lush and soft, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the layout of the room was great for moving around and spreading out. The only disappointment was that wireless was $16.95 a day, but there's a Starbucks across the street.\\nCheck in here! Just spent a night there. Decent room, but not overwhelming. Biggest issue was rudness of the desk staff-low end service from them -- they appeared to be overwhelmed--especially if asked a question..if you need anything the door people are great. \\nHad a 1/2 day meeting and those facilities were very good. I rated service average as the people involved in the meeting were very good, the desk people were low end so the service averages out to average---make sense--hope so We had 2 days in New York at the end of my husband's business trip. The Le Parker was in an excellent position, near Central Park and 5th Avenue. \\nThe room itself was comfortable - very large, with a good sitting area.\\nThe shower was a bit strange - it was very long and the shower floor had a significant slope down to the shower. This was VERY slippery when wet, especially if there was any soap. Would not recommend if you are unsteady on your feet. The bed was OK. Air-conditioning was stifling - we set it on 19 Deg Cel - but felt like it was at 26 Deg Cel.\\nThe restaurant - Norma's was excellent - this is apparently an NY institution - I totally agree with this. The breakfast was amazing, large sizes, excellent service.\\nI would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be near Central Park. Stayed here for a night...then moved out if that's indicative of anything.\\nChecked in, no issues there. Bellman brought my luggage up to my room....cept he threw it. I was a bit confused. Anyways, I personally don't like the room style - big personal preference. I also found the outdated technology to be shocking. Category 6 Starwood property? Really? There was a 32in Sony Triniton TV in a rotating wall sitting there. Anyways, my room REEKED of smoke so I asked to be move. I guess SPG gold status got me moved to a suite (would have just been easier when I checked in?). Same bellman, I offered to carry my own luggage...\\nJust overall an underwhelming, slightly old and dilapidated hotel. Also, the almonds in the mini bar were $9. Just saying...\\nThe gym is GREAT except that you have pay $10 per visit - why not just include it in the price?\\nAnyhow, I hopped around hotels in NYC, probably won't be staying at the Meridien anytime soon unless everything else is sold out. From our checkin to checkout we truly enjoyed every service and the great responsiveness of the staff. Stayed here for one night and here are my observations on the plusses and minuses:\\nPlusses:\\n1) Great location\\n2) Terrific water pressure in shower\\n3) Comfortable bed\\nThe minuses:\\n1) Lots of street noise (I was on 12th floor). Having stayed in many other midtown hotels, this was by far the noisiest. Windows must be original construction\\n2) Flat screen TV's, but no HD! It's 2012 folks. Watching a standard def picture on a flat screen tv is ridiculous for an upscale midtown property\\n3) Others have observed that you cannot adjust the room temperature by yourself. You must call the front desk to have someone come up. Not very practical. I returned from an evening engagement at 11 o'clock to find the room chilly. Was I really supposed to call the front desk at that time and wait for someone to show up to make the room warmer?\\nI do hope that the hotel will consider improving on these points. I stayed in a jnr suite which has a little more space and is clean but not necessarily well equipped: there is no free wi fi in the room, the tv is large but the picture signal is not great, and the shower head temperature control was not fully functioning. The room decor is modern, but the combination of grey, brown, and orange together with low lighting isn't working for me - quite depressing to stay indoors. \\nWhat further bothers me is that guests get charged:\\ncharged $5 for using the pool per day and $10 for the gym\\nmore than $16 for a jar of cashew nuts from the mini bar (seriously, it wasn't a kilo in weight or anything)\\noh, and the pricey gimmicks such as if you want to use the 'dry bar', it will set you back $40 for someone to blow dry it for you. A msg saying 'don't do it' (i.e. yourself) is placed next to the hairdryer. \\nBest bits: The location is great for the park and good for tourists as v. centrally located, and the burger joint downstairs in the lobby is a contender for the best burger in NYC. Rooms are large, which is a real bonus in NYC. Staff on both the reception desk and concierge desk were very friendly, efficient and very professional. Food in Norma's and the Burger Bar were memorable. The hotel is in a great location; close to Central Park, Times Square, Broadway and shops around 5th Ave. Lots of good restaurants within walking distance. Stayed for several days with grandkids. Fantastic expeerience. Front desk upgraded us to a larger available room. Fantastic city and park views, 2 bathrooms, excellent in room dining service, and the pool on roof which got visited every day - great morning aquasize class; singing Bellman (really funny with grands). Excellent location. Staff very friendly and helpful. Got upgraded to a Junior Suite for free. Really great hotel. Will definitely stay again. Forget about special, or glam details of some trendy hotels.\\nWe visit NYC often and we regularly end up staying here. Why?\\n1. Location is great, for midtown. Perfect for morning runs in central park, especially when you are just in from Europe.\\n2. The fitness center and the pool are really good. I would say above most NY hotels.\\n3. The Burger Joint is very cool an we all end up there. Great idea in a big hotel.\\n4. ROoms are ok. Very standard and no style or frills but quite big. \\nSome of the staff can be a bit arrogant at Norma's which is recommendable breakfast experience (need advance booking). Everyone else is just ok.\\nBreakfast alternative is either Starbucks or Dean and De Luca (this one take it if you have time since it is so slow), both across the street on 56th. Le PM sports a great location but at prices upwards of $500/night this hotel disappoints. The room is particularly average and devoid of amenities available in every local Radisson . Everything cost extra including Internet access. Not even a coffee maker in the room and room service which the management strongly encourages is unaffordable at $8 for a cup of tea.\\nElevators did not work and the wait to get down from the thirtieth floor was upwards of ten minutes each morning. Mainly a business hotel ( our reason for staying) and one distraught business person complained that he was late to a meeting due to elevator problem. Save your $ for a broadway show and the Hampton Inn which is close and offers more and better amenities. I stayed at Parker Meridien for tow nights on a business trip this past week. I finally managed an upgrade after trying for four years on my annual trip to NYC for an event in April. The 1BR suite was a perfect size and really quite functional for someone who is working, going back and forth to an office during the day in midtown, changing clothes for meetings and evening events, etc. The bathroom was huge and I loved the design of the modern shower. I did not order room service or use the gym or pool on this trip. \\nI had breakfast both mornings in Norma's and found the eggs \"odd\", there is no other word, each time. They were fluffy in a fake way and seemed to have been coated in some sort of fake butter and still had no real flavor. The applewood bacon was heavily peppered for some reason and almost inedible. \\nAs mentioned, the larger room really enhanced my stay this time and made the end of my work days highly relaxing. The staff is good and responsive here and there are usually no surprises if you request something from them. My one complaint was the slowness of the elevators; particularly in the morning hours when people are on their way to work or meetings. They really need to upgrade them in some way. \\nParker is not my favorite hotel in NYC, but its convenience to my office in midtown and other attractions makes it a mainstay for my trips to the city. Stayed for several days with grandkids. Fantastic expeerience. Front desk upgraded us to a larger available room. Fantastic city and park views, 2 bathrooms, excellent in room dining service, and the pool on roof which got visited every day - great morning aquasize class; singing Bellman (really funny with grands). I have stayed at this hotel more than 15 times. The biggest plus is the very large and well equipped gym (which you have to pay for unless you are Platinum SPG). The beds are comfortable (just like all Westins) and are the biggest reason for staying here. The location is not bad, particularly if you want to be near Central Park. The breakfast is pretty good, particularly the granola\\nThe list of negatives cannot be ignored - and some are quite material:\\nThe room decorations are tired (and so can appear grubby), the fittings are pretty basic (other than the comfortable desk chair)\\nThe standard bathrooms are tiny (and the junior suites only have a shower)\\nThe cupboard is actually just a cheap curtain passing itself off as chic\\nYou cannot adjust the in-room thermostat...when I asked to get my room cooler, they sent someone up to my room who proceeded to open the window (on the 38th floor)!!\\nThe breakfast is very expensive, particularly when they tried to charge me $12 for a toasted bagel and butter\\nThe elevators are slow and the wait at peak periods can be frustrating This is a typical luxury New York hotel. Very expensive, but worth it. Good amenities, fairly clean rooms (I think it's a former apartment building.) Good service and if you need this location, it's very competitive with the neighboring properties.\\nThe hotel business in NYC is so crazy. It's like nothing else in the world. If you've stayed in New York a lot, you know what I mean. If you don't have much experience with NYC hotels, it's daunting and a wild experience.\\nSo this hotel is certainly a safe bet, but the price is probably way beyond most people's ability. If you're traveling on business and can fit it in your budget, you won't be disappointed. \\nBut if you're adventurous and have this kind of budget, you could do better unless you absolutely have to stay on this block. I didn't find the particular amenities to be all that interesting. The decor is dated and a bit worn. And there are so many endless choices that I think I would have chosen somewhere else. (But my reservation was made by my client, so I had no choice.) Read the reviews, heard the arguments, listened to the rebuttals. Here's the deal on this property:\\n-Excellent location in the city, blocks from the park, plenty of restaurants and food options nearby, and easy walk to Times Square (15 tiny blocks or so). \\n-The fitness center, while excellent compared to other hotels - something like 15,000 square feet, including very nice shower facilities, it's not the best fitness center anywhere in the city (I think someone claimed that). Anyway, tons of equipment, reasonable entrance charge, and the place was largely empty the two occasions I visited. Personal trainer on hand at all times, and complimentary fresh fruit. \\n-The rooms are nice. We had a standard on the 27th floor. It was spacious for a NY hotel. Two double beds were comfortable. TV was perfectly fine, and had a swivel on it. \\n-Staff were friendly throughout the visit, from check-in to check-out. \\n-Complimentary wifi in the lobby (you need the code)\\n-The property is showing a bit of wear and tear, but nothing dramatic. ie: a few chips on the walls, and such. The elevators were constantly slow. \\n-Some things to be bummed about. No coffee maker. Too bad too, because there is plenty of space for one. No refrigerator, but they do have a minibar. The HVAC unit is hands off! The thermostat cannot be adjusted. This was occasionally uncomfortable. On a warm afternoon though, we were able to crack open the window and get fresh air (and street noise) in. \\nOverall, if a fitness center is important to you, drop what you're doing and book this hotel. The rooms and location are also great, but balance this with price, as there are other hotels in the area. Loved the location. Close to subways and right behind Carnegie Hall. Le Parker Meridien is my hotel of choice when in NY. It has a fantastic location, great rooms and rates and many of the employees are there from trip to trip. Nice hotel. Stayed a few times in the past and was always superior...until recently. Room furnishings were tired and dated, and electronics were poor. Regular TV reception was very poor (no HD or I-pod player). Spent alot of money on an upgraded \"Park-view\" room, only to be staring at a construction crane. When I tried to move, there was nothing left..and no adjustment of our bill. Also spent alot of money on room service for diner and breakfast, which was mediocore at best. But the worst part was being charged a fee to use the hotel pool. I have used this pool many tmes without being charged, so when the front desk advised me of this charge I couldn't believe it. For the amount of money that this hotel charges for everything, to charge to use the pool is unconscionable. If you have a choice, stay somewhere else and save some money. Checked in last week and had read reviews that the staff was unfriendly. So untrue. Anandi Nellore helped us check in and then called the room to find out of all was ok. I said the view of Central was spectacular but that the room was quite small. She called back a short time later and said that she would move us to a suite the next day. The hotel to fully booked our first night. The suite was great. \\nAll of the staff were friendly, helpful and bent over backwards to be of assistance. I was handed an umbrella as I walked out of the hotel into pouring rain. I'm a frequent traveler and have stayed at several NYC hotels. Generally speaking what sets hotels apart in NYC are the quality & friendliness of the staff, attention to small details and room quality. The rooms are in general smaller and a bit dingier than other cities. But at the top end of the hotels, one finds the waldorf, the W, St Regis etc which are a cut above the le meridien in terms of property quality. The service is so so and the other amenities are ok. The location is great however. But if you are looking to spend dollars in this range - look elsewhere Great property. Location is really great - close to 30 Rock and most of the big attractions. Rooms are designed to make the use of space and have a great setup. My only problem was that the hotel was a little strict about the raging party we threw at 3am on a Saturday. Which was all my fault but they could've handled it better! The hotel is well located, has good rooms with clean bathrooms and we enjoyed a wonderful central park view. Staff is efficient, but I would say rather on a distance than friendly.\\nAs it's not the cheapest hotel in the city, you'd expect to have at least one perk included, like a (small) breakfast, a drink downstairs, a day in the pool or the fitness, free wireless internet, ... but all of these services are fully priced. I know that's common for New York, but to pay for an hour of internet in your room is really not about the friendliness and customer service that is so passionately presented on their website. I brought my sister and family to New York for her first time and for her 60th birthday. We stayed 5 nights, received great room upgrades, and the front desk staff and the concierge were wonderful. On our last night, we got back to the hotel in a pouring rain and wanted a farewell night cap. The bar was closed because its ceiling had just collapsed so the front desk suggested a beer in the very downscale on-site hamburger joint. The staff there was very disorganized and rude. We tried to stand in line at the order window to get some beer and were told to sit down and wait for table service. We no one came to the table, we tried to get the attention of a waiter and were told we had to go back in stand in line at the order window. We ended up never getting served, and got no satisfaction when complaining to Food and Beverage Manager Aiske who was also unpleasant and ineffectual. The only choice left to us was a mini-bar drink in the room which was hardly a fitting birthday party. On top of that, only 2 of the 3 elevators serving the hotel's upper floors are in working condition, leaving us with 10 to 20 minute waits every time we wanted to go up or down. Upon checkout, the front desk person asked about my stay and said that considering our experience at the hamburger place the night before, he'd try to waive a $10 workout fee. He checked with the Front Desk Manager who denied the request. No attempt for remedy and quite unusually weak management for the Le Meridien standard!!l Fantastic location and overall nice hotel.\\nSome staff rude but I've been told that's just the way New Yorkers are.\\n Norma's food was amazing and the Burger Joint was spectacular....best burger ive ever had! I will preface this review by saying that I'm a frequent traveler to NYC, a platinum member of Starwood, and not a very big fan of NYC.\\nI arrived at the hotel right off a redeye flight. The check in was very efficient and courteous. The door men were helpful when asked. The front desk said that a room was ready so checked me in to a 10th floor room right next to the elevator facing north. As soon as I walked in, all I could hear was the construction site immediately to the north of the hotel (the hotel is between 56th and 57th street, but doesn't span the entire block). Immediately adjacent to the hotel is a construction site that looks like it's going to be going on for at least 9 months if not longer, and it's very loud.\\nI went and asked for a different room. There was none available so I left my name and number, put my luggage with the bell desk and went and got a massage. To their credit, they called me as soon as another room was available. They put me on a high floor with a beautiful view of Central Park.\\nI was at least 35 floors up, but will say that the noise was awful. More so than even other hotels in NYC (and I've stayed at several hotels in Times Square). I figured out that the noise during the day was from 1) the construction site and 2) 57th street. I constantly heard honking and sirens since 57th is a major east west street. The lack of double paned windows also doesn't help.\\nAdditionally, the high floors are serviced by 3 elevators. On two of my 5 night stays, I had to wait a good 8-10 minutes for an elevator. I (as well as all the guests waiting for me) found this to be unacceptable.\\nBut beyond the noise and the elevators, the views are great from the high floors, service very efficient, beds are comfortable, rooms are old but functional. The location is great as it's walking distance to almost anything you'd want to do in midtown (MoMA, Central Park, 5th Avenue, Times Square) and there is almost every bus or train that you'd need to take within a 7 minute walk.\\nI will definitely stay again if I'm going for business (meaning out of the hotel from 9-8 pm daily) but will find somewhere else to stay if on vacation. I like the style of the room. It's not super fancy but simple and neat. My room was also quite spacious for one person. The bad thing about the room is that it was a bit old. You could see scratches on the bathtub and the safety. The TV also looked very old and worked slowly, I had to wait for the TV to respond after pressing the button on the remote control. The A/C didn't work well, too. I gave up and turned it off. There was no coffee maker in the room, so I had to order a 16 dollar room service coffee the first morning. \\nThe location of the hotel is excellent, close to the central park and the subway stations. Stayed one night on a theater trip with family. Arrived at noon not expecting our rooms to be ready, but we were able to check in, anxious to get out on a beautiful Sat. afternoon and explore (our rooms were ready at 3 PM, a promised). We able to leave our bags with the bellman, which was great. My daughter needed to change, and we were directed to the fitness area one flight below the lobby. The three overly-made-up women in black tee's who were attending this massively busy area (one person using equipment) seemed flummoxed by this request. I don't know if the hotel operates the fitness center, but perhaps the lovely, friendly and professional front desk personnel could give these employees a few lessons in courtesy. Other than that our room on the 17th floor was quiet and comfortable, the bathroom adequate for our needs and very clean. No views, but we weren't in the room that long to require one. Enjoyed Central Park and some of the local sights. I would stay again. The hotel was a perfect location for a family trip to NYC with kids. Close to theater, the playgrounds in the park, and an indoor pool for a break from the city for the kids. The only big problem was the heat/AC. You cannot adjust it at all. The hotel can turn it \"on\" or \"off\" but that's it. The first night was a hot, sweatly one because we couldn't stop the heat from blowing. Not much sleep that night. The elevators were very, very slow, and the TVs in the elevators weren't working right, but the staff was nice, and the room (we had a suite) worked well for a family of 4. Bell staff was especially friendly. I recently returned from a 3 week business trip, and after concluding a business stay at the Hilton Garden Inn/Chelsea I wanted to stay in a nicer, more plush hotel for my weekend respite. I chose the Le Parker Meridien because I am a Starwood Platinum guest and because I'm not a big fan of the St. Regis in New York City. I also got a fantastic rate of $239 per night for a deluxe king room.\\nThe hotel is quite nice, and I would gladly stay there again. However, despite assurances there was effective air conditioning when booking and again on check-in, I was upgraded to a junior suite only to discover after several calls and a maintenance visit that the A/C hadn't even been turned on in the hotel yet! I was quite annoyed, and expressed significant displeasure to various managers. Eventually, I informed them they needed to find me a comparable room at another Starwood hotel with working A/C and at no additional cost--since the error was completely theirs in falsely advertising a/c for the property. (I require very cool temps in order to be comfortable and to fall asleep.)\\nAfter they did check and discover there were only 2 other Starwood properties with vacancies (it was Easter weekend), but that both similarly had not turned on their A/C, they offered to upgrade me to a suite for my trouble. I still informed them I would prefer a cooler room more than a suite, but since no other option seemed available, I took them up on their offer. A very nice manager took me to visit several suites, and I chose a smaller suite which faced Central Park with amazing views and didn't have morning sun to wake me/warm the room in the morning when I was more likely to be in the room. The manager also had 3 fans brought to my room, and called in to check on me after I was settled and again the next morning. All in all, considering the fact they could do nothing more, I was impressed with the hotel's attempts to salvage a bad situation. \\nMy upgraded suite was a wonderful room on the 31st floor, with a very spacious living room and a decent sized bedroom area separated by a revolving TV cabinet (which allowed TV viewing from either room/area). The bath was nice sized, as well. My view was wonderful, looking across Central Park.\\nI had great room service breakfasts, both of which were comp'd by the hotel due to the A/C issues, as well, and they also gave me some extra Starpoints for my trouble. The room service is expensive, of course, but this is New York--though I was spared that on my bill, fortunately. \\nAll in all, I would GLADLY stay again at this hotel--though I would need to ensure that they had turned on the A/C by the time of my visit for the change in season. If you do not require A/C to my degree, then I would highly recommend this hotel if you can get a rate as good as I had found. Service was obviously outstanding. They couldn't have done more to try to remedy the situation...and everyone was VERY obliging and friendly in trying to solve the problem. Obviously, I should never have been informed that the hotel HAD A/C when it didn't, but that wasn't the in-house staff's fault (except for the check-in agent who erred in telling me so). My son, Joey and I celebrated our birthdays at Le Parker Meridian NYC. We've been a few times before and always loved it, but this time was extra special- from birthday balloons to friendly staff to a quickly place burger order to a room with a view AND WHAT A VIEW!\\nThank you NYC and Le Parker Meridian. We'll be back. Nice hotel, very well located. Room was okay (bathroom a bit too small), with a wonderful view on Central Park; air conditioning needs to be improved. Room servce staff could be more kind and efficient when setting up a rollaway bed. Excellent bar and breakfast. Strange choices such as the barber shop in front of the elevators. We could not try the burger joint but the contrast with a 5 star hotel was astounding; probably overestimated. We've stayed several times at this hotel, and always had great service and a very good experience. The location is superior and rooms have been very clean. Front desk service is very efficient. Only downside as I see it is that they no longer provide a hot water kettle and coffee/tea service. With 2 entrances, it's easy to get going in the right direction. A wonderful bar is on the way to the 57th street exit, and there's a Starbucks right across the street (and a small Dean and Deluca outpost a few doors away) from the 56th street exit. A big thank you to the many on your staff who made our stay so comfortable. I booked over 20 rooms for a group of artists who were appearing at a show in Brooklyn. Everyone went out of the way to accommodate our needs, both individually and as a group. \\nWe would like to mention Reina and Yvonne who helped with all aspects of the rooms. Francesca, Nigel, and Robb at Knave who helped us solve an early morning catering problem and Lisa who helped with our evening event at the hotel. Everyone in the group had a most positive experience & was enthusiastic about all aspects of LPM. We look forward to our next stay with you. Everything was perfect. Had a clear view of Central Park on a prime floor! We stayed at Le Parker Meridien last year and I am finally getting around to reviewing it..\\nThe location of the hotel is great. A few blocks north of Times Square which is nice because it is central and because it is away from the busy area around the square.\\nThe staff was great and upgraded us for our Anniversary. The rooms were very well decorated and clean. I would highly reccomend! Great experience, the room was spacious, and he hotel staff was exceptional. Probably the best hotel I have stayed in new York. The breakfast was a must. Le Parker Meridien is a very nice hotel. The best thing about the hotel is the view, if you book a Tower view room. These rooms have amazing views of Central Park. The other great thing about this hotel is the location. It is only three blocks south of Central Park and in the middle of all the great shopping and not far from Times Square. There is also a Starbucks right across the street for you coffee addicts. The hotel has a fairly typical New York City style room. It is well appointed and fairly large. You won't find many hotels in New York with huge rooms, unless you want to pay a lot of money but Le Parker Merdien has larger rooms than the Hilton or Marriott and it is a much better hotel overall. I loved that the restaurant Norma's only serves breakfast and they serve it until 3pm. Very few hotels do this. I usually have to be down before 11am or I have to eat somewhere else. The breakfast was rated the best in NYC by Zagat and it is delicious. 7 other NYC restaurants also got this title in 2012. The portions are huge. Be prepared. My cheese omelette was the size of a toaster and they gave me ten pieces of bacon as my side. They also have a restaurant called the Burger Joint. Zagat also rated this and said it was the best burger in New York City. I didn't have it since the line was too long and we were doing other things but it looks delicious. They are one of the few hotels with a beautiful indoor pool on the roof. It is on the 42nd floor and, if you like to swim or your kids want to play, this is a great hotel for them. They just opened a new spa downstairs where women can get blowouts only and men can get shaves and haircuts. The hotel is also animal friendly. I brought my dog, Lola and she was treated very well and welcomed at the property. The bathrooms are fairly small, so if you want a huge bathroom, this is not your place. It is quiet. You don't hear your neighbors when you're in the room. Our room had a huge, brand new plasma TV. When I was there, they told me they will soon be renovating all the rooms, so there could be some changes when you get there. The hotel is a big hotel, so give yourself about ten minutes to get down to the lobby via the elevator. On one trip it stopped at 15 floors and we were in there for about 10 minutes. It wasn't anything terrible and only happened once because it was a holiday weekend. If you want to be in a great location at a very nice hotel that doesn't break the bank but is much more classy than a Hilton or Marriott, stay here. Excellent chioce for New York... Slightly pricey, but close to Time Square and all the action in NYC.... close to subway, as well as 5 minute walk to tour bus routes.... An excellent choice when staying in NYC... Rooms were clean, with good beds, and a large bathroom and shower made it s truly joyous stay. \\nStaff were very friendly, and it helped to have a Starbucks directly across from the hotel :) , especially in the cold winters that NYC experiences\\nWould definitely go back Look, when I rate this as good, I'm rating it as good by the standards of relatively upscale hotels in New York City. I would choose to stay here over most other hotels, but it also has some drawbacks that you should be aware of, and which mean that given the choice of the W or other similar upscale hotel, I would go there. We got a junior suite upgrade, which was appreciated, but felt somewhat off-put when they offered us a nicer suite if we would pay for an upgrade. We had two SPG Ambassador Platinum members in a room, which, should have qualified for best available room, so we kind of felt like they were fudging the SPG rules. In our room, there were a couple of glaring issues which the hotel failed to remedy. First, the bathroom sink barely drained, which the cleaning staff had to be aware of, but which was not fixed. Second, the Air Conditioning was not sufficient to actually cool the room - there was cold air coming out of both units but not in sufficient volume to make any difference, which was annoying, and adversely impacted my quality of sleep. Last, the bathrobe hanging in the bathroom had a big stain on it when we got there. I would really think that the cleaning staff would have noticed this and changed it out, but they never did. We left glasses from the bar in our room one night and the cleaning staff placed them outside our door the next morning, but they sat there for almost 24 hours before being collected even as other room service ware nearby was collected. The robe and glassware led me to conclude that the attention to detail that one might expect from such a hotel was somewhat lacking. One other thing to be aware of, especially for business travelers, is that this hotel has far too few elevators for the number of guests and during busy times the wait for the elevator is long (5+ min), elevator rides stop at every floor, and the elevators become uncomfortably packed full of people. \\nThe lobby bar is really nice if a bit short on seating, and the restaurant has great breakfast, but make reservations in advance. The hotel has a private gym in the basement that SPG platinum gets free use of, and this is quite possibly one of the best hotel gyms I've ever used. It is a two story gym with lots of cardio equipment and a lot of machines and free weights with ample floor space. All in all, I'd happily stay there again, but didn't have such a great experience that I will go out of my way to do so, which many Meridien hotels have provided me. Drop dead view from 33rd floor over central park. Rooms are a little threadbare, but that view makes up for a lot. Food is great but a little expensive. Cafe pulls a good espresso. Stayed four four days. Had problems with the room being too warm, no AC!!! Very noisy, with construction and garbage collection going on because we had to leave the windows open (3 inches, big whoop!) No atmosphere in lobby area, very cold. Would not stay there again!!!! This is a nice hotel. Bed was comfortable. Room service was prompt. There's a barber shop on the lobby floore, and that's helpful if you're there on business. The hotel is within walking distance to Columbus Circle, Times Square, Central Park, 5th Avenue. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. We requested a room with a view of Central Park and they were able to accommodate us. The only issue I had was the street noise, and we were on the 31st floor. I think they could invest in some better windows. I might not have noticed the noise so much, but we'd just come from a hotel in Barcelona where there was zero street noise even on the 6th floor. Great staff. Well accomodating. Hotel is missing a few key items to make it great. We stayed here with our children (5 and 1) last weekend and it was great. We were upgraded to a larger room on a higher floor and the crib we requested was waiting in the room for us. The location was perfect as it was close to all of the things we wanted to do in NYC as a family. We heard that the hotel had the best burgers in town (there was a line up for the restaurant every time we passed the lobby) and were delighted to find out that we could place the order from our room and easily pick it up without lining up (which we did). We had a smooth check in and check out. The staff was friendly. I don't have anything negative to say about our stay or the hotel .. just wish we got to stay longer! I wasn't aware that there were any kids activities other than the little booklet and crayons they give when you check in which is why I gave it an average rating. We travel to NYC once or twice a year to visit our daughter, and always stay at the Parker Meridien. The location is perfect, especially for runners like us who love Central Park. The staff are extremely helpful, the rooms are clean and comfortable. The ONLY thing I would say is that if the bathrooms were just a bit bigger, it would be a lot easier to share with my husband! :) We were super excited about the renovation to the fitness center and the addition of the Dry Bar (for blow outs). The burgers at the Burger Joint really are the best ever, and Norma's has an amazing brunch (albeit expensive). I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I always enjoy myself staying there. Many sweet small things accumulates and make a big difference. The staff are firendly and remember my preferences as a regular customer, well abort of. We were worried about bed bugs and cleanliness after reading so many bad reviews re NYC hotels. This was not the case with Parker Meridien. The level of cleanliness is outstanding and the housekeeping staff made sure to work around our needs, even if we decided to sleep in late. The concierge staff was always friendly and patient, trying to help us with whatever we needed and offering advice when asked. We felt as if we the hotel home. This is one hotel to which we will be returning. EVERYTHING was top notch from the check in women, Gold Upgrade to a FANTASTIC room by NYC standards, Norma's (pricey but perfect!), and even the barbershop.\\nDid not have a single complaint which is rare for me. Check in was fine. They were suppose to call us when our room was ready and never did. We went up and found the room very very small. It was extremely warm in the room (72) so we put the air on and left for 5 hours. we came back and it was the same..called maintenance. She changed the filter and opened the windows. She also told us that the hotel sets the air at 65 and it won't go any lower...so why is there a thermostat and AC. We had to keep the windows opened a crack the 3 days we were there. We then went down to breakfast the next day at Norma's in the lobby. Highly expensive to say the least, not your normal breakfast to say the least. Could not get just eggs or french toast or pancakes, everything was gourmet and was made drowning in sugar, chocolate, fruit or all together. We got a phone call and had to leave, our server charged us $12 for a glass of OJ and $7 for a cup of coffee and you can't fight city hall. I was disgusted from then on and did not drop a cent in that hotel. If you want an awesome breakfast good old fashion type with huge servings go to Ellens Stardust diner on 52nd and Broadway. It is an easy 4 block walk from the Parker. The servers take turns singing since they are waiting to get on Broadway and the food is 5 STAR and the prices are $8 - 9 for a huge breakfast.\\nBeds are rather uncomfortable and the pillows were awful...i find Courtyard's way above this hotel. I don't know how people are saying comfy platform beds and updated rooms because that is not what we got! The view from the \"park view\" room was really fantastic. We also loved the contemporary stile decoration of the hotel; there was nothing dated, there was nothing old or even consumed. Staff was kind and polite, specially at the check-in. The mnaintenance of the cleanliness of the room was perfect, the bed clothes was always very clean and smelling so well... The location speaks for itself. Having the Burger Joint\" just downstairs was a real bonus. The only reason I didn't rate \"excellent\" is that the heater of the room was not working. Since it was not so cold we just slept under the duvet and did not even communicate the problem to the staff. We will surely stay there again and recommend it to all. Our long weekend at the Meridien was perfect. The staff was very helpful, finding us an accessible room at check-in (not easy to do at 3 in the morning!). The location couldn't be better... an easy walk to Central Park. A bit longer walk to the Theatre district. We found very good restaurants in the immediate neighborhood. The Burger Joint was fun at 11pm, and the burger was good, but I'd pick a time that you don't have to wait in line for your burger. The room was perfect for us, a very comfortable stay. The TV on a pole was the only thing that was quirky about the room. View of the park,close to the subway that takes you to Chelsea, meatpacking district & cool shopping. Easy walk to MOMA, inexpensive taxis rides to great, safe neighbourhoods.Loved our comy platform bed and updated nyc style room. Will use the pool next visit. What a view! The Meridien is our hotel of choice in NYC. The combination of location, amenities, food and workout/spa is decisive. Service is smooth and discreet, as well. Parker is great. \\nSuper location by the subway and the park. Front desk is cheerful but chill. Heard the gym was baller but ran in the park instead. Toiletries are nice.\\nOnly bad thing: Tv's in rooms are from 1995 A great place to stay, and centrally located. We took our teens, 13 and 16. They especially loved the Burger joint. We had 2 Jr. suites, and they were spacious and comfortable. Our teens, a boy and a girl had a pull out Queen and a King bed, and we let them have the suite with the larger bathroom. We did not have time to use the roof top pool, but what a great feature and great view! We booked our room with Priceline and got a great rate. The room was large, well furnished and quiet. The lobby was clean and the service was excellent. The hotel is close to shopping, museums and Central Park. It was a short walk to Penn Station and Times Square. Very upscale with a modern flare. No coffee maker in the room, but did have a flat screen TV and water glasses and the bed was comfortable. I can't comment on the stay before summarizing perhaps the most chaotic and irritating reservation experience I've ever had. My daughter was performing with a choir at Carnegie Hall and the hotel was convenient. I reserved a room for her and my wife in my wife's name for Wednesday night checking out Sunday. I was going to join them on Friday and reserved a second room in my own (different last) name, all with sub-$300 AAA rates- decent for the neighborhood. \\nThat was all fine, until they decided to arrive on Thursday instead. When I tried to change the date on the web site, the price jumped to $800. I decided that was insane and that human beings wouldn't stand for it, so I called the reservation line, where, after several minutes repeating that I did not want to move the whole reservation back a day but shorten it by a day, the agent said she couldn't fix it, put me on hold for about 5 minutes, then came back and told me that the hotel manager had made the change and kept the same rate, and also that she had requested connecting rooms as I'd asked. I thanked her and forgot about it for a while, but for some reason became concerned a few days later. I called the reservation line again and was told the reservation had not been changed and again got put on hold for 5 minutes and again was told it would be taken care of.\\nI figured things were fine until I got a pre-arrival e-mail still showing the original arrival date and I hit the roof. I called the hotel this time and they said there was a notation in the reservation saying the date should be changed but that nobody had actually made the change. They said not to worry and changed the date.\\nThe next, day, my wife arrived, her reservation was fine, but no accommodation had been made for connecting rooms and that the clerk was insisting that nothing could be done about it. She called me from the front desk and I had to get on the phone with the clerk and have her get the manager. Apparently, the notation for connecting rooms had neglected to mention who to connect to. The manager understood that it was unlikely that I had asked for a room connecting to some unknown party and that it was clearly their mistake, and though it was impossible to connect at that point that we could be next door and could check out at 4PM with no charge. \\nOnce we got there the hotel was fine. New York hotels are allowed a certain quirkiness that would not be tolerated in less concentrated environments, and ours is no exception. With the advent of flat screens, the hotel took advantage of the opportunity to wall mount the TVs and eliminate the bulky furniture underneath. This leaves the rooms feeling almost expansive, with generous space between the end of the bed and the opposite wall. It also leaves the room without any place to store one's clothes, if one is inclined to unpack. My room had one small drawer to the right of the desk and a shelf to the left. That's it. But you do get the expansive feel and a wall that really looks like there should be a piece of furniture there, especially because there are no less than 3 sets of electrical outlets that were probably useful when TV was sitting on the dresser.\\nThe beds were fine, there's an odd paucity of glasses and no fluffy robes, and the faucets in the bathroom are set about 1/4 too far back, so if you have the water on low pressure it lands on the counter instead of in the sink. Overall, though, I found it a pleasant, convenient place to stay. It's close to multiple subway lines and has 3 Starbucks, a Dean and Deluca cafe and a well-stocked fancy grocery store all within a block or so. I would certainly stay there again. This is the fourth time that I have stayed here on business and it is a most fabulous hotel. I have been upgraded twice to a junior suite, which was spacious and cool. It is always pristine and the staff who service the rooms are very friendly and accommodating. \\nThe breakfast/ brunch has one of the best menus that I have seen. I have eaten the Eggs Benedict with porcini mushroom sauce and the rock lobster and grilled asparagus omelet. Both were amazing, but be aware that potion size is BIG. Unfortunately only 30% of bookings are reserved for hotel guests, which did not impress. However, after some strong words, I got a reservation at a convenient time. Waiting time on a weekend is generally 45-60 minutes, so it is worth booking ahead. \\nThe hidden burger joint by the reception does amazing burgers. Look for the neon burger sign or the queue of people waiting to get inside. \\nThe bar is perfect for an evening drink before hitting the town, star spotting is not uncommon. I have seen Matt Dillion casually stroll through. impersonal and over priced, not a 4 star hotel, more like a 3 star. $17.00 for internet access, no robes, no water glasses, no flat screen TV. Bedding? you'll find better at a 2 star hotel. The rooftop pool is pretty cool though, that lessened the pain of my one night there. Moved to another hotel for the rest of our NYC visit. Rooms are small and dated. Hotel charges extra for EVERYTHING (toothbrush, gym, pool). Thermostats in the rooms don't work and you have to call front desk to send up an engineer to adjust the temperature. View of central park for the room I had was very nice. The hotel was absolutely beautiful from the lobby, to the hallways, to the rooms. We had a gorgeous view on NYC from our room. It is a perfect location...only 2 blocks from Central Park and close to many great restaurants and bars. The staff was so nice and helpful, especially the concierge Emily Achilles. I travel a lot and there are a few things that are really important to me when on the road: sleep, location, and food. At Le Parker Meridien the beds and pillows are great and I always get a good night's sleep there (have stayed here 3-4 times). The hotel location is fantastic, just a few blocks from the park, theatres, Times Square (but not too close, which is nice). The staff is fabulous, Norma's restaurant & room service menu is one of the best in the country (another great one that comes to mind is the Kimpton in Seattle), and Parker Meridien room service workers are always willing to make whatever changes you want to the menu items. They also willingly suggest components to go with your desired menu changes. Many hotels do not like to stray from the menu more than a little. \\nSo this place sort of makes my travel life better. And that's pretty valuable. Hotel was in a fantastic location; a short walk to Central Park, Times Square and Rockefeller Center. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was very pleased with the cleanliness of the room and the room size. Emilie Achilles helped check me in and she was fabulous! I would absolutely return to this hotel when visiting the city next! Firstly, let me begin by saying I have Platinum status with Starwood so I have stayed at quite a few different hotels in New York.\\nWhen I reserved I booked a room with a King however when I arrived they could only provide a room with two doubles. They would not upgrade me to another room that had a King, nor compensate me in anyway for the inconvenience. \\nThe room they gave me had soaking wet carpet next to the window. Since the room is small I had to be careful where I placed my things. This is one of the more expensive hotels in the area, and this ranks in as the worst hotel experience I've ever had. \\nThere are plenty of hotels in NYC, skip this one. Apart from a very good business hotel. This hotel also serves special and best Breakfast in New York City that you can't find it in other hotels. But you may have to wait in line as this restaurant is too popular. The location is Great and it is only 2 blocks away from the 5th Avenue and Apple Store. The Gym is very well equipped too and the staffs in Gym are very helpful ! I ventured into Manhattan to see my cousin's daughter perform at Carnegie Hall. Le Parker Meridien is right down the block and a very convenient place to stay. For the most part I enjoyed my four night stay. I stayed in a Junior Suite and it was nice. The bed was firm but it could have used a nice thick mattress pad. The pillows were flat and uncomfortable. The windows opened, which was nice in the evenings. However, garbage trucks collected trash across the street until about midnight. After that, the nice cool evening air felt really nice. I'm sure rooms on much higher floors would not have experienced the noise factor. That said, my family and I didn't spend too much time in the room on the trip so I'd say it was a minor inconvenience. The only other issue we experienced with the hotel was that there were some dirty/used glasses left on the floor in the hall just outside the room across from ours for THREE DAYS, even though housekeeping promptly cleaned our room each afternoon. They were promptly removed by someone after we informed the front desk.\\nThe rooftop pool was very nice. It was clean, warm (good for a few cool nights) and a decent size. The views of Central Park and the surrounding city were spectacular. You should be aware that pool access costs an additional $15 per room for each day that you choose to use it.\\nRafael at the Concierge desk was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful in arranging a dinner reservation for me for the evening on which my family and I arrived. As I had never been in New York before, I asked him to recommend an italian or seafood restaurant that serves really good food and withing walking distance of the hotel. He even made the reservation for me. His recommendation was enjoyed tremendously. We won't stay anywhere else when we venture into the city. Both children love the hotel (also our dog Bella loves the hotel) Spotless, great service, the Burger Joint, great location. We were surprised by the $15 pool use fee per day. A new fee that has been implemented. We didn't see it on the website nor did the front desk tell us about it. The use of the pool should be complimentary. Love love love Le Parker Meridien on 56th in NYC. Great service, lovely new rooms, European feel, great location - all wonderful. Can't wait to go back. I had a terrific stay at the Parker Meridien. This was my second stay. I had booked a room with a king sized bed, but at the time of my check-in, there were no rooms with king sized beds available. As a result, they upgraded me to a junior suite. Although I've noticed that some of the reviews reference older tv, carpeting and lamp fixtures--the room that I stayed in was newly renovated. There was a flat screen tv, modern light fixtures and a really nice bathroom.\\nOn my first stay during the winter, there was a fair amount of construction noise from a near-by hotel, but this construction has been completed, and all is once again quiet. \\nThe location of the hotel is excellent for business travelers who are visiting midtown Manhattan. It's also a great place for tourists who may be visiting New York, particularly if you're interested in taking advantage of being so near Central Park. (It's very easy to go for an early morning run in the park). The hotel is also centrally located near several different subway lines, which should make getting around New York City significantly easier. Also, the hotel is near many different restaurants and more informal eateries, so those there are many options at different price points. I was first introduced to this hotel when I made an appearance on the \"CBS Early Show\" several years ago. CBS made the initial decision to put me up there but I have eagerly made it my hotel of choice ever since! Great location, spotless rooms and amenities, and wonderfully comfortable king size beds! The Burger Joint downstairs is great! A flower waited at the door, a great view on Central Park waited inside the room. Great service and smiles all over. I got my room on Priceline for $128 plus taxes. I wanted two beds so I emailed guest relations and they were able to confirm two-beds with no issues. At check-in I asked for a view of Central Park and again, no issues. The room was large, the beds were over-sized twin beds, but very clean and comfortable. The bath amenities are Peter Thomas Roth, and the towels are chunky and fluffy. The service from multiple staff, from front desk to bell desk was lovely. You can enter/exit the hotel from 56th or 55th. If anything can be improved it's the old TV, carpeting and some lamp fixtures, which were rusty and had seen better days. This hotel is in a great location a couple of blocks away from Central Park South. The room was spotless and looked recently updated, as did the whole floor we were on as well as the lobby. I was happily surprised to see Peter Thomas Roth products in the bathroom. First time I ever saw that anywhere. Bed was very comfortable and the sheets were so soft. The only complaint I had was that even though there were a few different options for which kind of pillow to use, none of them were comfortable. Lovely hotel with very comfortable rooms with great bar and restaurants on site and a superb pool. The staff were excellent and very attentive but be warned you have to pay to use the gym which is the only negative point about the hotel We still love this hotel and were happy to hear that they are taking the hint to renovate their dated televisions and rooms. They are up to floor 9 as of 3/10/2012 and are working their way up. They also completes some renovations to the pool area- new flooring and new floor to ceiling windows. However, it will cost you! As of February, they now charge $15 EACH DAY you use the pool per room. I found this to be a tough pill to swallow as we stay here regularly and it had been free to all guests prior to these renovations. They have been also adding other vendors such as a nail salon and \"dry bar\" for hairstyling in the basement- where I, admittedly, have never been. Beware of the prices listed on the mini bar too- I was charge $9.25 for a Heinekin that was on the menu for $8.50. Overdue renovations should not be reason to make your guests feel ripped off. Great location; walking distance to all the hot spots. The Parker team is incredible - down to earth, fun, knowledable & polite. Hotel was spotless - the take personal responsibility for keeping the hotel looking good. Inclusive - the pool is in the penthouse of the hotel on the 41st floor offering an amazing view of the city; it's great that they made the penthouse common space so all guests can enjoy the view (wish we didn't have to pay $10/15 to use the hotel though). The rooms are spacicous - lots of living space. I lived in the NYC area for 12 years so I know the city well. This was one of my first trips back and one of my first opportunities to stay in a NYC hotel. What a great experience it was. The staff at Le Parker Meridien is amazing. From the kind folks at the front desk to the concierge staff to the luggage guys, all were great! I would definitely stay here again on another trip to the city. Highly recommended!! We stayed at the Parker Meridien for two nights and had a wonderful time right in the center of NYC. The staff was always very friendly and helpful - especially when we requested a room as far away from th elevators as possoble. We had a great view on Central Park and we will definitely return on our next trip to the Big Apple. We love the Parker-Meridien! Great location, room, service, food and even (for NYC) the rates! We eagerly look forward to our next visit. I have always had pretty good service here and stay here at least once a year when I need to be near the theatres or Central Park. I have never had a problem with my Starwood Gold benefits. The burger joint in the hotel is a popular destination; there are also other good spots within a few blocks. I like the habitual efficiency of LPM, its location and good food. When possible, I make it a point to stay here. There are a lot of fine hotels in Manhattan but what sets this hotel apart is the service. I was traveling with my wife, six month old son and our nanny. The connecting rooms were ready upon checkin, the room service was quick, and the PM desk shift was EXTREMELY generous with a late checkout. So generous - in fact - that I won't post the time. I have stayed at a lot of other large hotels in NY and Las Vegas - were you feel like a number - The staff here went above and beyond to ensure that you felt like a valued guest. Thanks! Rating:\\nIt's in a great central location for both arts, entertainment and shopping. The rooms are quite small, but this is NYC after all, so that's the norm... The decor is quite dark and mainly brown, a tad boring. The bed is nothing to get excited about. They also charge for Internet (although it's very fast!). And not only that, it's also per device and not just by room.... So it's a 3 for me. \\nTheir saving grace is their wonderful staff!\\nLocation:\\nCan't really ask for better! So close to everything exciting theatre, arts, concerts, shopping.....\\nRoom:\\nHad a junior suite facing the city. The room is substantially larger than a regular king room.\\nThere are two ways to go about the rooms. You can either have a smaller room, but with a central park view. Or a larger room facing the other direction.\\nThe bed was firm and boring. It also had no bathtub, but a large walk-in shower. Even if you do go for a room with a bathtub, please be aware that they are very small....\\nNice Peter Thomas Roth amenities. It could be reasonably darkened out at night and we couldn't hear too much traffic.\\nIt's also very clean\\nStaff:\\nThey're lovely and very helpful. I can't say enough great things about the concierge team!!\\nFood: \\nBreakfast is nothing special, but acceptable. They do have a fantastic hamburger place right next o the lobby though. \\nInternet:\\nGgrrrr this is one of my travel pet peeves.... Why in this day and age do hotels still charge for Internet??? And especially when it's not just per room, but per device!!! We all (almost anyways) travel with a laptop, iPad and smart phone and need to be able to hook up all of our toys without getting fleeced!\\nIt was however veeeeery fast, which is always nice!\\nA/C:\\nThis was a tad annoying. The room was really too warm, but there was no way to cool it as they don't turn on their AC system until later on in the year.... I truly enjoyed my stay here. My wife and I came in the middle of february with our 6 year old daughter who had never been to NY before. I was impressed the second I got out of the car. the doormen were incredibly nice helped us find a cheaper place to park than the hotel parking lot. The people at the front desk were very acomodating sasha in particular gave us an upgrade to a junior suite after there was a problem with our daughter not being on the reservation. the room was nice and spacious for NYC. \\nWe ate at the Burger joint our first night and really enjoyed it the burgers are great and the attitude of the place was really cool and hip, hidden away in the corner. \\nNorma's was our breakfast destination of choice and everyone is right about what they say great food the only downside being that on sunday there was a long wait so we decided to go somewhere else\\nThe pool has its ups and downs. While the pool itself is astounding from the views, to the pool itself. the fact that there is a charge is truly cheap and annoying. I was paying a lot of money to stay in the hotel and yet the hotel deemed it necessary to charge 15$ to use the pool for the day, ridiculous. Even with the charge we used the pool every day and the staff there was as incredible as everywhere else. The lifeguards are all great, I forgot his names but the redhead lifeguard was great remembering us every time and lending my daughter goggles, noodles, and a bunch of pool toys. \\nthe basement was somewhat under construction which was a little annoying because it took away from my using of the gym but the staff was incredibly accomadating and the on staff trainer, greg, was helpful and helped me out with the machines. the equipment there is all top notch and there are cool little computers that track your workout.\\nThe concierge was really good helped us out with shows and restaurants.\\nIf I was rating this hotel just on the amenities the ranking would probably be a bit lower but the staff from the front desk to the pool was some of the best i have encountered. I will definitely be coming back Location is close to many things and to subway stops. Just a few blocks to Central Park. Construction is going on nearby. Beginning at midnight on a Friday night in February there was heavy work going on. The front desk said they weren't aware it was going to happen that night and offered to move me if it was continuing the next night. They said they would call me to let me know the status of the construction, but they never did and would not answer calls to the front desk. Luckily there was no more construction during the weekend. We stayed in a junior suite with our 14 year old and 4 year old. It was on the smaller side compared to other suites I have stayed in, and more expensive. Pros - the staff was very friendly and accommodating to our requests, very clean room, room service was great, breakfast at Norma's was fantastic, and location is very close to Central Park. We were also given a later checkout at no additional charge. Cons - an additional $15 charge per room per night to use the pool, and difficult time making the room cooler (in this hotel, as in most NYC hotels, in the winter central heat is used, and the only way to cool off a room is to open a window - which presents a hazard to young children as there is no screen). I received excellent service from Lamiaa at concierge, and from Majda at frot desk.\\nThey were bot outstanding, patient and very efficient.\\nTheir performance must be recognized. The location is great, the check-in and check-out were fast and efficient. But nothing really special. \\nI think I was \"punished\" for asking for a quiet room on a higher floor, because when I said I wasn't interested in paying an extra $50/day for my pre-booked prepaid room (thru Expedia), I got stuck with a low floor, in the closest possible room to the elevator, LOL. I know asking for upgrades is always a crapshoot, and I am always polite, not demanding (I figure it never hurts to ask!), so that's fair--whatever, LOL. \\nOur room overlooked the massive construction site next door, but fortunately the site was stalled the 3 nights we stayed. (But keep in mind, that project is massive and will probably be going on much of the year. It may get LOUD, as others have noted.)\\nThe basic, king-bed room we stayed in was fine: very comfortable firm bed, no bedbugs, Philip Thomas Roth bath products.\\nThe hotel has an okay (not great) rooftop swimming pool, but it costs an extra $15 per family, per day, to use it (new policy implemented February 2012, although it's not on their website and the in-room facility description still lists the pool as complimentary). We went at night--nice city lights, looks like there's a nice deck for when the weather is nicer. But the pool itself is teensy, maybe 17 or 18 metres from end to end, about 5 metres across. The water quality was not great (and I say this as a certified lifeguard): very turbid and cloudy. I went in with my kid but we took soapy showers afterward. The lockerrooms adjoining the pool deck are great--filled with bath products and they have hair dryers so you could, in theory, get ready for dinner here (as we did) after our swim.\\nAll in all, it was okay-but-not-great. The parking cost $50/day, no in-out privileges.\\nArchitecturally, the lobby is very pretty, as is Nave, the onsite coffeeshop.\\nWould I stay again? Maybe. Dunno. It was all in all a very underwhelming experience, though not terrible either. Great place....excellent location...great staff....very nice rooms .....great bar lounge... I tried already a few Hotels around Times Square (New York) until I found the Le Parker Meridien. In my opinion it is an excellent choice for both business and leisure traveler. Friendly staff, speedy check in and check out, a good breakfast to start your day…what you want more…? I can only recommend this Hotel! Really great stay all round... Great room, great pool, great breakfasts at Normas really friendly and charming staff fantastic location- walk all day and night to Central park, theater district and Times Square, zillions of restaurants and attractions. Very adequate room size considering you are in midtown Manhattan. Accomodations are very modern with clean and updated bathrooms, furniture, etc. 2 great food spots inside the lobby- Norma's for incredible brunch and the delicious hamburger joint known city-wide. Hotel guests receive special attention at these busy restaurants. We had a junior suite and an adjoining room. Which worked out for 3 kids and 3 adults. Great rooftop pool, but why charge for it? Good burger joint called the knave. Very convenient that we could rent a stroller, would definitely return for another stay perfect location near central park/5th ave/rockefeller centre.\\nsubway at end of street made it easy to get around the rest of manhattan.\\nbest burger joint in hotel lobby\\nroom had a view of central park Hotel has a great location. Rooms are clean and have a decent size (for NYC)\\nBathroom very small but ok.\\nConstant background noise in the room even though the thermostat was off.\\nWifi is expensive\\nStay away from Norma's to have breakfast, Too expensive , average of $35 per person. I've never written a review of a hotel, though I rely on TripAdvisor all the time. I've chosen to write because of the terrible customer service that I received here and the ridiculously outdated rooms that are straight from the 1960s. In addition, the bellmen damaged my laptop while it was in storage for the afternoon.\\nThis hotel is not up to SPG standards. Overall, great ambience and most of the staff were also excellent. Location was superb.\\nRoom was very well finished and stylish. Good size for NYC.\\nMy only issue would be that for a quality hotel (and it is not the cheapest), I would expect seamless service and facilities. Not having complimentary wifi throughout was a big disappointment for me (my travel agent told me it was) and also paying for the swimming pool. Would suggest the hotel doesn't try and squeeze out every last dollar and instead concentrate on providing a great overall package... Awesome hotel. Close to transport. Great dining optioms on site. Comfortable bed, attentive staff. Cant complain at all! Would pay a lot more to stay here again! Got room throgh priceline. it was a steal. We stayed here for 5 nights in February and although we had a great time there were a few things that made this hotel average rather than good. By far the best thing about this hotel is it's location; many main tourist attractions are within walking distance. We were given a room on the 27th floor on the 56th street side of the hotel. The room was quiet, due to it being at the end of the corridor and we had good views over the city. However, the room was on the small side and although clean, felt a little dated. The bathroom was fairly compact, but modern and again very clean. The biggest problem was that the room was very warm, whatever setting the heating was on. It did get slightly uncomfortable at night sometimes. As we didn't complain to the hotel when we were there I do feel a bit guilty about including this in the review as maybe they would have fixed this if we had asked. However, I have noticed this point in other reviews which is why I have decided to include it.\\nOn our last night at the hotel we decided to go and use the pool on the top floor, which is described in the hotel's in-room guide as being \"free to guests staying in the hotel\". It was also one of the reasons we chose to book this hotel in the first place. On arriving upstairs we were informed that the hotel had changed it's policy and have now started to charge guests of the hotel to use the facilities! We politely told the poor guy on the desk (who looked relieved that we weren't going to start shouting at him) that this was not acceptable as at the time of booking this wasn't the case/no information about this in room etc. After a few minutes he decided to let us in for free, but did inform us that this would only happen once. \\nThe pool was initially quite pleasant, but as I swam around did notice a couple of Elastoplast in one of the filters at the side of the pool and so decided to get out! The changing rooms made up for this slightly though as they had nice products to use and were very clean. The staff were also very friendly and the views from the pool area are great day or night. After our swim we decided to eat the takeout we had brought back earlier, but of course we hadn't got any cutlery. When we requested some we were told that there would be a $5 room service charge, which we did feel was a little cheeky! We probably would have given this amount as a tip anyway, but were told that there was no way round this charge. We decided to be slovenly and eat with our fingers.\\nI'll end on a compliment - the staff here are lovely and are always ready with a smile and good morning/afternoon. There are plenty of staff at the front desk, so check in would always be quick. Housekeeping do a great job and our room was cleaned by 11 am each day. They work really hard, but I think that sometimes hotel 'policy' seems to limit the service they are able to give. + localization!!!!\\n+ good burgers in the restaurant behind the curtains next to reception desk\\n- small room\\n- quite old hotel (should be renovated!!!) not like 5 stars hotel\\n- small swimming pools Le Parker Meridian has a lot of things going for it, including location, lobby ambience and a Starbucks across the street. But it also feels confused about whether it's a glorified Marriott or a discount Sofitel. My junior suite featured a lot of veneers and bold wall colors, and was reminiscent what was breakthrough design in the mid-90s--and the rotating, full-size TV cabinet is looking pretty dated. The bathroom, however, was outstanding. Wonderful central location, close to 5th Ave, Central Park, Times Square, etc... The room was comfortable with a great view of Central Park. \\nMy only negative remark would be about their business center which was just 2 computers at the end of the hallway with printer, copy and fax machine, all paid service. \\nWe had problems to print some important documents we needed and Ms Anandi (front desk) was very accommodating and professional in helping us use another wifi printer and bringing us the papers personally. \\nThe staff was attentive and excellent. We particularly enjoyed the hotel initiative to place a tv screen in the elevator showing old Tom & Jerry cartoons and Charlie Chaplin films. It got the guests laughing and talking to one another all the time. Nice touch.\\nWill definitely come again. My New York office is a block and a half from Le Parker, so it's sort of my home away from home. From the first time I stayed here (many years ago, because the Hilton was oversold and put me up here) to today, the staff has consistently exceeded my expectations. Today, I worked in the room until 2 PM, yet when I came back tonight, the room was completely made up with new sheets. No annoying calls (I'm talking to you, Westin Las Vegas), no surprise of a messy room when I came back (I'm talking to you, both Swan and Dolphin Westins at Disney World). Every time I come to Le Parker, the staffing at the front desk is both sufficient enough so I don't have to wait 20 minutes (I'm talking to you, W Times Square) and friendly enough that they can snap me out of the irateness I feel after typical flight delays, instead of trying to pick a fight (I'm talking to you, Sheraton New York). The elevator wait is never unreasonable (I'm talking to you, Flatotel), and the location doesn't require a 3-mile walk (I'm talking to you, Ink48). The only place in Midtown with similarly good service is the Michelangelo, but it's often costlier and they don't have any meaningful rewards program. The rooms themselves are clean and modern, if a tiny bit dated at this point, but the upkeep and service more than make up for this. If you get an odd numbered room on floor 25 or higher, the Central Park views are breathtaking. In the years I have been coming here, they have never pissed me off, which is amazing because most hotels manage to do so in a single stay. I will keep coming back! The Parker Meridien consistently delivers a high quality service, room and experience, all set in a great European Inspired blend of function and design. Great location, great service, and great ambiance. 3rd year enjoying location, park view, Norma's for breakfast Hotel staff is very nice. Hotel hallways were quiet and the room was very comfortable. Great water pressure in the shower, fluffy towels, nice heavy sheets. The windows are very well insulated so the street noise is not disturbing\\nThe hotel is within walking distance to Central Park, Broadway, etc. Been coming to this hotel for over 16 years on business. Its a great hotel in a good location if you need to be in mid-town. The Burger Joint in the lobby is nice if you can get in, if not 5 Guys is around the corner. The rooms are starting to look tired. The furniture in the rooms is looking beat up and the old TV's don't help. I would come back here but I hope they update the hotel soon. Le Parker Meridian is located in the heart of Manhatten just near the central park, it has great rooms and a nice resturant with good food. This is a nice place to stay if you are visiting the city as all places are accessible from here. It was an official tour but I completely enjoyed my stay here. It's Starwood so I wondered...\"like a W, a Westin, a Sheraton?\" None of those actually. And that's just fine. This hotel had great \"bones\" in its cross between old and new worlds. Gorgeous views of Central Park (ask for Tower Rooms). Capable and quietly elegant, but with some age wrinkles showing. The pool on the top floor seems a bit of a waste, better suited perhaps for a bar, but the pool attendant couldn't have been nicer. Strange to see Charlie Chaplin movies playing in the elevator...I missed the connection. Room modern and comfortable. Nice bath amenities. Even a grocery store -- a FULL regular grocery store -- only three blocks away. Steps from Central Park. If you want that location, this place would be hard to beat. One note: much has been made of the burger bar just off the lobby. Cult like status even. If you're hungry for a burger you can do much better. The room is divey and fun, they play the Ramones (edgy!), and the people working there are really nice and fun. I am picky about my burgers and I do not rank this one in my top ten. Shake Shack, Minetta Tavern, etc. all have this beat by a mile. If you have no time to go elsewhere...by all means. This is the second time we've stayed at the Meridien and we've enjoyed it both times, using it as a brief holiday to relax after traveling and before visiting family. I give it an excellent rating bc we use our starwood points and the hotel staff treats us just as attentively as they would their paying guests.\\nThe hotel staff is incredibly friendly, helpful and personable.. we got to know a few of the staff during our brief stay and it made the grand hotel feel cozier. Rooms felt spacious, beds are comfortable - having a view of the park is a treat. We used the newly renovated gym which was great. Close to everything and the location is perfect.. I used to live downtown so staying in the area close to the park feels like being on holiday while it's convenient to all the major subways. Nice room, ample by NYC standards, with great amenities and modern, comfortable, and very attractive furnishings. Nice midtown location. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Even the doormen tried to help us find affordable parking for guests that were visiting us at the hotel. The rooms were very clean and beautifully furnished. Bathroom modern and updated, very pretty. Bed very comfortable Room size very good, especially for a NY hotel. Wonderful location.\\nEnjoyed stay very much. This price is affordable in the middle of Manhattan. Even though we live in NY, we really enjoyed our \"stay-cation\" at the Parker Meridian. It was great to be mid-town and do \"touristy\" things and stay in a really nice hotel. Food was great - Burger Joint and room service for dinner and Norma's for breakfast. Hotel is super kid-friendly - even the elevators have cartoons playing. Really fun to swim in the middle of winter and view is outstanding from the pool. I definitely recommend. The Parker Meridian is a very good place to stay with children in NYC. Our daughters enjoyed the coloring books and crayons they were given when we checked in, as well as watching enjoyable, old cartoons in the elevators. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable, but slightly outdated. The pool and the view from the pool area is simply incredible. There are also great shopping and family friendly attractions conveniently located nearby. New York hotels are pretty expensive and can vary somewhat in quality. Le Parker Meridien is a good all round reliable hotel - not particularly special but it has a lot of things going for it.\\nThe location is very convenient, a block from Central Park and not far from the subway. The room size is decent though the bathroom is on the small side and the decor in need of freshening up. The gym is excellent - fantastic size and everything you could want including good classes and a huge free weights area.\\nThe breakfast at Normas is great though expensive (and very busy) so splash out there when you feel like it but if you want a simpler, much cheaper breakfast you can go to Dean & Delucas across the street Over the years I have stayed at many NYC hotels. Most are overrated! The Parker Meridian is a gem. Great value. Excellent guest relations - especially Lisa, Lawrence and the front desk team! And they are completing a renovation of the gym. Well located with access on both 56th and 57th makes it easy to head any direction. \\nI highly recommend the hotel when in NYC! I've been staying at this hotel for years and it just gets better and better. The rooms are large, comfortable and quiet, the staff is friendly and helpful and it is centrally located to everywhere I need to be when in Manhattan on business. Our first time, and a great experience. Nothing whatsoever to fault - clean as a whistle, friendly staff (from front desk to pool attendants), in the middle of everything location-wise, nice breakfast, nice bar (The Vault). Be sure to go to the pool for the view - Central Park is lovely from that altitude! I've enjoyed staying here for years - the rooms are nice, the staff is very helpful, the Burger Joint on ground level is really good, and a Norma's breakfast is fun and delicious. The pool on the roof is very nice, though they've now introduced a fee for it - makes me uncertain about using it. Victoria Barr at the Parker in New York was wonderful to work with. The entire staff did a great job and the Burger Joint is an added plus. Location was ideal for our trip. It was close to subways, Central Park and easy to get around. The eclectic hotel had a nice vibe. \\nWe would come there again! Good location and nice hotel. Nice restaurant, gym, and staff I have been staying at this property for the past three years and really only have great things to say about it. The staff is wonderful and you will realize this the minute you check-in. Everyone from the front desk, to the bellman, to the phone operators are pleasant and extremely polite. Emilie Anchilles has been my go to for everything and she has gone above and beyond to make the hotel feel like my home away from home. I have also worked with Lisa Thorpe and she too has been great. The location of the hotel is amazing, blocks from mid-town offices and during the warm months you're only two blocks away from the Park. They also just completely remodeled their gym \"Gravity\" and it looks great. I have stayed at a bunch of properties in NYC, but the Parker Meridien always has me coming back!! \\nTim M. Here is a great hotel with wonderful service, located in Midtown NY. Starting with the staff at the front desk, you'll be welcomed personally as I was by Edwin and Emily. Lisa Thorpe in guest relations is always available for special needs or request. No matter where you want to venture in NY, the Parker Meredian is close by. Try the Burger Joint in the lobby, a well known secret by New Yorkers as the best burger in the city. You could spend more on a room in NY but why? Central Park jog? Check.\\nConcert next door at Carnegie Hall? Check. \\nBusiness meetings at 30 Rock? Check.\\nShopping at Uniqlo? Check.\\nArt scene at MoMA? Check.\\nLive taping of The Daily Show? Check. \\nAll within walking distance.\\nOh and the staff was so attentive. \\nThe view from the hotel was great. The desk provided a great location for working. \\nThe room decorations are a bit dated. The infrastructure is starting to show its age (just slightly) but this is much better than the Sheraton Hotel and Towers or the Hilton. Not as nice as the W on Lexington, but not as expensive either. And the whole scene there is a bit pretentious. \\nOh, did I mention the lounge at Le Parker Meridien? Nice lounge. \\nGreat burger joint there in the lobby as well. \\nThat said, the restroom off the lobby leaves MUCH to be desired. \\nOverall very nice! It's a nice hotel. has some very cool features like the barber shop, top floor pool and a great burger bar just off the lobby. Rooms are stylish but could use a little upgrading in the bathroom dept. I will stay here again. As a frequent visitor to NYC I've come to enjoy the location and consistency this hotel offers. Although we used my husbands starwood miles to pay for this, the room we stayed in was awful, Talk about cheap and second class. Was awful, reminded me of an office block. Stains on the carpet, bed awful, so uncomfortable. There was building work going on when we got there which actually frustrating but didnt bother me that much, but annoyingly we did not get told when booked.\\nPerson who checked us in was great though.\\nHotel bar is also very disapointing, service slow and atmosphere none existent.\\nWould not stay again awful place and would not recommend. This was a nice hotel. I have nothing bad to say about it. The staff was friendly, and rooms were clean and comfortable. The rooms are a modern deco and large for New York. The bell staff were very friendly and took care of their guests. You do have to ask for the wifi access. If you don't pay for it an advance or have it in price, you will need to pay $17.00 a day per device. Keep that in mind. The bar is amazing, you feel as if you stepped back in time. Ornate walls, and mirrors with cathedral style ceilings and marble floors. It's a lovely experience. You can see central park from certain parts of the hotel. I would stay there without complaints again. Stayed in junior suite with two teens, nice size rooms with great bathrooms. Location is ideal if you like walking around - couple of blocks from Central Park, so we spent a lot of time there. We also walked down to Times Square and Rockefeller Plaza, but its too far with young kids. Restaurants are pricey, even by NYC standards, but there are lots of options around the immediate area - great Thai place around the corner. Front desk was quick and welcoming at check in, room was very clean and well maintained - beds were very comfortable.\\nPool is at the top of the hotel, with gorgeous views of Central Park. From all the rave reviews I've read over the past year on Parker Meriden I finally was able to get a room this past trip and was sorely disappointed with the overall quality of the rooms, the sheets, the small beds and the overall wear and tear of the place. The fitness room was being remodeled with lots of banging and hammering with no locker rooms or bathrooms to use while we were there and they still charged me the typical $10. The pool was MUCH smaller than they advertise and I was so disgusted that I shortened my 3 night stay to one and walked down to the Sheraton Towers on 7th where I got a bigger, newer room with Great Bedding, lots of free internet, a much nicer concierge and a brand new fitness center for morning workouts, for just $199/nt.--- $100 less than the Parker. Wouldn't EVER go back to Parker Meriden again. Over rated and swarmed with Asia tour bus types. Definitely nothing special. Not a 4 star boutique hotel that they advertise. That was ongoing during my visit with them it would have been nearly perfect. \\nI have to state that normally this is one of my normal haunts in the city. Rooms are incredibly spacious, bed is comfortable, staff is efficient, and it is in an area that I enjoy. My last trip in though - last week of September, I almost left the hotel within my first hour there and vowed to never return. Not because of the staff, nor because of the overall surroundings, but from the moment I walked in the sound of ongoing construction vibrated so loudly that by the time I was done checking in, my head was hurting so badly that I was nearly in tears. \\nIt was absolutely horrendous and unacceptable. The staff informed me that I would not hear it or be bothered by it in my suite so I proceeded to check in, also due to the fact that my room was already paid in advance for several days. \\nWhen I got into the room, again, very spacious, I found a note on the bed informing me that during the day, not to be alarmed if I was to see construction workers or firemen outside of my window, and not to worry, they were used to seeing people disrobed. Now I was pissed. I didn't care if THEY were used to it, I was NOT and again found it unacceptable that I had not been informed of this prior. It basically meant that during my stay I had to keep my curtains drawn the entire time, which I was not pleased about. \\nThe experience was truly unacceptable, and I may have over looked it if management had been somewhat gracious in regards to the situation, sending a bottle of wine to the room or maybe allowing for a later checkout, something to acknowledge that while the situation in regards to the construction was not their doing, they still were concerned overall for their guest comfort...ahem, and their hard earned money. But this was not the case, it was basically a \" well your screwed, were sorry about it, but it's your problem, not ours.\" \\nAnd that is a shame, as my children and I absolutely have loved staying here in the past. as well as the one in LA, where my children and I love taking a brisk swim over looking the city while basking n the sunlight and the all white rooms.... but due to their negligence in providing a comfort level that is to be expected at a Le Parker Meridien, we very well may find a new hotel to call our favorite. This was my first time in New York and it was WONDERFUL to stay so close to so many places. The hotel is walking distance (less than 20 minutes) from great places like Central Park (only 2 streets up), Times Sq, The Met, The MoMa, 5th Av,Broadway theatre district, and so much more! This is a good hotel, modern and young, I was on business travel so didn't have to worry too much about price, but it is not good for low budgets bc you have to pay for in-room internet and it's definitely not a low budget place, but if you have the money it is definitely worthy. I like to stay at The Parker. The service is great, its a good value, and the location in Midtown is ideal. The restaurant, Norma's is known for serving one of the best breakfasts in the city and the reputation is deserved. Bring your appetite because the portions are huge. I also like the coffee bar off the lobby. The only real negative is the rooms. The decor is very dated and they need to be updated. They are clean and all, and the beds are pretty comfortable, but a remodel is due. Location is excellent. Everything is within walking distance. We had a park view room which was nicely located on the 31st floor. The room was clean and bright. The size though at an average. The bar was a spot in the hotel we loved fery much. You can watch people strolling through the hotel and have excellent drinks. We'll definitively return to this hotel though might book a tower suite instead of the park view room for about a hundred bucks more. It's worth the money if you stay for one or two nights only and like the views (park and city). This hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to many sites in Midtown and close to subways for trips to neighbourhoods farther away. There are lots of great restaurants nearby as well as the theatre district. There is a Starbucks across the street on 56th and also a Dean and DeLuca a few doors down. The lobby is beautiful, great trendy (quirky!) burger joint behind a curtain off the lobby, and the lounge is a romantic and exotic place to have a drink at night.\\nThe rooms are nicely appointed and decorated with nice modern bathrooms. Staff were always very helpful. \\nOverall, great place to stay. Highly recommended. This is by far the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in in NYC. The staff from the desk clerks to the bell men and the door men were very friendly and nice. Our room was upgraded to a beautiful view of the park and it was spacious, comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. The location was very convenient in a great neighborhood! I would definitely stay here again and again! I have stayed at this hotel several times. On my most recent visit, the construction next door was deafening and so I specifically asked about it when I checked in. The fairly unfriendly person at the desk said that it no longer was a problem. Still, I was stunned when I went to my room, only to discover that it sat directly on top of the construction site. I went back to check in and an only slightly more friendly staff member changed me to the other side of the building. And neither room was Starwood Preferred (I'm Gold status), even though the hotel seemed far from fully occupied. Even though the hotel's location is very good, I'd rather stay somewhere where the staff seems to value my repeat business. We stayed in Le Parker Meridien when attending a military ball on Saturday night. We were well within walking distance to some great restaurants, the hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and the room comfortable and clean. TV was old - hummed and had fuzzy reception. But who cares, we had better stuff to do. Surprised my wife with an overnight stay at the Patker Méridien New York on West 56th Street this past weekend. Great hotel... Perfect location... Friendly & welcoming staff. When the hotel learned that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary they gave us a lovely room on the 36th floor overlooking Central Park. Great views. The bathroom floor was a little dirty but we mentioned this to the chamber maid and she immediately apologized and took care of it right away. (She did say she wasn't on duty when the room was made up but she apologized for the other staff if we felt our room wasn't as spiffy as we expected.) Bustling restaurant. Lounge is one of the most beautiful rooms in the City! I have stayed at the Parker Meridian annually for the past 5 years. It is my NYC hotel of choice. It is chic, spotless and comfortable. The staff is friendly and efficient.The rooms are quiet, beautifully sleek and comfortable. Location is excellent.I would not stay anywhere else! The Le Parker Meridien is a great hotel. The interior design is cool the way Palm Springs is cool....it's from a past but recent era, but it was cool then, and it's cool now. And, it is in very well-preserved condition. The room was spotless. The view of Central Park from the 32nd floor was tremendous. Even the toiletries in the room were top-notch. I will stay here on every trip to New York City from now on. Stayed one night for business. Starwood upgrade gave us a generous sized room, small bathroom. Clean. Heating worked well. Loved the umbrella in the closet - it poured rain the whole time I was there. Staff was approachable and helpful. Great wifi reception on 17th floor. Lobby was not a usual Le Meridian style, and was not inviting. Design of lobby into bar or into restauarant did not transition well. Stay was a good value for a great location, easy walking distance to Park, stores, Broadway. Would stay here again. The Parker Meridian is a well located, good sized hotel with an outstanding staff and the best hotel gym I have experienced. The reception staff is consistently warm, upbeat and helpful. The hotel has a slightly hip buzz, which it cultivates in everyting from its \"Do Not Disturb\" signs (\"Fuhgeddaboutit\") to placards apologizing for a piece of out-of-order gym equipment (\"Kaput\"). Some of the rooms are spacious by NY standards, others are just average sized, but none require the skills of a contortionist to navigate them the way other NY hotel rooms can. The room decor and finishes are getting a bit tired, and could use freshening up, but the rooms are comfortable and offer a good desk layout. The Gravity gym in the basement of the hotel is well equipped and spacious by hotel gym standards, and is my major reason for returning repeatedly. The burger joint serves some of the best, and certainly the best priced, burgers in the city. this is a great hotel. the staff is helpful, courteous and professional. the rooms are really nice, clean and well-sized for nyc. the room service and restaurants are expensive but the food and service are both very good. it's a pleasure staying at this hotel from check-in to check-out. You can't beat the location of this hotel...bang in the middle of some of NYC's famous attractions (Central Park, Rockfeller Ctr, 5th ave shopping, Met, etc)...and they charge a premium for it. The room itself was small (comfortable by NY's standard) but, you could tell that it was old and needed upgrades. It seems that the hotel's being rennovated (construction and the noise that accompanies it all day long). I'd say avoid the hotel 'til the rennovations are complete. The remodel of the penthouse meeting room is something to behold; truly breathtaking backdrop to any presentation or event. The beds are comfortable, and the rooms are clean. I love the burger place in the lobby, but room service is a little pricy. The hotel is a bit over rated, and given the price not sure its worth it. The rooms are a tad faded, and could definitly do with a make-over, and the concierge / reception was unpersonal and lacked friendliness. Also, another lift would be good,had to wait atleast 15 minutes for elevator each morning.\\nHowever, on the plus side, the location is great slap bang in manhattan, and you cant really beat the roof top pool, which is great for a morning swim. I have stayed here several times now and will pick it as often as I can get a good rate, relative to other nice spots nearby. I am always impressed at check-in with their \"Welcome Back Mr. ___\". This time I messed up and did not put two people on my reservation and did not even know it included breakfast. Our check-in host made sure we got the proper certificates to both get the free breakfasts. That is no small deal as breakfast at Norma's can easily run $30-40 a person, but is worth it. No kidding, this may be one of the top breakfast spots in the world. I have never seen so many diners taking pictures of their breakfast plates. But they are pretty awesome. Back to the hotel - the Jr. Suites are a great choice in Manhattan for this location if you can get them at a good price. Good space, nicely appointed, a bit contemporary but very comfortable with room to move around. Everything is nearby as you can take a hearty but doable walk to Broadway theaters, Art museum, Nat. Hist. museum, and of course Central Park, Columbus circle, shopping and plenty of really good restaurants are so close. Also, the lounge is a comfortable, fun spot to watch folks go by, Norma's is a \"must do\", and the hamburger joint is quirky spot, with OK food but fun and unique to have right in the lobby. I've been staying here off and on since the mid-90s. Recently returned for a longish stay for first time in three years. Pleasantly surprised to find things in good nick. If you luck into a high floor it can be pretty quiet and restful for midtown. Only issue is tech: the wi-fi is extra and per device. The TV's are turn-of-the-century, which would not be so bad if they had better connections. On my latest stay, there were annoying sound problems with the NBC signal and a snowy picture for the ABC affiliate. the hotel bar is excellent: great atmosphere, decor, etc. And the drinks are damn good too. Good locale & friendly staff. My only big issue? They seemed to blatantly ignore the well-established \"eco-ing\" of hotels. No recycle bins in rooms (Kimpton does), nothing re reduced water use, heat, energy etc. This is not 1983. Traveled to NYC for the first time to meet friends and sightsee. Le Parker Meridien was a great choice for us. The location was wonderful. We were close to Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, shops, restaurants, etc. The rooms were of modern design. Clean and comfortable. Hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. The Parker Meridien is a wonderful hotel. I have stayed with them twice for business trips to NY and have had the same, great experience with each visit. Traveling alone to New York from the Midwest, I feel very comfortable, safe and at home at the Parker. The location cannot be beat, the rooms are modern and clean, the gym is amazing and the staff are all very helpful and friendly. Loved the view of Central Park and really enjoyed the 5 day stay... Once again! Thank you! Clean, upscale, sophisicated and modern describe the environment and atmosphere. The Burger Joint (tucked away on the main floor) is a best kept secret and the toiletries provided are of the quality I like to have when I travel (and have forgotten something) i.e, glycerin soap, good quality lotion, etc. Location convenient to shopping and offices. Disappointed by the \"old style\" TV in my room. Flat Screen TVs are what I expected from this brand. What you expect from Meridien - large entryway, marble, retro signage etc; and the service was great. They have a fairly large gym, and a great \"Burger Joint\" in lobby - albeit tiny place with limited seating. The bar scene has nice low lighting driving some good ambience (so less cold hotel feel and tad more hip than some places). Nearby are some good quick stop shop kind of places to bulk up on water, etc for the room. Prices for food are ridiculous at Le Parker (Breakfast for one after charges and tip to room etc was $40+ and we are talking about eggs and bacon here). No good diner nearby either to run too...just Starbucks on every corner. No coffee maker in room. Mini bar but didn't look at prices after I saw the room service. Fairly quiet hotel. Rooms are quite large and well appointed, but again, old CRT Tvs with very poor picture quality which is unacceptable for this day and age especially with the low cost of TVs currently. I was very pleased with this hotel overall. I found the staff to be very nice, professional and efficient. I found room service, laundry service, and housekeeping to be worth the cost of the room. I will concede that the decor in the room a dated, but I still like this place overall and would gladly stay there again Le Parker Meridien is a very well located hotel and the rooms are clean and comfy. But the staff is not as friendly as the website says, the breakfast is very expensive (thanks for the Starbucks and Dean and Delluca nearby) and the internet is paid (VERY WELL PAID). It's nice to have the Joint Burger so close, but I don't want to be charged for the wifi in a hotel anymore. It's insane. We chose this hotel to spend a week in New York doing the tourist trails over the new year period. After seven nights in a Junior Suite we left Le Parker Meridian feeling disappointed with their customer service offering and our overall experience. So you know a bit about our choice you should know we looked for hotel location and for quality / comfort. \\nWhat Le Parker Meridian Delivered Well:\\nThe Junior Suite was a good size for big city standards. Don't get too excited it's not cheap, even by NY standards. There were some poorly performed maintenance jobs (carpet not fitted around TV cables etc) which should not be expected in any room type. \\nRoom Service was again not cheap but they delivered a reasonable quality within 20-30 mins. The price was not better than going to a 4-5 star restaurant. \\nRoom Cleaning was excellent, the house keeping team were flexible and friendly. They worked hard and always left the room in an excellent condition.\\nWhere some work needs to be done in our opinion:\\nHaving stayed in a raft of different types of hotels from the humble Premier Inn's to some of the best all inclusive resorts in the Caribbean and many in between both for business and pleasure we have some experience of varying quality in customer services and attitude. Often the rule applies that you get what you pay for. Not so here.\\nWe had too many bad attitudes and lackluster responses to simple requests for this to be a snap shot or bad day. Clearly the reception and main customer facing staff need to receive some training in who the customer is and what they represent to them, their wages and the brand they are representing. \\nTo be fair in this review we had two excellent staff members, the head of concierge and our house keeper. They could teach their colleuges some inexpensive but very valuable lessons. Sadly in any customer focused environment the poorest performing people lower the standards and customer experience - a fact that no hotel manager can escape.\\nThere seems to be a recurring problem at this hotel that we sadly also experienced: They use a detergent which will irritate anyone with even slightly sensitive skin. We are not too precious about this but due to the red, itching patches appearing on our legs and arms we were convinced we had bed bugs. After another night of itching they despatched a pest controller who checked the room, bed etc thoroughly and found no trace of bed bugs - Great news! The worrying comments made from the head of house keeping prompted this detail to our report. She told us that they have many bed bug issues AND many complaints from guests who are irritated by the detergent they use on their linen. This prompts the question: WHY? We self medicated by buying an expensive 'calming creme' but for the price per night this is very poor. In New York city and in a higher end hotel, I believe that this is simple to rectify by using a better quality linen / detergent. \\nWe also experienced another negative at this hotel. Our credit card was cloned and a matter of hours following check out $500 was charged to our card by another hotel in New Jersey (our credit card company confirmed this was done over the phone not in person). Le Parker Meridian was the only place to take our card details (and store them) and know our travel arrangement. Although there may be some response to this review from the management, this hotel has a big problem, one which honest travellers should be aware of. By the time we saw the fake charge we were back in the UK and we are letting the card company deal with the fraud their end. I decided not to call the hotel (at my further expense) from the UK to report this to them as I would not know who to trust. Again as already commented this is (hopefully) one dishonest member of staff but our experience was poor.\\nWifi is charged at $16 per day AND per device NOT room. We felt in these days of multiple wifi reliant devices this is unfair to guests paying a premium. The wifi is free in the lobby for unto 30 mins but its free for as long as you want in most coffee shops so they are being very stingy in our opinion and compared to other worldwide hotels.\\nLe Parker Meridian's website is a far cry from what they deliver. We really wanted the experience they offered but sadly it was disappointing and not a hotel we would consider revisiting again.\\nFeel free to ask any questions via in mail if you need further detail. If you choose to stay at the Parker, you are choosing wisely. Positioned perfectly in Midtown, I love the access to the Park and the views when I am lucky enough to stay on that side. Being a Starwood Platinum member, the Parker offers something I don't get a lot of which is a very unique experience. The service is also top-notch without being stuffy and makes you realize how bad it is at other places.\\nThe food options in-room, at the Burger Joint, coffee and drinks at Knave and Norma's create a combination that is unmatched in my travels to other NY hotels, you could stay for days and just eat!\\nOn my third visit, I realized I did not have HD TV in the room, but opting for a jog in the Park is a better option anyway. I will return whenever I can to the Parker, it is my hotel of choice in NYC. I have stayed at the Le Parker Meridien in NYC many times. The hotel is in a wonderful location just off Sixth Avenue on 56th Street - vey convenient to almost everthing New York has to offer. The rooms are on the small side, but fully updated.\\nThe hotel is my choice on all my trips to New York.\\nOn the side, the Health Club is going through a complete renovation which will be completed shortly. This is a modern hotel with a very European feel. We stayed using Starpoints in a room that was billed as 2 twin beds...thought this a little strange and was wary, but the beds were quite large and comfortable for one person and the room was spacious and worked well. Staff were very helpful. We stayed during the time of nearby construction -didn't appreciate this when we booked, and didn't appreciate the noice that woke us up at 7am - but when I mentioned it at checkout, incidentals were taken off the bill, which was a nice surprise, and I received an email saying the noisey construction apparently is now over. The hotel is an easy walk from 5th avenue, lots of good restaurants close. We didn't sample the famous burgers -didn't really know about them until checkout when we say a big line for them, but if you want to sample, apparently you can order ahead. It was busy when we were there, and the elevators were crowded but would definitely go back. Considering the huge number of hotels in NYC, we won't be staying here again. Pros: Front Desk (Lawrence) and view of Central Park. Cons: Cramped dark room, aweful television, hair in bathroom sink (prior quest), constant noise from elevators running, no coffee maker in room (not even bottled water for Starwood Gold Preferred members). Starwood should be ashamed of keeping this property in its portfolio. I suppose the best compliment one can give to any business is to do business with them again even when there are other choices available. I wil certainly and gladly stay at this hotel again. The staff, the facility and the comfortable feel of the hotel are terrific. From the front door to the bell station, check-in, concession shop, bar staff, etc, this staff have your comfort and best experience possible forefront in their minds. It is evident by the manner in which they work with you at every turn. The convenience and location are perfect for any mid-town shopping and restaurant activities. \\nThe room was wonderful. Modern without being too cliche. Comfortable bed, beautiful view, low noise between rooms and great room staff. \\nTry this hotel. You will be very glad you did. The hotel is very nice. Rooms have a modern feel. The staff is very nice and very accommodating. We stayed on the fifth floor, which is low, facing the street. The street noise did bleed into the room, especially when taxis laid in on their horns. In the end, it didn't matter much to us but if you're a light sleeper, it might be a factor for you. \\nMy wife and I stayed here with our two kids. We asked for a room with two beds. The beds that were in the room could generously be described as \"super-twin\" beds. It would be a stretch to call them double beds or full beds. Even our kids, who are both under 10, said the next morning that the beds were really small. Once I got settled in, the bed was comfortable enough. And since I don't move much when I sleep, it didn't bother me as much. Since the beds were so small, I called the front desk to ask for a cot. They said that because of a fire code, they were not allowed to let us have a cot in the room. I wasn't sure if that was true or not. After pressing, they said even if they could get a cot into the room, it would be $40. That seemed a little steep so we passed on it.\\nOne good thing about the room is that there are outlets everywhere. So if you have a lot of phones, computers, iPads, etc. to charge, you will have no problem finding an outlet to plug in. Also, there is a small desk with a Herman Millar office chair. So if you have to do some work while you are staying in the room, the working area, while on the small side, is comfortable.\\nI noticed that I could hear the people in the next room when they used any water, whether it was flushing the toilet, taking a shower or using the sink. To minimize the noise going into the room, I closed the door of our bathroom. That was effective in dampening the noise though I was not expecting to have to do that. \\nThe pool on the top floor is a nice treat. Even if you don't go up to swim, you should go up to see the view of Central Park to the north. To get up there, you have to go up to the 22nd floor and then change elevators to go the rest of the way. When we stayed there, there must have been some glitch in the system because the second set of elevators took a long time. It took 15-20 minutes for an elevator to even get to the 22nd floor. When it finally arrived, it was literally packed full. We were able to squeeze in the front but it was uncomfortably full for everyone. Then, the elevator proceeded to stop at almost every floor. On some floors, a group of people were waiting for an elevator. You could see their faces drop when they saw how full the elevator was. On other floors, there was no one waiting at all. After waiting about 15-20 mins to get the elevator, it literally took another 15-20 mins to get up to the top floor. And I think we may have skipped only two floors out of 22 on the way up. The people who were in the elevator at first were even more frustrated than we were. My kids forgot their goggles back on the fifth floor. But rather than take the elevator, I walked down 22 flights of stairs and took the lower elevator down to the fifth floor. Then, on the way up, I took the elevator from the fifth to the 22nd floor. Then, rather than wait for the elevator, I walked back UP 22 flights of stairs. It's just my opinion, but I think I got there more quickly by walking then I would have by waiting. It's kind of a minor issue but it's the kind of issue that sticks out in your memory. From this day forward, when our kids talk about that hotel, they'll be saying to each other, \"That's the hotel where the elevator took forever, remember?\" So even though the rest of the hotel was very nice, this is unfortunately what we will be remembering about the hotel.\\nAssuming the elevator issue is not an issue, I would recommend anyone to stay here. We got a good deal and given the location of the hotel, in all reality, it was a good choice for us. I have stayed at the Le Parker Meridien twice and both were very nice times. The rooms are nothing too exciting. That's my only negative thing. Just expect the rooms to have more of a flair and they are dull in decor. The breakfast is to die for. Make sure to get their orange juice. I swear they gave orange trees in their kitchen. Oh yummmmy!!!its located next to Carnegie Hall and many celebrities stay here. You might catch one. I got to Jason Mraz. Woohoo. I hear the burger place in the hotel is amazing. I've never eaten because I'm not a huge burger fan. But if you are, this is supposed to be a great stop. Love, love, love this place. Rooms have a simple, understated, modern elegance. I was upgraded with a million dollar Central Park view inside a large (by NYC standards) room. Great toiletries from Peter Thomas Roth. Everyone from doorman to housekeeping, concierge to front desk, pool person to bartender is very friendly and always says a casual \"good morning\" when they see you. It's in a stupendous location, very central if you need to see people uptown or downtown, but far enough away from Times Sq to, well, be far enough away from Times Sq. Many subway lines to almost anywhere just steps away. But my favorite part is the close proximity (3 short blocks) for runs in Central Park. Excellent value for what you get. I invited a friend who works for Frommers, and who just wrote a guidebook for them, up to my room and he was very impressed! Very efficient and well located hotel. Rooms are comfortable and quiet. Nice pool. Norma's Restaurant has the best breakfast anywhere. Good hotel for casual or business visitor Great get away hotel for our family from Connecticut. Enclosed rooftop pool a top priority for kids, The Burger Joint comes in a close second. Staff has always been accomodating when asked for a favor. Perfect location, within walking distance to everything. We always have a wonderful time at Le Parker Meridan. We've stayed here many times even through the noisy renovations which are now complete and have always been delighted. The staff is always polite and helpful. The Hotel location is very well suited for our family needs. It's located right in the middle of mid-town with exits onto 56th and 57th streets. The rooms are very nice, modern and up to date, and very well maintained. Many rooms on 57th street have a view of the park. If you enjoy breakfast, don't miss Norma's. If you enjoy burgers, don't miss the Burger Joint. If you want to relax, go to the Knave. Enjoy coffee, tea and drinks. We were a family of 4 who stayed here during the Xmas holidays. This hotel has a great location being close to central park, 5th avenue,couple of subway stations to Times Square etc. That is the best thing about this hotel. Also,the pool on the 42nd floor is amazing.\\nHowever,the bad things are that they don't have any double beds for example for a family of 4 or more.What they offer with an upgrade of room is a king bed( which I honestly think was the size of queen bed) along with a sofa bed. Both the bed and the sofa bed are old,flemsy and so uncomfortable. They are millions of years away from the beds we are used sleeping on at hotels such as Hyatt or Hilton etc or any of the resorts in CA.\\nI would rate the beds as the worst about this hotel.\\nThe other bad thing is the restaurant downstairs.The staff are unfriendly. We had breakfast there only once and never went back. Once we were finally sitting down at out table and the server took out orders of simple pancakes and cereal, we had to wait almost an hour for our food to arrive.The server didn't even say a simple sorry for the delay. It is a very pricy restaurant.Pancakes go for $22. Perhaps if the service was good or the food arrived fast, it would still be possible to justify it being it's Manhattan but I'm afraid not.Other day we ate at other restaurants close by with much better service and much better prices.We particularly like cafe Europa just outside the hotel. Perfect location for all things NYC, whether business or pleasure - this is a great spot! A top-tier hotel at a very reasonable room rate. One is not overpaying for the cachet of the Le Meridien name. We only interacted with the reception desk staff and they were more than friendly and helpful. The requests that we made when reserving online were honored and we were informed of this at the time we checked in. The room was spacious. Excellent desk space and task chair if you are there on business. The TV could be rotated for viewing from many angles. Spacious bathroom. More closet storage space than many NYC hotels. I guess it's my Midwest sensibility, but I'm always underwhelmed by accommodations in NYC, and this is no exception. The strength is its location--a relative oasis in Midtown, near the park, subway, theater... everywhere. And the staff is efficient and... just great. I know the construction is just temporary and not their fault, but when I was there in November, there was drilling on a Sunday at 7 am. I regularly slept through fire alarms and I couldn't sleep through this. And \"temporary\" I don't think means like a few days. I think it means months to a year of foundation work. I ate breakfast elsewhere, but the dining area is obviously insufficient, the spa closed while I was there, the lobby hardly obvious, sheathed in scaffolding. I would stay there again in the future (like a year from now), but I would call first and see about the general state of things. As for the reviewer who mentioned closing certain areas of the hotel... My understanding is that the most tedious of work is next door, not in the hotel, and at least from when I was there the noise is so loud that no part of the hotel is safe. I was on the 29th floor and still hurting. The room? Large for NY but kind of sterile. I did get a peek of a higher floor room, and that was better. Other than the front desk staff, the other high point was the bar on a weeknight. Perfect location, great staff, Rooms are very nice. loved it. The one night stay for a work trip to NY was ruined due to the buolding works going on. In hindsight, they should have closed down those sections of the hotel affected by what felt like someone was directly above and under you. I understand the work has now been completed, but it meant I did not sleep well, and for the price we paid, I think it was not value for money at all. That aside, service and the actual room were ok, but not spectacular.I do have to stay here again in the next couple of months because we have a corporate account with them... so we shall see. The location, the service, the rooms- excellent -just what I expect from Le Meridien... Great hotel. Mini suites could have used two tv's one for the sitting area/roll out and one for the bedroom. I am a platinum spger and have stayed here several times due to the location. Never again! We arrived on dec 26 after checkin time (4pm) yet our room was not ready despite having called to confirm after we landed as we were on a tight time frame. No upgrade - busy time of year. After being late to our event we were looking forward to sleeping in before brunch. Ah no way. The jack hammers started at 7! the entire building shook. I awoke in a panic- earthquake (we used to be californians). No warning despite the fact i booked shortly in advance and by phone. No warning when we checked in. After 2 mornings of this we decided to find somewhere else to stay and enjoy our final night of vacation. When i called down to the front desk they said not only would they not refund our final night but would charge us extra if we left early. Simply unbelievable. Naturally we put the do not disturb sign out and left for some blissful rest elsewhere at great expense. Terrible experience made worse by the hotel's poor handling of a bad situation. Good size rooms (for New York) and everything you would expect. Really busy with lots of business folk most of the time, I'm told. No coffee maker or tea facilities in room,until I complained and it was sorted but this is ridiculous in a hotel of this stature. Room service expensive. The breakfast diner is wildly expensive and food moderate. $86 for the 2 of us for a so so breakfast. For $86 I would expect the works!\\nAll in all they are used to expense accounts and not worrying about the tab...\\nThe secret Burger joint was always busy...long lines when we were there (just after Christmas) so has a reputation, but didn't dine there...\\nLocation was excellent , next to Carnegie Hall, and a short walk to Lincoln Center where we had tickets for a concert;also Broadway shows an easy walk away...saw Alan Rickman in \"Seminar\" ... so the location could not be better.... We loved this hotel. There are some reviews stating that the decor is a bit faded. Personally we hope that they do not \"modernise\" it any time soon. It has real quality and character.\\nOviously the bit problem at the moment is the noise. In our case the hotel was top notch in getting us a suite on the quiet side of the hotel - five star. However I am afraid to say that if you cannot get a room on the quiet (South Side) of the hotel I could not recommend that you stay here - my wife had a head ache in the first hour and you litterly cannot hear yourself speak.\\nThe hotel is doind its very best with the situation but if you have a noisy room you just cannot enjoy your stay. My family has had the pleasure of staying at Le Parker Meridien in NYC on 2 occasions and both visits have been exceptional! Super location on 56th Street near metro station. Very spacious, clean, modern rooms. Super nice staff. Really, we've stayed in lots of hotels (usually 4+ stars) during our family vacations in places across the US and this hotel ranks right at the top. There is also a top-rated burger joint on site--we did not eat there, but noticed lots of people in line waiting to get in. Thanks, Le Parker Meridien, for another great stay! Stayed here New Year's 2011/12. Excellent location as I was using the hotel as a launching pad to explore the city. Stayed on the 40th floor, they do an excellent job catering to platinum members, but I assume that same service is available to everyone. The rooms were large and very well appointed. My only complaint would be that the bedroom was smaller than I would have thought, even with double bed. The suite was really set up to only sleep in the bedroom and spend the rest of your time elsewhere. Some things were a bit pricey (haircut was reasonable, the restaurant not as much). The burger joint inside the hotel is fantastic, a real touch of character. Also, the windows opened, which is quite impressive.\\nHowever, what really set this apart was the service. New Year's can be crazy in New York, but I always felt served promptly and quickly. Apart from the concierge desk being understaffed, I was able to have all sorts of random requests serviced very quickly by the front desk. Very professional, which was appreciated! Thanks again! The only bad thing I can talk about is that Internet is paid for. Stayed for a Pitbull concert at roseland ballroom. Very convenient location. As a gold member got upgraded to a suite even though they were sold out! Great place would definitely stay again. The night shift front desk was great! Alex was extremely friendly and helpful! haven't stayed there before, had once a breakfast at \"norma's\" ,and been there couple of times fr the usual \"joint burger\" \\nrooms are small, shower was really small and with bad maintenance no sleepers , no ice cubes, etc... ,we were staying at the 16th floor and the construction noise was just terrible, we had to change to floor 20 to have a calm sleep, anyway won't be my first priority, and fr the record next time ill be looking for something outside of manhattan. We hadn't stayed LPM since about 8 yrs ago. Place was just as great. Staff very friendly and accomodating. Room super clean and still feel modern- the junior suite was perfect for a family of four. Location cant be beat - 2 blocks from Central Park and near subway stations. A great bargain at $300/night. The only drawback is if you get a warm day in winter, you cant adjust the thermostat and have cold air blow in. When the heat is on, that's it. Did not hear the jackhammers others talk about. Watch out for Norma's though. The service was not very good, the food was inedible, and everything was grossly overpriced. A third-rate diner would have been better than that place. Checked in 12/26. Jack hammering in the street, drilling DIRECTLY outside our window, and hammering and drilling in unit directly above! Unbelievable. No one when the reservation was made said anything about construction, nor did the front desk say anything at check-in. In addition, told no availability to upgrade (entitled as an SPG gold member if they have room), despite hearing the people next to us at check in being upgraded, without asking, to the class we were entitled to. It became appearant that no upgrade was forthcoming as we were redeeming points for the room. This is counterintuitive to me, you would think they would want to treat loyal customers well. With all the other fabulous hotel choices in the city...we won't stay here again. The staff is incredible. From the moment I pulled in front of the hotel the bell staff was taking the luggage and arranging to park the car. The front desk was excellent and accommodated a new request with a smile & efficiency. Everyone always greets you with a hello & a smile, holding elevator doors or eager to answer questions or help in every way. The rooms are fantastic, comfortable & efficient. Very clean. The pool is always great, my daughter can swim in there for hours. So convenient to all mid town manhattan areas and being adjacent to Central Park is a huge plus. I've stayed here a number of times and will do it again.\\nHighly recommended!!!!!\\nWe were told that there would be construction when we made the reservation and we were actually given a choice to stay on the 56th side vs the construction site on 57th when we checked in. But, we wanted the park view and opted for the construction side. I would probably change that next time and take the 56th street side. But, it's NYC and there's lots of noise. It's not the hotel's fault that there's construction going on next door. My husband and I had a very nice stay accept for the construction work noise and delay in being able to attain our room in a reasonable time period. Location couldn't have been better and the staff is excellent. Rooms were adequate and service was very good. We arrived on 12/23 for 5 nights (using SPG points, 2 rooms, 36th floor, park view). When I called to book I was very specific to ask if there would be construction as we had been there in the summer and there was scaffolding and construction happening during that time. Also asked the concierge when calling 3 weeks earlier to make dinner reservations. She said no construction would be going on.\\nAwoke to jackhammers at 7:00AM on 26th, 27th and 28th. I'm telling you it's really loud!\\nAdditionally, when we were there in the summer one of the rooms had a faulty air-conditioner and the room wouldn't get cool. This time we had a room with so much heat blasting out that maintenence had to turn of the air system completely which left the room stuffy and still hot even with the window ajar.\\nUpon check out I requested to speak to a manager -- none available. The front desk person explained that the people I spoke to must not have realized we were staying past the 25th.\\nREALLY???!!!!!\\nNever staying here again! Recently stayed four nights and while there are certainly downsides, compared to other nearby hotels including the Essex House and Plaza it really good value. Yes, the noise is pretty unbearable but then again this is NYC and those at the Essex House and those who actually live nearby have to live with it. If you can get an upper floor larger room with a view of the park, it's pretty hard to beat unless you're willing to pay $1,000+ at the Essex House or Plaza. I've read many of the reviews and agree the outdated elevators that stop on every floor during peak mornings, annoying charge for wifi and not the most redecorated rooms, but the staff are as good as they get in NYC. People like Majda made our stay really great. Thank you. Having read the reviews about the next-door construction I had called about two weeks in advance of my stay to confirm a city-view and high floor (I was travelling with a 19 month old). I also requested an upgrade and was told that a note was made in my reservation but that I'd have to wait until check-in to see if anything was available (as typical in most hotel reservations). Was pleasantly pleased upon arrival that I was able to upgrade to a junior suite - perfect for my wife and child. Didn't hear a single construction noise (although we were usually up and about before 9:00am, which is when most of the construction started - hotel lobby level was VERY noisy with construction/jack-hammering - absolute torture for the staff who have to work through it every day). \\nAs others have pointed out, hvac didn't seem to work that well - couldn't get the room as cool as I'd like (I'm a 68-69 degree person) but wasn't that much of an issue as outside temps were in the mid 30s. \\nOverall very happy with this stay and will likely stay again - happens to be a perfect spot for what my wife and I like to do the most - shop! Sauna was closed for renovation (December 2011); Air-conditioning does not work in winter. I was asked to open the window which was impossible (too heavy) and unpleasant (construction noise outside). Stay did not meet the expectations I had for a hotel in this category I checked in this hotel 12/28/11 and will be here until 1/2/12. Overall, an average hotel with regular room rather small. The location is great. As a platinum member, I didn't get much except 500 points from them. I got a small room and our view is another high rise. The gym was closed until Dec 30. I tried to print a single page document and they required minimum credit card payment of $6. I would try other SPG hotels in the area next time I'm in NYC Arriving from the west coast, we checked in to the hotel after midnight, grabbed a late snack and turned in, only to wake up at 7am EST (4am PST) to the sound of jackhammers. I am a heavy sleeper and it still woke me up. In the lobby, you could feel the vibration, but there wasn't anything the hotel could do about the construction. \\nWe asked for another room that was further from the construction, and luckily there was a room available on a higher floor and away from the noise. The front desk was super helpful, the new room was an upgrade over the previous room, and the jackhammer noise was mostly muffled, at least enough to let us sleep to a more reasonable hour. Just now got home from our annual post-Mas stay, and although, to be fair, some critics here have some legit issues, all in all, we look forward to returning next year! \\nThe hvac system does seem somewhat unresponsive, but the good news is that the windows are operable, so the temperature is relatively easily mitigated by the outside air. The mini-bar fridge wasn't working in our jr. suite, so a seperate mini-fridge arrived to cool the libations brought from home (which worked better than stuffing them inbetween the mini-bar items anyway!) We had 2 rooms, one of which was affected by the [non-hotel] construction noise, and a small price adjustment was offered, and gratefully accepted.\\nOur upgrade to the tower park view twin for our sons and tower junior suite for us made this yet another great stay at LPM, and the Hotel's wonderful situation close to 5th Avenue & Central Park, along with many great restaurants and conveniences, easily makes up for any relatively insigificant inconveniences afore mentioned. Staff is ever friendly and I still think the rooms are a refreshing change from similarly-priced traditional fare in the City.\\nGotta say that LPM once again earns our vote as best family-priced *wood property in NYC. \\n__________________ I must agree about the noise, not only in the lobby but through out the hotel. My daughter and I were given a room on the 7th floor, directley above the building work's After being woken at 6-30. All we needed to do was ask at the reception, and they mooved all our belongings up to 30th floor, by the time we got back from a busy day shopping.\\nThe staff are very helpfull. and the feather topper's and pillows are a very welcolme return to your room and bed at the end of the day. We've stayed with our family at Le Parker Meridien a few times now and each time has been great. We get adjoining rooms which works out well for our family of 5. The first time there we upgraded to a suite attached to a king room which was very spacious- almost more than we needed. The rooms are a great size and the bathrooms are nice as well. \\nMy kids love having the Burger Joint on site and we ate there each time. Great food- basic burgers and fries but can't beat the prices. The kids also loved the pool and it's nice that they have a lifeguard/pool attendent working at all times. \\nMy only complaint about the hotel is the conceirege staff. On each occasion we've asked for what I considered to be pretty basic suggestions- a family friendly breakfast spot, a good place to grab a sit down pizza/salad for lunch and a place to rent a DVD (they have DVD players in the room). Each of the three questions were answered so poorly---- for breakfast they sent us (in the pouring rain) to a total dive diner. The highchair they gave us was so disgusting I had to walk out the minute we got seated. We found a bagel place 3 blocks away that was much better. Also Sarabeths' on the park is excelllent (found it ourselves). For pizza, the only suggestion that conceirege had was again a total dive. We found Angelo's ourselves on 57th street (directly across from the back entrance of the hotel) which was perfect. Great pizza and salad. Crowded but perfect with kids. Finally, she had no advice on the DVD which was shocking considering there was a Duane Read on the corner with a Blockbuster self service machine (for $1!!!). For such a nice hotel, they really need a better informed conceirege staff. \\nThe hotel is walking distance to a lot- Central Park, Times Square, 5th Avenue. Great for sightseeing, shopping or just walking around. \\nOverall, we'll be back (and I'll be sure to do some internet research on restaurants before we go). Well first time in NY & the Hotel was great. Good Rooms Good Facility & Good Location.. Building going on next door is noisy during the day BUT we were always out & about.. We would stay again.. Overall a disappointing stay here. We had read about the noise from the construction and came prepared to deal with it. The jack hammer noise in the lobby was amazingly loud. The desk told us the noise would stop between 5-5:30 and it did. Should have been okay - but not so much. There were garbage trucks compacting and hauling away the construction debris that literally occurred one night from 8:00 (when we arrived back to room) until around midnight when we finally passed out. This noise happened each night of our stay. \\nPros: Great location. The suite we stayed in was very spacious. The overall hotel has a modern austere feel. \\n Other drawbacks for us was to have to pay for wifi for the computers. My husband was told by the hotel company that parking was included in the rate he had booked but upon checkout was told we had to pay for it. We were also told we would be on a higher floor away from construction which did not happen. In short, bring earplugs if you decide to stay and be wary of rate details. I went with my wife and three kids on December 23rd. Checkin was simple and I was able to get into the room a little early. The room was spacious (for NYC standards), updated and very clean. The front desk staff was very pleasant and when I inquired about getting a city map they provided one at no charge. Please do not let others understate the construction noise! The noise in the beautiful lobby is deafening. We did not visit any of the hotel restaurants this year - but I imagine they would not be very pleasant. My family loves a parting burger at The Joint - not this year. We just wanted to leave. The lovely girl at the desk was apologetic, said we would be \"above it\" on the 31st floor but did note that there is a warning on the web site. We come here every year for a family holiday stay and call directly for reservations - no mention of the noise. I checked the web site - the reservation page has is a link to \"Photos - Hotel Information - Special Conditions.\" It should be in HUGE letters on the home page. \\nHere is the warning - \"Additionally, the foundation work of a nearby building is subjecting some rooms and the hotel's lobby level to daytime noise which can begin as early as 7 am.\"\\nOur rooms were on the 31st floor - what a view - and what a cacophony! We asked for rooms on the south side of the hotel to escape, but there were no connecting rooms available. A promised, the noise stopped at 5:30PM and began again at 7:00AM. Seven AM is NOT when I want to arise on a holiday. The hotel-provided earplugs were insufficient. \\nAs stated, we return annually. The rooms are not very luxurious - small and a little stark and modern for my taste, but clean and serviceable. My husband loves this hotel and is specially fond of the cartoons in the elevator. The location is perfect for a midtown home base. Restaurants, sights, shopping, park, and theaters are all walking distance. \\nPLEASE ask if the construction is still going on and request a room on the south side of the hotel. This is not typical city noise of traffic, horns, and ambulances. This is BANGING. This hotel was perfect for my family, 2 adults, three children. King bed with queen sofa and located near all the fun spots. Walk to Central Park, 5th Ave shops, Rockefeller Center, FAO Schwartz, and a subway stop on the corner. Great restaurant, Martha's for breakfast and great burger joint for lunch. Fun glass enclosed pool on top for kids. Will stay again on next trip. Great 4 night stay at Le Parker Meridien. Spent time at Knave, the on site site bar and had a great time. We were upgraded to a 36th floor room with a great view of Central Park. Easy walk to Central Park, 5th Ave. It would be nice if they had coffee in the room. There is a Starbucks across the street on 56th. Great hotel in a fabulous location (a few minutes walk to Central Park and 5th Avenue) and with friendly and efficient staff. We stayed from 12 to 19 December 2011 and there was noise from the building work next door, but, hey, this is a crowded city and it was not the hotel's fault. Would be happy to stay there again and hope that we will. Room was very nice with a large screen rotating TV. Good size room, esp for NYC. The restaurant downstairs (Norma's) was AWESOME, but really expensive for brunch. If you want to splurge yourself, especially for a couples weekend, this would do it for both breakfast and lunch, which is exactly what we did for two days. This was one of the better stays we've had in NYC and would go back there again in a heartbeat. I recently had a three week work stay at the Parker Meridien on West 56th Street and it was a top notch stay from the moment I walked through the doors until my checkout. From the hotel's elegance, style and cleanliness to the friendly and professional staff, it was an extremely positive experience and I would stay at the Parker again in a heartbeat. This was my 1st trip to New York and to have been lucky enough to have chosen this hotel to stay made the trip outstanding. The customer service was outstanding; Norma's was the best breakfast experience and the Burger Joint was awesome. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. The only suggestion I have for them is to fix the business center; I could not print my boarding pass. However, the staff took care of it for me. This hotel is well located but very basic. If you are looking for any luxury would not recommend.\\nThe construction noise is very loud and starts at seven a.m. and stops about 5:45 pm. I was not told of the construction when I booked and would not have stayed had I known. I asked to move rooms and was not accommodated. Was given $75 compensation after asking. I would not recommend this hotel without construction noise. My wife and I stayed here from the 15th-19th December and were greeted by the marvelous sound of a jackhammer!! Like other reviews have mentioned during the week (07:30ish-19:00) there’s building work going on next-door and it's extremely hard to hear people in the lobby. When we asked we were told that unfortunately this was beyond the hotels control and reassured the noise would only last between those hours (which turned out to be true). To be honest though it worked in our favour as it encourages you to get up early and explore NYC's sites!\\nWe were given a room on the 18th floor and were impressed by the size and space of it. Plenty of room to put your bags, a bathroom large enough to stand and move without knocking into something! and the bed provided one of the comfiest sleeps we've had in a hotel (could of been all the walking that we done?!)\\nThe hotels location is fantastic, with Central Park being 2 blocks north and the F line subway located right next to the hotel and the E line only 3 blocks south all of NYC main attractions are easy to reach, although walking is the best way to view the city (IMO).\\nThe hotels Burger Joint was busy the whole time we were there so thought it must be great and were a little disappointed when we did eventually get one as it tasted like a regular homemade burger (better then a fast food chains, but nothing out of this world).\\nSo overall our stay was very pleasant and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a reasonably priced and comfortable hotel in NYC. \\nOur only complain is that on check-out our bill stated that we had 2 sambuca shots from the lobby bar, but had not been in, nor drank there so someone had used our room number and name to purchase them, which is worrying, but it was resolved promptly. Great location beside Carnegie Hall. 10 min. walk to times square. Rooms are larger than what I'm used to in NY. Close to everything, Cental Park, Met. Museum,Broadway etc. If you like comedy, try Carolines on broadway...monday nights are for' up and comers'. $15 cover 2 drink minimum and 9 acts....Awesome Everything was perfect from Front Desk to room assistance. Location was great - close to central Park, My Suite was spacious and clean We love the hotel. The staff is always courteous and we love the proximity and the view of Central Park. We stayed on the 37th floor. This was our 5th year in a row and we'll be back next year to hit Broadway and Fifth Avenue, yet again!! Other than spotty elevator service, our stay at Le Parker Meridian Mid-town was more than satisfactory. Pleasant personnle, clean rooms, flexible maid service, and location is excellent. The Le Parker Meridien is one of my favorite hotels when I stay in NYC. Nice and clean - spacious rooms, especially the Junior Suites. Good restaurant and especially great burger place located in the main lobby (cash only). \\nAs a runner - only 2 blocks from the 7th Avenue entrance to Central Park with a Starbucks outside each entrance (56th & 57th).\\nWarrning: The property next door is undergoing construction. The noise levels are beyond comforting from 7 AM to at least 7 PM. In the main lobby you can't hear the receptionist when checking in. I am told this will be the case until at least 3/2012. I have stayed at Le Parker Meridien several times before but the last two trips I made this month were spoiled by the roof top pool/gym being closed and the horrible jack-hammering noise from the building next door. To explain the severity of the noise, to the jack-hammering is not done by people on a jackhammer, but by Crane sized machines. I am sure the Le Park employees have lost a couple decibels of hearing because of that. Though the rooms I had the last two times were small, they were clean. They have this cool center console that they house the old Sony CRT TVs which are now much dated and need to replaced the with LCD TVs. At times I think the hotel management is more in love with the design of the console than providing current functionality it needs to provide. But overall, the rooms are beautiful, comfortable beds, with a staff takes a lot of pride in what they do. I was helped by this lady Annanida who was extremely helpful and professional. There is a not so fancysmanchy burger joint attached to the hotel, but being in the location there are plenty of good restaurants in walking distance - Nobu, Rue 57 to name a few. It is very close to Central park so if you are wanting to go for a morning run/walk it is the perfect place to get lost in. There are museums like the Metropolitan, MOMA, Guggenheim, Neue galleries in walking distance and ample shopping at Columbus circle and around 6th avenue. Best of all the location allows you to enjoy Manhattan the way it should be just far enough from the chain commercialized part of Time Square. Spent my ONE vacation day at the Meridien and wanted the day to end as fast as possible. In the winter the hotel shuts off their A/C system and only provides a heater. Their building is really old and hasn't been renovated in a long time so the heater would blast 80F at all times. I called the manager to help me out with this and the only thing they were able to offer was open windows (Its winter in NY, so freezing) or a plastic fan that makes noise just like the construction site next door. \\nSpent my night tossing and turning because of the noise outside (DT Manhattan cabbies honking) and after i closed the window it turned hot... Will never stay at the Meridien again and the lack of customer service from the hotel, not the starwood hotline guy, is making me rethink twice the next time I stay with a Starwood property again.. Just to let you know, I stay in hotels 4 nights a week for work and never had a bad experience like this anywhere else. Our tower room was small, but newly decorated and confortable. Should not have to pay for laptop connection given the price of the room. The staff was friendly and helpful, although some of the information provided by the concierge was outdated and inaccurate. Our first night's room, was small, old and uncomfortable, but the assistant manager agreed to credit 2000 points for the initial inconvenience. All in all we had a pleasant stay after the first night, and of course you can't beat the location. My husband and I, who are fans of Le Parker M and have stayed there before, were not exactly thrilled by the 7 am start of the construction at the lot next door, BUT we had a great customer experience that I wanted to share. We were only in NYC for a couple of\\ndays and running around on a tight schedule when we realized that we had an hour to return to the hotel for a much needed nap. The morning jackhammering had stopped, but the city was apparently doing some kind of work on the building that sounded like drilling right above our heads. After putting in our earplugs, to no avail, my husband called downstairs to ask about the noise. The front desk kindly offered to move us to another room, but that would have meant packing up, which would have taken up all of our nap time and defeated the purpose. Stephanie's well-thought-out solution? Letting us crash in an empty room on the other side of the hotel away from the noise. This is why we stay at the Le Parker Meridien NYC – great service – even under duress. Hopefully on our next visit the construction will be done. :-) I have stayed at other Meridien hotels where staff were more helpfull. I thought what was being charged for breakfast was a bit steep, more so because you were not sure to get a seat and had to wait in line behind people who had come in from the street.\\nThe room gave us a great view of central park but was not clean. Despite requesting this be addressed it never was. As we were there for a week we decided to clean the room ourselves. As a whole the hotel was not very well kept. It was dirty and looks tired. It is now trading on a name and given the hotels it is surrounded by that are comparative or cheaper it cannot be viewed as value for money. Stayed in the hotel for a about 5 days in Oct this year and booked at a pretty high room rate of more than $600. I had a problem with my flight schedule (who doesn't these days) and hence, contacted the hotel 24 hours before I arrived to informed them about my situation. Even though I was not cancelling my booking, they nevertheless charged me cancellation fees for 1 night, which is more than $600, which I thought was pretty unreasonable as I did contact them 24 hours before and I was going to stay anyways for another 4 nights. Anyway, reached the hotel and they were doing massive piling next door. Seriously the loud piling noise went on from morning till evening and it was terrible as I can't get decent rest in the pm. Even staying in the restaurants and lounge doesn't help and the best solution is to get away from the hotel. I tried to also print 2 pages of travel information but they did not have a proper business centre but only those automated ones that requires a minimal credit card charge of $6. The internet connection in the room was also terrible and it took a long while to download mails. Hence, for the price that I paid, I really feel ripped off, especially the additional room charge. I've been to many other hotels that offered better service and would be more understanding of traveller's dilemma. Decided at last minute to spend a weekend in the city for the holidays... We typically only stay at SPG properties and have stayed at a bunch of them all over the city. My wife and I like to stay at nice hotels, but are by no means travel snobs that nitpick over every little detail. Here are my thoughts:\\nThe Great:\\nLocation. We lived in the city for years, and still only live 15 minutes outside the city so we don't go 'sightseeing' but for those coming to the city for sightseeing and holidays, the location can't be beat. Right next to central park, walking distance to Rockefeller, Radio City, 5th avenue shopping, and an easy cab ride to any part of Manhattan.\\nStaff. The staff was great. Extremely friendly and professional without an ounce of pretentiousness. \\nThe Good:\\nThe lobby is nice as is the hotel bar. Beware of the crazy lines at 'the burger joint' (which I would avoid at all costs, but that is another review.)\\nThe Bad:\\nThe rooms. Regardless of whether you are paying or using points, the rooms just don't make the cut. Especially for a hotel that wants to categorize itself with the best in the city.\\nWe had a 'park view' room. Now, you can't complain about size, because it's NYC and rooms are small. It was an average sized room, bigger than the W's we have stayed at. It's the decor (or lack thereof) and the antiquity of the room that is unacceptable. From the old, non-flat screen television (even Holiday Inn's have flat screens these days) to the absolute lack of character in the room, it is one big disaster. Small conveniences like an ipod dock are non-existant. When you are paying as much as the hotel charges, you expect a certain standard, and it was not even close to being acceptable. I have read reviews that some of the rooms were modernized/upgraded, but certainly not the one we were staying in. I was even leary of walking around with my shoes off!\\nAnyway, if you don't care at all about the room and want a hotel that's pricey but offers a great location, particularly for the holidays, then the parker is for you. If you like having a nice, modern, comfortable room, then look elsewhere! My wife and I both travel a lot for work and probably each stay in hotels more than 40+ nights per year. We went to NYC for a romantic weekend without the kids and couldn't have been happier at the Le Parker Meridien. Lawrence at the reception desk took excellent care of us throughout the weekend and our view of Central Park was spectacular. We really couldn't have asked for more during our stay. Spent this past weekend at Le Parker Meridien, am definitely going to stay there again. The staff treatment from the front desk to the concierge was superb. The room was lovely and clean - we were in an updated room that lived up to the pictures. The location was just right for this visit - we could walk to the park, Broadway, 5th Avenue shopping, and lots of great restaurants in the area.\\nThe concierge was particularly helpful, managed several reservations for us and spent some time finding us the \"right\" restaurant on the one night we were a little late in trying to book.\\nWe did not eat at Norma's or The Burger Joint, but we did have great cocktails and nibbles in Knave. It seems as if Le Parker wants to be in the upper echelons of hotels, but there are some subtleties that stand out that just make the room seem average. This is our second trip in as many years during the holidays to NYC and there are better values out there.\\nFirst, I will say that the hotel staff were pleasant and accommodating. The doorman, bellman, front desk and concierge all were friendly and helpful when they were engaged for assistance. The concierge, in particular, when discussing reservations at a handful of places for my wife's birthday, helped us out. None of the restaurants we discussed at the concierge desk were available, but she did go and make a reservation at a similar location nearby asking only to cancel it if were not to our liking. I've seen concierges not take the initiative. \\nThe room, however, does need a bit of work. We had a top floor, Central Park suite, but it was dated. The wood paneling in the bathroom was watermarked, and the wallpaper had gaps that were very noticeable as it was white wall paper. It also had a stove, microwave and a fridge, but not a glass, fork, plate etc. to be found in the place. \\nThe electronics need a bit of an update. The bedroom television was an old tube TV that didn't have that great of a picture. In the main room, again this was a suite, the large flat panel tv required three remotes: one for the TV power and volume, one for the lodgenet box and yet another for the Sony surround system. The glow of the Samsung logo on the plasma did provide for a nice nightlight for our 3 year old sleeping in that room, though. \\nThere was also something going on with the heat. Neither of the thermostats seemed to actually control the temperature. We resorted to turning them off and just let whatever air was piping through the vent (clearly not turned off with the off switches) just flow. \\nWe did one breakfast at Norma's. The value just isn't there as there is no kids menu and even breakfast dishes started right around $20 and went up. A $24 waffle is quite a markup, but they had a nice citrus taste to them. \\nI will say, though, that the location can't be beat. It's within a few blocks of just about everything you can do during the holidays. For that alone, and a different choice in rooms, I would be back. We spent two nights and didn't have a single complaint. The room was not huge but a good size for the amount of time we spent in it. Very good service from check-in to check-out. Loved the rooms, for NYC they're spacious and were recently upgraded; the room controls were up to date and easy to operate. What was an unexpected surprise was the incredible water pressure! Not the sprinkle showers that make it hard to rinse but a torrent of water! The bed was low on the floor but incredibly comfortable and quiet! Great location as well, Starbucks right across the street and the F train was a stone’s throw away, three blocks from Central Park and a nice walking area to many shops and restaurants. Would come back here again! Amazing, amazing, amazing. For a new yor city hotel rooms are great size. Staff are thoughtful and informative. Norma's is as fab as ever - best break ie in town....ask for a high up room while the construction work is going on.....conciege and front desk were efficient and friendly without being robotic. Thus is our 5th time here on leisure, we will be back....thank you LPM. We were very happy with our stay. The location was absolutely amazing! The construction going on next door got a little noisy by 7am during the week but we were already up getting ready to enjoy the city and we expected a lot of noise in the city anyway so it didn't faze us but if you're planning on sleeping in, this may not be the place for you right now. Good space in the room, great location, friendly service...we will definitely stay again. Great hotel, fabulous service, amazing room and great location. Would definitely stay here again. This may usually be a good hotel to stay in but definately not at the moment!! We paid a lot of money to visit over a long weekend and were greeted by a hotel covered in scaffolding on the outside, and the noisiest building works you have ever heard. We had already been moved to the tower on the 29th floor and were wearing ear plugs when we were rudely awakened at 7.10 am on the Friday morning after Thanksgiving!! The floor in the foyer was actually vibrating and the noise was deafening! Even more disappointing was the complete lack of acknowledgment or advance warning about the noise/ works upon booking or in fact upon check-in. When we raised the issue with the front desk we received no help or apology, just an adament denial that this was anything to do with them...but as it directly affects their customers, a small gesture of compensation would surely have been appropriate in order to retain return customers - there was no reduction on price, or offer of a free breakfast, or even any coffee/tea making facilities? \\nThe leisure facilities and swimming pool were also closed for renovation (again no advance warning of this). Poor poor show! We may as well have been staying on the building site. The room was quite cramped but mainly due to the strange rotating bulky TV unit! Location was realtively good but that's about it I'm afraid. We found the staff to be most unhelpful. adequate but not worth the money, in my opinion. burger joint looked good, didn't try it Good visit. Nice rooms. Beautiful public spaces but UNBELIEVABLY crowded with holiday visitors. As large midtown hotel go... it was a positive experience. Don't know if I'd pay the prices they ask, but I used Starwood points and it was a great value for the number of points needed and also a fantastic stay. Nice, big, clean room with a great view of Central Park and great service from all employees. Would definitely stay here again. One of my favorite locations in NYC, right in the heart of everything. Hotel is no thrills modern and rooms are spacious and comfortable. Highly recommend it if staying in Midtown. We stayed at the Parker Meridian while attending the Architectural Digest Show. We arrived around 11am and the room was available right away. We were offered an upgrade to a suite for an extra $100, but did not except. We made our way to the 38th floor and opened the door to 3818 to be bought back in time approximately 10 years ago. The room had not changed in ten years. Which is not a bad thing, because the rooms are well maintained and modern design never goes out of style. The TV could be replaced to a flat screen though. The hotel was very busy which is nice to see, but we could not get into Norma's Restaurant for breakfast, it was a 1-1/2 hour wait. concierge excellent, often queues for reception, need to book breakfast at Norma's as soon as you arrive for whole stay or else ......no chance Location: in good corner of Manhattan convenient for business meetings in the city\\nAmbience: it feels like a good 4 stars hotel. A bit too busy with both tourists and businessmen flowing in. The lobby feels occasionally like part of a lobby of a train station.\\nReception: as it’s busy, there were queues to check in and check out I stayed there for a business trip for two nights over the weekend. The room was very nice - plenty of room, comfortable and very clean. The location was great - close to central park and within walking distance to 5th Avenue. Let me start by saying New York is not one of my favorite destinations (call me a Philistine, but I prefer suburbia to a metro area). Still, I would happily make my residence in the Big Apple if I could live in the Parker. From the art above the check-in desk, to the cartoons in the elevator, to the little blue lights outside the room, to the reading lamp next to the bed, all the little touches make a stay at the Parker exquisite! The junior suite I had at this hotel was fantastic. The room was spacious, especially for NYC, and very comfortable. There was also a really cool entertainment center set up that allowed me to swivel the TV around 180-degrees from the living room to the bedroom. \\nWhat I loved most about the hotel was the attentive staff. Shortly after arriving in my room, I started hearing a sound that chirped every 60 seconds. A quick search of the room proved that the sound was not coming from the room itself. Based on past experience in my own home, my guess was that the sound emanated from a smoke detector that had a low battery. I went out in the hall, and ascertained that the sound was coming from the room next door. I called the front desk, and within 10 minutes, a maintenance person was at my door asking about the noise. He went into the room next door and replaced the smoke detector battery right away. About an hour later, the chirping started again, although this time it WAS in my room (I guess my battery had an hour more juice in it than the one next door). I made another call down to the front desk, and just like the first time, the maintenance person appeared quickly and took care of the problem. After that, my stay was very smooth and I had a great night's sleep.\\nEven though the noise was annoying and required 2 calls down to the front desk, the issue was not really something the hotel could control for, and I was really impressed with the service I received when I reported the issue. Not only were they attentive to my needs once I was in the room, but the guy who checked me in was also very courteous and wrote his name down on my check-in papers so I could call him personally with any problems. I appreciate this level of personal service and I would definitely stay here again. This hotel really gives value in the city of New York. Well-sized rooms with comfy beds and good bathrooms. Location is tops. Plenty of breakfast spots nearby. This hotel is close to central park and have great views from their rooms. \\nWe stayed at floor 27 of 41 floors. Big windows so you get all of your view, big rooms and comortable beds. \\nGo all they way up to the top for an amazing view over central park! \\nThe service was good! I've never been disappointed with my stay at this hotel. The hotel is in a great location -- centrally located for whatever you're doing in the city and far enough away from the Times Square crowds. The rooms are always clean and service is always good. They also have a great gym.\\nWhile I do always love my stay at this hotel, I often times feel that it's a bit overpriced. And not that this makes a huge difference, but it would be nice for them to at least make the effort to upgrade the CRT TVs in the rooms with some sort of HDTV. EVERY other hotel that I've stayed at this year and last has HDTVs. Again, not a deal breaker, but seriously, the price of the rooms, I feel that this is the least they could do. My husband and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for a two nights recently. We had a nice price due to priceline. I was not overly impressed with this hotel though. Everything was nice, but there was no luxury in it. There were extra charges for using the gym, or the pool, a view was extra, staying in a higher level room was extra, etc. That being said, the room was clean and nice. The location was fantastic, we walked through Central Park each day we were there, were able to walk to both the Met and the Natural History Museum and found the subway very conveniently located as well. Just don't expect anything special from the accomodations... they are small and extremely basic. My husband and I visited Le Parker Meridien for 2 nights during St. Patrick's Day weekend. I got this hotel for $130/night through Priceline, an overall good deal in NYC. When I was assigned this hotel on Priceline, I was thrilled because we stayed here 2 years ago and loved the gorgeous indoor pool overlooking Central Park. I remembered that there was an additional charge to use the gym which was not ideal, but I was happy I could get a workout in the lovely pool. \\nWe arrived at the hotel on Friday night, and were checked into a king room on the 20th floor. It was very warm for March, and I remembered that during our previous stay (in May), we had some issues with the room being too warm. So when we got to our room, my husband called the concierge and asked if there was a way to make the room cooler. We were told there wasn't air conditioning available because it was too early in the year. They offered to bring up a fan and/or open a window. We did request the fan, which was delivered quickly and also kept the window open. Unfortunately, with the warm weather, the room just didn't stay cool and we weren't able to get good rest either night.\\nThe positive aspects of the room were the comfortable bed and that it was fairly large for a NYC hotel room. It was clean with modern decor. The bathroom was small, but that is typical in New York. The finishes in the bathroom were high end and looked nice, however, the tub was kind of bizarre as the bottom of the tub wasn't stuck to the floor. It bubbled up when I stepped on it. Also, the sink faucet was placed too far back on the counter so that the water barely made it into the sink. This is a small criticism that I probably only noticed because I design and remodel houses for a living, but clearly the hole for the faucet was drilled in the incorrect location on the counter. My overall thought on the room is that it would've been very comfortable and enjoyable if it wasn't so unpleasantly hot.\\nOur biggest disappointment came when we changed into our swimsuits and went up to the pool, excited for a swim, only to be told that the hotel now charges $15 per person/day to use it. We didn't have too much time to swim and therefore didn't think the fee was worth it, but also didn't want to pay just because we expected it to be free based on our previous visit. It just didn't seem right that there was a charge for both the gym and the pool. I would expect some free facilities for use at such a high end hotel. We originally planned to hang out at the pool a little before we left on Sunday, but without a free pool or gym to use, we decided to change our train home to an earlier time as it didn't seem worth it to spend the extra hours at the hotel.\\nOverall, I recognize that we still got a good price through Priceline for an upscale hotel on a busy weekend in New York. And our negative experience is partly due to our high expectations based on our last visit. I do like the hotel's location as it is a bit outside the insanity of Times Square. But I certainly wouldn't pay the regular rates or even use my hotel points to stay here in the future because of the room temperature issues and extra fees for the pool and gym. Our recent stay at the hotel was disappointing. The room was small and there was no view and the temperature was quite warm and could not be adjusted.\\nMost unpleasant was the new, unadvertised charge for the use of the roof-top pool. While the aquatic director was lovely and accomodating, the charge for a brief swim was not. \\nWe will not return to this hotel. Dear trip goer,\\nI found this hotel to have a polite but unhelpful staff that at times could be condescending. I found the rest of the hotel beautiful and in a great location near central park. For the amount of money it cost for a room, you just expect great service and the service and it was below average. I would suggest another hotel in a similar location if I could do it again. Lovely property, excellent lounge and great service staff. Weekday construction is over-the-top noisy, but ends at 5PM and doesn't happen on weekends, so bearable. Once the work is completed, this is a fabulous property. Will definitely return again. Got a great deal on this 4 star hotel in a perfect location in midtown south. Room was perfect, beds, linens, hvac so comfortable we slept until 11 next day. Checked out late but no trouble. Would defi itely stay here again. Love the espresso bar nave in lobby. Hotels that really care about your comfort and have authentic good karma are winning my business and starwood is one of those chains. The location is great ...especially if you like Central Park as I do. Close to two great subway stops to get uptown/downtown - east and west sides of NYC! Rooms were nice size, bright and the bedding and amenities excellent. Staff was helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable about the area. The fitness center is spectacular! Everything one would want for a great workout! I go to NYC several times each month and I've been looking for a consistently good hotel - location especially - and I found it in Le Parker Meridien! I stayed at this hotel in the first week of April 2012 and the overall experience was excellent.\\nThe rooms are large for New York (at least the deluxe room). The location is great, within a few minutes of many popular New York locations like Central Park, Times Square and Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Time Warner Center, Rockefeller Center etc.\\nAlthough the rooms weren't ready at 3 pm when we reached, the front office went out of their way to get them ready in fifteen minutes. One consistent thing that stands out is that the staff of all departments is very friendly and efficient. Housekeeping is excellent, bell desk service is outstanding, the doormen are very helpful - on our departure, one of them (at his own initiative) managed to find us an SUV taxi so that all our bags fitted into one vehicle. This general high standard of service makes up for any shortfalls in any of the other services, not that there were many. Room service did take very long and some part of the order was often either not correctly filled or not completely filled, but upon being informed of the error, they made up in the shortest time.\\nBeware though that the hotel has two very popular F&B outlets - Norma's, which claims to serve New York's best breakfast and Burger Joint, which serves great burgers and both are so popular that there are actually queues in the lobby to get in. Effectively, as a hotel guest, you are deprived of restaurants in the hotel. It will not matter because this is New York and the area around the hotel has more eating places than anyone can need!\\nOne sore point (unfortunately becoming common for many hotels, particularly in New York) is that wifi has to be paid PER DEVICE and not per room! With our having six devices in our group, this would have have worked out to over $100 per day! In the age of i-phones and i-pads, this policy is going to prove to be even more unacceptable to guests in the future. Wifi is now a necessity and not a luxury and charging unreasonably for it, is counterproductive. In my opinion, this would be the single largest reason, for me at least (and many others, I would think), to consider other options instead.\\nOne small comment about the swivelling television units in the rooms - these are grotesque (the designer must have been in the middle of a nightmare) and take away far too much space, but was informed that these are soon being replaced with wall mounted TVs. The other inconvenience is the lack of a coffee maker in the room, particularly when there is a $5 room delivery charge for even one cup of coffee, in addition to the charge for the coffee.\\nOverall, I think I would probably stay here again after prenegotiating wifi rates. This hotel is at a strategical location. You can visit Manhattan very easily. Staff is customer oriented, always smily. The rooms are bigs and the view is magic ! Le Parker Meridien is in a great location, closet to Central Park and 5th Avenue shopping. Subway is close as well. This location provides access to sites downtown, but in a location that is a bit nicer due to it's proximity. The new pool on the rooftop is also a great amenity!\\nBreakfast at Norma's is a must. One of the best things about staying here.\\nThe suite was relatively nice, but could use a bit of an update. Stay on a high floor for unbelievable views! best place I have stayed in New York. Great service. Definitely can recommend. Everything was lovely and we enjoyed all the attention to detail. The room was very comfortable and had everything we could think of. Quiet and comfortable for my twin 16 year old boys and for me. We had enough room in the room with a sleeper sofa in one room and a big bed in the bedroom. Bathroom was very nice. The staff is very quick to help out with pleasure. The rooms are cozy and the lobby area has a understated sophistication. I especially like the \"uniforms\" of the staff - stylish yet somewhat casual. It makes them very approachable.\\nthe bed is okay for someone with back problems- perhaps some comfort tops would be great! otherwise, they're comfortable. We stayed at Le Parker for two full weeks and didn't have the slightest complaint. We were located on the 29th floor (no park view) and we didn't have any issues with either outside noise or room temperature (it is true that it takes some time for the air conditioning to really kick in). \\nRoom was spacious and actually visually better than how it seamed from the pictures. Cleaning was amazing. Very efficient and discreet, we were never bothered, not even once in 14 days! \\nLocation is amazing, just look at the map and you will easily understand that. TV sets are old but I know that they currently replace them. WiFi is not free (only at the lobby and the bar) but that's the case in every NYC hotel that I checked with (I really don't get why this happens, free wifi is a plus for someone to choose a hotel nowadays)\\nLast but not least, sleep quality was very high, bed and pillows were perfect! We stayed at the Parker Meridien over Thanksgiving weekend. Hotel was in a great location - just a few blocks from 5th Avenue, FAO Schwartz, Central Park, etc. Room was large - we stayed in a junior suite with a king bed and a queen sofa, which worked out well with 2 kids. The room was clean, with a large desk and table, and large bathroom. The Burger Joint was great - great hamburgers, no frills. Only complaint was concierge - seemed uninterested in engaging as you walked up to them. Front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Some night time noise due to construction, but it is NYC - don't expect it to be quiet. Pool had amazing views - was well run. Nice touches for kids - gave them great NYC coloring book at check in. Overall great stay - we will be back. Love the staff, Cluade the bell man is the best, check in is kind and considerate, love to jog in Central Park just one block away. 5th Ave shopping is around the corner, cant beat the location! I loved the room, but I like a little more lighting...too dark 4 me! The decor very modern (Hence the low lighting!) Stayed in Jr Suite, nice size. Needed a bathrm fan (4people!), could not adjust your own room temp (had to call) Shower leaked onto floor....but other than those few things, great friendly staff, beautiful lobby, restaurant & bar and enclosed roof top pool very cool, great location, close to shopping and time square (walking distance just a few blocks) Would stay again, although try to get a room up high for a better view, we starred into an office building (which they called a \"city view\" 12th floor (need to get above 20 or so I guess.) Best coffee I ever had at Norma's. Pricey but worth it! Each time we are in New York , we stay at the New York Palace. When we made our reservations, Palace didn't have a room for our first night so we made a reservation at the Le Parker Meridien for one night.\\nWe have been to Le Parker Meridian many times to eat breakfast at Norma's which we love but never stayed at the hotel.\\nRoom was very small, small bathroom, dark and depressing room, furniture was old, door lock was broken, looked like somebody tried to get in to room so it was damaged.\\nRoom had an old style bulky TV that I haven't seen since long time. Bed was the most uncompartable bed I have ever slept in, I had a back pain rest of the trip.\\nHotel has a nice lobby area, nice bar and restaurant but nothing else. If you are looking for a 5 star quality hotel, do not stay here . We had a regular room, I am not sure there are better quality rooms in this hotel but I can not immagine. \\nWe will never go back to this hotel to stay but we will definately go to Norma's for breakfast. We stayed at the Parker Meriden over the Thanksgiving Holiday and loved it. My family had a junior suite as well as a King Standard room. The rooms were spotless, well appointed and comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful with our requests, suggestions for stores and restaurants and care of our two dogs who stayed with us. The \"Burger Joint\" is fabulous and such a \"funky\" place right off a gorgeous marble lobby. The burgers are so delicious and the service is fast and reliable. Norma's for breakfast was terrific and the Knave was a great lounge area for drinks at night. We would go back in a heartbeat. The location of the hotel is perfect-everything is so close by-theaters, Radio City Music -Russian Tea Room and Jack's Steak house on East 56th was within walking distance and delicious! We didn't get to use the pool but it looked beautiful and would have been good for our 14 year old if we had the time to use it. My husband and I stayed at the Parker Meridien for 8 days for Thanksgiving in NYC this year. We loved the location (56th Street, between 6th and 7th Ave). It's close to Central Park, close to 5th Avenue, and if you like walking, you can get anywhere in midtown. There is also a subway station right at the corner (6th Ave and 56th St) for the F train, and another station on 7th Ave for the N, Q and R trains. It's very easy to get anywhere in NYC. (Just ask the concierge for a subway map so you'll have it with you.)\\nThe hotel itself is very nice, and all the people we dealt with (front desk, doormen, bellmen, concierge) were friendly, polite and professional. We stayed in a suite facing the 56th Street side of the building on a higher floor, so we were not inconvenienced by the construction noise that others here have mentioned in their reviews. I think if you face the 57th Street side, that is where you will have the noise. (By the way, the construction is not at the hotel, it is in an adjacent building, so there is nothing the hotel can do about the start time in the AM, etc.). If you are an early riser and you're out of the room all day, you won't have an issue. According to the hotel, the construction will be finished in a few weeks. If you are concerned, I would suggest calling to speak withg a manager and requesting the 56th Street side, and on a higher floor. \\nAs for the room itself, the bed was very comfortable (firm), the decor was sort of \"Mad Men\" style, mid-century modern. The bathroom was user friendly and we had plenty of room for our toiletries. If you are accustomed to staying at hotels like the Peninsula, Four Seasons, or Ritz Cartlon, then you will not be satisfied as this is not that sort of hotel. I would say it is more along the lines of a nice Hilon or Sheraton, with a little more of a trendy twist, which is just fine for me.\\nRegarding the restaurants in the hotel, there is a groovy place off the lobby called \"The Hamburger Joint\" that attracts a local crowd that lines up to get in. There's also a restaurant called Norma's in the lobby that is just for breakfast/lunch, which is popular with locals. It's on the pricey side, for a special occasion breakfast or brunch outing.\\nAs with most NY hotels, you will be charged a daily fee for high speed internet access. I think it was $16.28 per 24 hour period. Also, if you need to use their business center computers/printers, there is no charge to print boarding passes but if you need to print other documents or use the computer for other things, there is a per minute charge. \\nWe didn't park a car there. I would definitely not recommend getting a rental car in NYC. You don't really need it and it costs a fortune to park. Just walk, take the train, bus or hail a cab, if necessary. \\nLast but not least, housekeeping was very good and very efficient. We never had to worry about coming back at the end of the day and finding the room not made up. It was always done and the room was always very well cleaned. We were here for a 2 night stay during Thanksgiving week. It was a pleasant surprise.\\nI was worried about the noise from the construction that's been mentioned in other reviews, but since we weren't sleeping in late, the noise that started around 7:30AM didn't turn out to be an issue (we had our own alarm clocks, a.k.a. the kids). We were on a higher floor facing north, so that may also have helped. I think if we were getting over jet lag and wanted to sleep in, it could have been an issue.\\nThe location was the best part of the hotel. We spent a lot of time in Central Park, which is just a block or so north. Nearby we easily walked to the Apple store, FAO Schwartz, and Rockefeller Center. The hotel is basically next door to Carnegie Hall, across the street from City Center, and a couple of blocks away from MOMA. There's also several subway stops within a block or two that got us where we needed to go.\\nThe room itself was also decent. A little larger than I expected for a New York hotel and up to date. The TV wasn't a modern flat panel TV, but we didn't come to watch TV anyway. The beds were comfortable. The main downside is that the room was a little warm, and despite lowering the thermostat, it didn't get cooler, but it was OK.\\nParking was expensive at $52/day, but that seems to be about in line with NYC parking.\\nOverall, it was a great stay and I would definitely consider making this my first choice for our next vacation to New York City. The location of the hotel was very nice. Across from the New York Theater Club, and just down the block from Carnegie Hall. The F train is a half a block away, as are the N, Q and R on the other side. The rest are easily walkable, and Times Square is a quick walk, as well. The room was large, and the bed was OK.\\nThat said, they nickel and dime you for everything. This may be one of the few hotels left that charge you for a disposable razor or toothpaste if you forget to bring yours. They charge for access to the hotel gym (not during our trip because most of the gym was shut down for renovations. Hence, no machines, sauna or jacuzzi), and they charge you $2 for water at the gym. The hotel cafe was outrageous for breakfast. We went once: she had a french toast and a cup of coffee, and I had banana pancakes and a glass of orange juice. Total price for that breakfast was $73.\\nThey provide a complimentary umbrella in the room, but no robes.\\nThe construction noise, as mentioned in many other reviews, starts every weekday at 7 am with some kind of pounding (not jackhammers, but much louder and which shakes the room). Virtually impossible to sleep through, even on the 20th floor, so don't plan on seeing any shows while you're in New York, or you will be massively sleep deprived.\\nThe concierge tried to steer us away from some wonderful, reasonably priced restaurants, and kept trying to get us to go to high-priced ones (He tried to send us to a dim sum place that had horrible Yelp reviews and a roughly $40-per-person average price).\\nIn all, the hotel is adequate, but nobody goes above and beyond to be helpful. And with an average per-night price close to $600, you really should expect more than adequate. Having a concert at Carnegie Hall, we found the location of the Parker Meridien very convenient. The staff was quite helpful and service was excellent. The room was small but well appointed, and the shower water pressure was the best I have seen in a long time. The room lacked bathrobes and hangers, but this was corrected quickly at our request. We learnt that the A/C system was only heat, so after a difficult first night, we had the hotel staff unlock our window so that we could bring the temperature down quickly for sleeping (they also gave us a fan), as we are used to do. Overall, I would come back to this hotel for its location and the good service. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, so I assume I always get a bit of TLC when I visit startwood properties- Not the case with the Parker NYC. This was my second time at this property and my last. First of all we enter reception and the guy at the front desk has a horrible cold. He is pale, coughing and sneezing. Just what I want to see on the first day of vacation, not to mention I have a child with me to be exposed to this. No upgrade available Im told. Ask for manager, he doesnt have a cold but proceeds to lie to me that they are booked at 100%. I take this standard room since its late stuff 3 of us in tiny quarters. Go to be at 2am, to be awaken at 7am by huge jackhammers and noises. NO ONE decided, even with my startwood status to tell me huge construction was going on at the hotel. We asked to be moved to a quieter room at 7am. At which point they moved me to a suite. I thought there were no more suites left? Liars! Still heard noise , rude manager told me she would not refund me. Called Starwood, got moved to W LEXINGTON, much better experience. W Lexington, front desk staff awesome, did everything they could to help me out.\\nPARKER NEW YORK sucks! Noisy, rude staff, liars, small rooms- dont go there. W Lexington rocks! I have stayed at the LPM a number of times over the last several years as a part of a large group (over 100 people).\\nThe hotel rooms are good for NYC as well as the location. On this occasion, I feel the hotel management and staff was deliberately and systematically deceptive regarding the monumental noise issue next door. I first became aware of it very abruptly at 7:00AM the first morning after arriving on a very late flight. To call it 'jackhammers' doesn't even begin to describe the Armageddon-like thumping that shook the room (taking shelter in the bathroom didn't help one iota). In stunned anger (I am a very heavy sleeper, btw), I called the front desk, and they were neither fazed nor apologetic. The person at the desk said the noise was from next door so it wasn't their fault - and they repeated that line again after I asked insistently WHY was I not informed this when I checked in??? They obviously knew of the issue - it had been written about on TripAdvisor for several months (I found out while searching the internet at Starbucks - their internet didn't work at all either, btw) and the lobby was literally shaking when I exited that morning. There was a note in the guest rooms apologizing for a completely different matter - some maintenance on their brickwork I believe - and that would start at 9:00AM I think - but they made NO mention of the far larger noise issue that eclipsed any noise from brick work, hiding behind that they were probably not legally responsible for the horrible construction mayhem next door. Not cool.\\n I found out after the fact that the hotel management had informed our management of the construction mayhem the SAME morning we arrived that there was a noise issue. We had this arranged for many months prior. This was an obvious effort to leave out crucial, and highly pertinent information as to the quality of the stay to a large repeat customer group. I have absolutely no patience for this and I will be advising my group (as many of us will) to take our business elsewhere in the future. The decision makers' mode of handling this, and lack of timely information, was highly deceptive and inexcusable, and the leadership in charge of deciding to handle this huge issue in this manner should be ashamed of themselves. \\nAnd to top it off, usually, when a hotel has a construction or major issue affecting the fundamental quality of life for the guests, there are some sort of promotional rates to compensate guests for the trouble, as well as to encourage guests to still come. This time around, the rate was by far the highest we had paid - the group rate was around $400 per night, and online it was around $500 per night. $400-500 per night to be surprised in the morning with a jackhammer in your ear....nice (the jackhammering goes pretty much straight from 7AM to 3PM with a lunch break). Weekends, not a problem. Weekdays, be prepared for the jack-hammer alarm promptly at 7:00 AM. Fortunately, we were out pretty early so it wasn't too bad, but I would suggest trying out the south (city view) rooms to see if they are any quieter. They will likely be cheaper anyway. Great service from the front desk and quick response to emails before we arrived asking if we could have connecting rooms since we were travelling with small kids (which they accomodated). Also got an extra rollaway bed for no charge. Location is perfect!\\nNorma's was good (all breakfast) but service there was a little lacking and slow. I would recommend Sarabeth's about a block away on Central Park South. Burger Joint does a good job of feeling like a greasy, hole-in-the-wall, which is exactly what you want when eating a great burger.\\nFor Starwood regulars, I would put the room quality between Sheraton and Westin on average. Comparable to a little bit older Westin maybe- comfortable, functional, nothing flashy. I was traveling with my dog and searched to find a good pet-friendly hotel. I thought it would be good to stay near central park. Because I had my dog with me, I was particularly keen to get an early check in, so i checked the availability the night before, and called more than once the morning of my arrival. Everyone said \"no problem\". When I arrived at 1:00 I was told absolutely no early check ins, leaving me with two hours to kill with my dog in Manhattan. \\nThe pool was closed but no one bothered to inform me during booking or check in that the amenity would not be available - once I asked, I was told it would be opening \"tomorrow\". when I returned to my room at 5:45 after a long rainy day in the city, guess, what, there had been no maid service. \\nThe room was too hot, and there is a big sign on the thermostat saying \"call us\" and when you call they send a tech to your room (not exactly private) to open a window. \\nThe staff never opened a door, never asked if i needed a cab, never offered any suggestions. I have stayed at many hotels in New York, from the Benjamin to the W and every one of them was a better experience. \\nSave your money there are many better options, on and off the park. Did not originally plan to stay here, but glad we made the change. Service at the desk was awesome. We were offered a very low cost upgrade to a junior suite as a traditional room would not be available for a few hours and we wanted to get settled. The room was large and clean with a pullout queen sofa so no air mattress needed for our son. Very modern look and feel. Location was great. Just between the Park and Times Square area without the feel of crowds (NYC was crazy everywhere else with early holiday shoppers). So easy.... will stay again on next trip to NYC.... great location.especially for theater. comfortable rooms. great beds. very good staff Great staff, great room, great location. I always choose Le Parker Meridien when I am in the City. Great location and friendly staff. The property next door was under construction so the noise early morning and at cocktail hour was deafening A great midtown base for a long weekend in Manhattan. Comfortable rooms, attentive front desk service and a cool lobby bar in the long corridor to 57th. \\nThe current construction next door makes for appalling weekday noise so I would check before hand if you are staying during the week We stayed at the hotel for 4 days in October and fortunately stayed over a weekend so that wew were not bothered by the very loud noise from the construction every day of our stay. I really liked the hotel and the room that were very large for NYC. The location was also excellent. \\nDispite all the excellent things about the hotel we will most likely choose another hotel for our next stay in NYC since there unfortunately is a lot of construction going on adjacent to the hotel on 57th street and since we had a room on 16th floor facing the construction it was impossible to sleep after 7 am on weekdays. We had no warning of the construction before we arrived at the hotel so we were not prepared to be woken up by veryb loud drilling and banging Monday morning.\\nI feel very sorry for the people working at the hotel at the moment since the noise from the construction was so loud that it was very difficult to talk to each other in the lobby area of the hotel. We were bothered by the noise in our room but at least we could just leave the hotel very fast when the noise started in the morning. The staff were stuck there all day. \\nAs I liked the hotel itself I would stay here again but only when all of the construction has finished. Let me preface my commencements saying I generally love the Le Meridien brand. I wish I had had a positive experience here because as much as I come to NYC, I would love to have loved this hotel. \\nI won't get into many details, but suffice to say I woke up w/ bites and told the hotel about it, they denied and claimed they had inspected and found nothing (same as other reviewers have indicated). I am not one of these bug freaks, clean freak yes, but not a bug freak. I received bites, my wife, a few inches away, did not, take it for what its worth.\\nnotes:\\n-great location (two blocks from park)\\n-very good sized room, upgraded to Jr. Suite (looking back wish we hadn't been)\\n-outdated decor/furnishings in room, terrible TV\\n-functional bathroom/shower\\n-nice lobby bar\\n-maybe property was new and fresh in 80's, but no longer\\nWith all the places in NYC, why stay here?\\n- There is a warning on the hotel website (you have to dig for it, its not on main page or anything, i think i finally found it under hotel conditions) and I discovered from the various reviews about the construction- after my travel agent had already booked the stay, so I wasn't quite sure what we were getting into. Yes it is loud, especially in the hotel lobby, but wasn't necessarily a bad thing for us- we were there to explore the city and had planned to be up early everyday anyway, so the 7:30am construction didn't ruin our stay. When we checked in we expressed our concerns and they advised we would be placed in a room as high as possible to lessen the noise (we arrived in the city very early and well before check-in). When we got our room later in the day we were on the 32nd floor with a fantastic view of central park. I felt the room was a good size, the bed was comfortable and very important, no bedbugs! It was starting to show it's age and yes it could use some updating and maintenance - the bathroom mirror was chipped, the shower leaked all over the bathroom, the bathroom ceiling had a lot of mold on it and the shower pressure was extreme, almost too much in my opinion.\\nThe hotel staff were great on every interaction, from getting cabs to providing places for breakfast, tips and directions, very polite and friendly, they certainly helped to make us feel comfortable and happy.\\nThe burger joint is a must try, but be aware of the long wait. We waited approx.30 mins on a Wednesday night at 10:30 and the place was packed, so nice to have the option to go back to the room to eat.\\nThe hotel bar is also great, prices are steep, but worth it! My husband had the best martinis of his life, and they were huge so worth the price.\\nNo major complaints, great location, especially for our first visit to NY, I did have higher expectations for the amount we were paying but overall was not disappointed. I've stayed at the Parker Meridian before and had a great time, but was there this week and there was a ton of construction going on. Really really loud banging at 7 am on a Friday morning. Was up on the 19th floor and woke us up. I could barely hear the associate as I checked in. I was told construction was from 7 in the morning until about 5:30 in the evenings. I'd stay away for a while. Great location and the staff were very helpful. There was construction going on next door and under the floors that at times was overwhelming. They start banging at 7:00AM so if you’re a late sleeper Mon-Fri you might want to rethink until construction is done. No work on the weekend I was there. I would love to stay there again! For a number of years, I have been regularely coming back to this expensive but well located NYC Hotel. The quality and friendliness of the staff always made me come back despite the high price (> $ 650 a night). This time a terribly vibrating and loud construction noise accompanied us during our stay: it was difficult withoud loud screaming to order a drink at the hotel bar.\\nWe felt very sorry for the hotel staff. It is ofcourse a sign of terrible management quality not to warn guests of the construction work and related noise. \\nAlso note that the swimming pool is also closed. Here again NO warning. \\nNeedless to say that we have deleted the Parker Meridien from our NYC hotel list. I stayed here every October for past consecutie four years. It was overall very good enough for business travelers. You can walk or jog around the central park. Kind reception, cosy lobby and nice bar \"knive\" where tasty cocktails and side dishes like fried olive and nuts. Norma's, a famouse brunch restaurant is excellent. I love morning smoothy. Booking is necessary esp weekend brunch. Great hotel, terrific late night bar, however the current construction is a real problem. Demand a south facing room over 56th St. The construction is on 57th. This was my third time at the Parker Meridien. It is as good or better than the other, more expensive hotels at which I have stayed - Essex House, Regency, Plaza. The rooms are good sized and the staff is very good. Tom and Jerry on the elevator = awesome. I had some Starwood points and used them to stay here last week for 5 nights. When I checked in there was a constant sound as if the subway were running through the lobby. I was told that there was construction next door and it would be like this daily. Because the noise was constant it actually disappeared after the first day; even though I could hear it in my room I slept through the first two hours each morning. The room and the employees at the entire hotel were excellent and I was very happy with my accommodations and the attention I received. I would definitely stay here again. We're always satisfied when we stay at this very European flavored hotel. Our latest stay was in October. Lots of foreign travelers, beautiful rooms, great location, oh, and a fabulous cheeseburger joint in the lobby. Sometimes some great deals too. Our room was on the 21st floor this time and although it had some flaws (weak AC and a sagging bathroom door that wouldn't shut without slamming) overall, we were very happy with our stay. Yes there is construction, yes the lobby is loud and no its not their fault. They were very helpful on the construction problem. I could not hear a thing in my room. The lobby was LOUD, but it was over by 530 pm. \\nGreat location for work and play. Easy to get around. The staff couldnt have been more helpful. We had our 8 year old and they met every kid request easily and quickly. Loved the cartoons in the elevator.\\nMy only grip was the anciet TV in he rooms. Its just strange. Its a very modern, hip hotel and then a TV from 1987? I didnt get it.\\nOther than that...and the daytime lobby noise...a very good hotel. Really enjoy the Parker meridien hotel - Rooms clean and spacious, amazing service throughout. Hotel is well located in Midtown. The burger place in the lobby is very good, would reccomend the hotel to all. Stayed for 8 days at Le Parker Meridien and had a thoroughly pleasant stay. Construction work going on next door but couldn't hear any noise in our room. Room quite spacious for NY standards and certainly very comfortable. Brilliant location close to park, shopping and short stroll to Times Square. Norma's great for breakfast but would advise to make a reservation. Consierge also very helpful and friendly. We just got back from spending 4 nights at the Le Parker Meridien and were pleased with the hotel. \\nThe pros -- the hotel is in a perfect location. Easy access to Broadway, Central Park, 5th Avenue and the subways. Our room was on the 26th floor and looked out over Central Park. The windows in our room opened so we enjoyed opening them at night and listening to the sounds of the city. The rooms were very comfortable -- nothing fancy but functional. The bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms were adequate. The shower pressure was outstanding! However what really stood out to me about this hotel was the staff. Everyone we dealt with was friendly, efficient, competent and helpful. The only meal we had at the hotel was at the Burger Joint. I recommend getting there early. On the weekends the line is long.\\nThe cons -- as the others noted, the construction. We arrived on the weekend so the first 2 days were quiet however the construction started early Monday morning. It wasn't really bothersome in our room but it was noticeable in the lobby area. We weren't at the hotel much during the day so it really wasn't an issue for us. The TV in our room was a good 10 years old and didn't work all that great -- some channels were snowy. We didn't go to NYC to watch TV or we would have contacted maintenance about it. I don't know if it was our room or the general reception.\\nOverall this hotel is excellent and I would stay again -- even with the construction going on. My husband surprised me with a long-weekend in NYC and we stayed at Le Parker Meridien. This place was great. We had a beautiful view of Central Park. The bathroom was a little small, but we were able to navigate just fine. Very modern type of hotel. I would definitely stay there again! We stayed at the Parker Meridien years ago and we were looking forward to returning this week. We are so disappointed. While the hotel can't control the noise from nearby construction, they can do something about the attitude of the staff here. Check-in desk was staffed by a rude and cold woman. We have three nights left here and if moving wasnt such a hassle, we would be long gone. Our first night here, the bed linens were dirty and had to be changed. The second day, housekeeping left trash in the room, there is no turn down service, no replacement of towels, they charge for internet service ( REALLY???? lesser quality hotels throw that in for free). While drying my hair, the hair dryer quit working and when we called for a replacement, the man came up and wanted to start reinstalling a new one, while i was in the bathroom with wet hair trying to get ready for an event! No hand held dryer in the hotel? The tv doesnt work well and is so outdated, the rooms are tired. What this hotel has going for it is the location, location, location. And Normas is great for breakfast. But if you want to feel any sense of attention from hotel staff, stay away. Let me start by saying that I stayed at this hotel free with Starwood Points. I make mention of that because I might review the hotel a little differently if I paid $400.00 per night for three nights. As it stood, I paid nothing.\\nThe hotel lobby is interesting- when you walk in, the check in attendants are at a small desk with MacBooks as their checkin computers. This sets the stage for the unique sleek look of the entire hotel. The feel of the hotel would be, I guess, art deco? Not sure. We checked in without wait on a Friday night around 8pm.\\nOur room was just fine, and decent size by New York standards. The bed was quite comfortable, and the bathroom, while quite small, was just fine. Two people cannot get ready at the same time in the bathroom, but I will say that the bathroom actually had a bathtub instead of just a small shower. That's unique for NYC. \\nThe TV is a tube TV, which honestly, didn't matter to me. I was in the room to sleep, and get ready. I watched a little TV when I first woke up in the morning, and at night to put me to sleep. So, while it may be unfortunate that this $400.00 hotel doesn't have flat screens in each room, that wasn't a big deal to me.\\nNeither then was the closet space that did not have a door. It is simply a curtain you pull back. Who cares? Seriously. \\nThere was a desk with a chair, and the drawers for storage were in the wallks beside of the desk. Unique, different, and it worked fine for me. \\nBurger Joint downstairs is incredibly crowded, incredibly great, and a must-visit. Cash only; just bring the burgers back to your room since you'll likely not find anyplace to sit. \\nWe did not visit the other two restaurants or bar there, but I've heard good things about both.\\nNow, for the real reason this hotel gets four stars from me. You have access from the hotel to both 56th and 57th streets. You are 2 blocks from Broadway, 6 blocks from Times Square area, 4 blocks from spectacular shopping, half a block from two subway lines, have countless restaurants within two blocks, pharmacies, grocery stores nearby, and the Park is two blocks away. Simply put, this location is great for Midtown visits. You are in the middle of it all.\\nI've read some complaints about jackhammering, and the hotel can do nothing about this. We didn't hear it at all until Monday morning at 7am. It was quite annoying, and checkout proved it was loudest in the lobby. But I mean, call ahead and ask them if they are still doing construction. It's my understanding that it's during the week and in the morning. Plan accordingly.\\nOh, and this hotel has a pool on the roof that we didn't use, but we did go see for the view. Best view you can get of Central Park for free (and legally) I would bet. \\nAll in all, I loved my stay here. I may be biased, since I collect Starwood Points with my American Express. I bet that I make this a regular place to visit, since the location is so perfect. Definitely recommended. Just the opposite experience of Joan F. Top notch management team at this hotel. Everyone at all levels were genuine in their desire to be helpful which these days is a rare experience. There was construction noise on our park side room and management did a great job of moving us to a nicer room on a higher floor with no noise. They knew how to solve the problem and did.\\nFront desk very helpful, maids helpful, pool staff and health club staff knowledgeable and helpful, ditto for Norma's and the lounge. Usually stay at the Westin or W. The service here is top notch. I stayed at the Meridien in Manhattan for one night and have mixed feelings about it. The positive is definitely the location....excellent for walking to all points of midtown, including broadway, central park, 5th Avenue, etc. The main negative was the room, which needed updating. The bathroom door stuck and the walls had some small stains on it. The room itself was ok (comfortable beds) but the TV was old. Honestly I would have expected the room to be nicer, given the reputation of the Meridien. The other negative was the concierge to whom I spoke about restaurant recommendations. He had an attitude and seemed annoyed that I was inquiring. The following day I spoke with a different person who was much more helpful. I'm used to travelling solo, but went to NYC with my nephew and niece (both under 11) for four days. The Parker Meridien accommodations (junior suite) were comfortable and grown-up (relatively roomy bathroom with sleek fixtures, desk and ergonomic chair, 2 couches (1 pull-out), good-sized living area and sleeping area). At the same time, the hotel was completely kid-friendly. The in-house burger joint served quick, tasty burgers and fries, and the cafe/restaurant was a less casual sit-down option that still could handle children. All staff were friendly and helpful. Room service orders were right on the money every time. Tom & Jerry cartoons on the monitors in the elevators provided a good distraction at the end of long sight-seeing days. The rooftop pool is a neat concept, but it's very small and not much room for kids to play -- shape expectations accordingly. Dean & DeLuca and Starbucks are directly across 56th, and there's easy access to multiple subway lines. One of the Central Park playgrounds is about 6 blocks away (the Park's about 3 blks from the hotel, and the playground is about 3 blks into the Park). Central Park Zoo is an easy walk, as well. There is construction next door that makes the lobby a noisy place to be, but up in our room, we could not hear it at all. All in all, our hotel experience was excellent, and I'll be staying there again, with or without kids in tow. My wife and I used to live in NYC. We have been in San Francisco for many years, but our hearts have never left NYC. We take a week every year to go back and re energize in NY. It is almost a pilgrimage - so you can imagine my concern when we walked in and heard the loudest racket- pounding, jack hammering, clanging I have ever heard inside a hotel - ever. \\nThere was major foundation work going on next door. I felt so sorry for the employees. I listened to how they handled the many guests who all had major concerns about staying and I must say they were completely empathetic to the situation and committed to making each guest comfortable in their decision to stay. Or help them find another Starwood property to go to. Without blowing smoke at them I might add. \\nThe woman who checked us in was able to get us on a high floor far away from the racket, and I must say our week there was one of the quietest I have ever experienced in NY. Either living there for 6 years, or visiting for business for over 25 years.\\nThe level of genuine concern and helpfulness started at check in, continued through to the maids, the doormen, the concierge, the maintenance staff, the bartender and waitresses, and everyone we ran into at this property.\\nWe usually try to stay at one of the many lovely boutique hotels in NY, but I think the days of sleeping around are over. We've found out 'go to' hotel in the city from now on.\\nGreat job to the team at Le Meridien! Our room had a peak view of Central Park, which was nice. In the morning, we got up and took a stroll through the park... can't beat the location. The room was clean and modern, we had a wonderful stay. The pros of this hotel--\\n1. Location (a few blocks from Central Park and off 6th Av.)\\n2. Relatively modern/updated (flat screens, well-lit bathrooms)\\n3. Quiet (on 33rd floor)\\n4. Quick service (at check in, check out, and room service)\\n5. Good room service food (healthy and less healthy options)\\nThe cons -- \\n1. dated ventilation system (but Engineering will open the window)\\n2. slow and too few elevators (making for a wait to depart)\\n3. Construction occurs during day - 7 - 3. Very very loud.\\nIn short, if the price is good compared to others, the location is great and it's clean. Gym looks good, although didn't get a chance to use it (there is a small fee). All in all, nothing unique to recommend it above other hotels in the area, like Sofitel or Muse. But no reason to avoid it either. I think a hotel has a responsibility to let guests know that there is major construction going on upon check in. Waking up to jack hammering and not really knowing what is going is pretty disturbing. I was meeting a colleague for a breakfast only to realize that the lobby was so noisy there was no way we could even hear ourselves speak. We went to Starbucks across the street. I know that construction is not always avoidable but it is inexcusable not to be told this upon check in, or there could have been a note in the room. On other points this hotel is mediocre at best and for the price you can definitely do better in NYC. I have stayed at this hotel on multiple occasions in the last 7 years. I like this hotel because of the location - it is just 2 blocks from Central Park, is close to almost all subway lines and you get Starwood Points but the hotel is now a bit dated and the rooms need refurtbishment. **A word of caution** there is currently construction going on next door to the hotel and the pounding starts promptly at 730AM. I was on the 22nd floor and could still hear it. I had friends eating at Normas and they said that the noise was unbearable, making it impossibly to have a conversation. I asked the front desk and they said the pounding is expected to continue until the end of October 2011.\\nPros:\\n- Great location - near Central Park and almost all subway lines\\n- Rooms are reasonably large for NY standards (even the most basic rooms)\\n- Check-in and check-out are reasonably fast\\n- Norma's (the restaurant downstairs) has amazing breakfast/brunch\\nCons:\\n- The bathrooms are small and if you don't get a suite, the bathrooms have that gross thin fabric shower curtain that gets smelly over time\\n- One sink only in the standard rooms (I can't remember if there are 2 in the suites or not).\\n- This hotel needs refurbishment. The rooms still have CRT TV monitors!!\\n- This hotel is not very international travel friendly - no built in adaptor plugs into the sockets\\n- The broadband sucks. They use a 3rd party provider (which bills you separately) and I kept getting bumped off and having to call the 1-800 number to re-set the IP address\\n- I think it's really tacky and unprofessional the way the guys at the entrance of the hotel who help you to get taxis and help with your luggage are constantly counting their tips in front of guests\\nTips:\\n- Try and get upgraded to a suite on one of the higher floors\\n- With the construction going on now, you definitely want to be on a higher floor Major contruction project next door causing a ridiculous amount of noise!! I cannot believe the hotel can possibly remain occupied with this going on. A little warning to potential guests would have been nice, but instead we were abruptly awakened at 7:00am every weekday to an unbearable jack-hammer-like noise that literally didn't stop until 5:00 pm. The noise is heard throughout the hotel (lobby, gym, meeting rooms, restaurant) is so loud that it is nearly impossible to have a conversation, let alone try to sleep through it. This could possibly explain the somewhat frazzled attitude of the entire hotel staff. The noise, by far, was what compelled me to write a hotel review, but there were so many things to dislike about this hotel!! To avoid an overly lengthy description I'll try to be brief:\\n• Unwelcoming arrival -- front desk attendant seemed flustered and struggled for quite a while to find the room with 2 beds that we had reserved, finally did.\\n• Opened the half bottle of wine in the minibar only to find that there were no wine glasses in our room, (although there were shot glasses in the bathroom???). We were told that there would be a delivery fee if we wanted wine glasses. Nevermind.\\n• Went to \"The Burger Joint\" in the hotel... there were no tables available so we asked if we could take the burger to a quiet table at the hotel bar so we could enjoy it with a cocktail. We were told we could not bring \"outside food\" with us, even though it is from inside the hotel.\\n• Forgot my razor so I called housekeeping to bring one up... (pretty standard for a hotel to provide a disposable razor if requested). Nope, razors are $10.00 at the 4-star Parker Meridian. Opted to buy a pack at the market down the street.\\n• No coffee pot in room or complementary coffee in the lobby. Small cup could be purchased for $5.00. Thankfully Starbucks is right accross the street.\\n• Front desk attendant gave me an outdated fitness class schedule, so I woke up early to get to a class that wasn't scheduled for another hour later. Also hotel guests have to pay a daily fee of $10.00 to use the facility.\\n• Trying to relax a little in my room on the 8th floor only to glance over and find a man on scaffolding right outside my window!! Apparently there is yet another project going on at the hotel (also extremely loud) and you should keep your window coverings completely closed if you want to assure your privacy.\\n• Saturday morning fuel truck causes the entire hotel to permeate with the smell of gas. Front desk attendant acts like this is totally normal.\\n• Requested turndown service on sleeper sofa... Never happened until we got back late and called twice. Would have done it myself but didn't have linens or pillows for the sofabed.\\n• Received bill at checkout... multiple minibar charges were listed, although we never opened the minibar after the first day for the wine.\\nThe Upside:\\n• Complimentary shoe shine\\n• Rooms were clean and comfortable (although revolving tv cabinet was huge and took up too much space in the room).\\n• Because of the loud noise from construction, we were moved to a different room higher up and on the other side of the building. You still knew when it was 7:00am because you could hear the construction begin but the sound could be muffled with a pillow over your head.\\n• All incorrect minibar charges were taken off our bill without question.\\nBecause this was not an inexpensive hotel, I was so disappointed. I have no idea how it could have a 4-star rating given the lack of ammenities and extra fees. For these reasons, and especially because of the contruction noise, I would highly recommend staying elsewhere. Good Location, main entrance is off 56th Street not 57th as is their address.\\nMust have a hamburger from the \"burger joint behind the curtain\" in the lobby. It is the best you will get, but have your order ready when you get to the front of the line as they as fast pasted and not tolerant of out of towners. The whole hotel has attitude, but it is New York. Great hotel if you are into tennis as a lot of players for the US open stay here from end Augsust to mid September, so get your booking in early if travelling at that time. While we checked in, I witnessed three people complaining at the front desk about three separate problems with different rooms. That made us wary, of course, but then we had our own problems. Immediately we were told that there was major construction going on, but they couldn't move us from the side of the building with construction. The construction was running from 7 am to 5 pm every day. Luckily our room was on Floor 10, but in the lobby and the lower floors it was throbbing and deafening. You literally had to raise your voice to speak in the lobby. Later that evening, we learned that there was no air-conditioning in the entire hotel, even though it was the first week in October, and 75 degrees outside. And the employees couldn't care less about our complaint. Excellent hotel. Great location and very friendly and helpful staff. Loved the penthouse pool and good facilities. One down was that my wife found the bed uncomfortable and a bit 'lumpy'. A must is The Burger Joint, tucked behind the curtain to the right of reception. Choose your time as it is tiny and gets busy very quickly. Overall would heartily recommend and would return without hesitation. Very bad check in experience, broken lock on the door, no robes in the room. Under construction. But the most annoying thing was very unapologetic response from General Manager and staff. Very arrogant and made it seem like it was my fault. Definite down-turn in quality. Very good value for a 4 star hotel in a great location near Central Park, Carnegie Hall, Lincoln center and the shops at Columbus circle. Check in was very quick and we were immediately taken to our room on the 21st floor. Room size was very generous for NYC standards - plenty of space, large windows with city view. The bathroom was a bit on the small side, but very functional. Room was very quiet and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. Other amenities that are available, though we didn't use them: a penthouse level pool and Gravity, the hotel's gym with all sorts of work out classes and equipment (quite a perk). \\nI have to say, everytime I passed a staff member in the hallway or elevator, they ALWAYS had a smile and a pleasant greeting. And the concierge managed to score us 3 last minute seats at Atlantic Grill for dinner before the opera....after calling all 10+ restaurants in the area of Lincoln Center. The staff really do make quite an effort to be helpful and courteous.\\nThe only negative of our stay was actually what I had thought would be a positive: Norma's. I made reservations for 11:15 on a Sunday morning. However, apparently \"reservations\" is just to get a better spot in line. We were not seated for 30 minutes...and only then because we parked ourselves in front of the hostess until she found us a table. There was no apology, or even a complementary orange juice! There were many others in the same situation as our party. The breakfast itself was good....but we ate under the stares of many customers crowded at the hostess station, presumably past their \"reservation\" time as well. \\nOverall, the hotel was great and I would definetly stay again....but would skip Normas. do NOT go there until the adjacent construction is complete. Jack hammers started at 7am...on the 16th floor...ripples in the bedside glass...Bose noise canceling headsets and earplugs no help. No warning upon checkin it was happening. No apology from hotel staff.\\nBAD SERVICE - BAD stay I usually stay closer to Times Square, but really enjoyed the proximity to Central Park & shopping. We actually found ourselves taking fewer cab rides this trip since it was so easy to walk to Rockefeller Center as well as Times Square and the theater district. At the end of the evening we really enjoyed the very cozy hotel bar. \\nThe rooms were large by NYC standards, and the beds are awesome. \\nThe construction noise next door is deafening, however, and it seems Sunday is the only \"noise-free\" day. Good choice if you are going to be out of the hotel all day, but stay elsewhere if you hope to work from your room. My 7 girlfriends and I stayed at the Parker Meridien for 4 nights mid September, 2011. It was a fabulous experience and we were treated like royalty. I needed a doctor for an eye problem and they immediately put me in touch with a dr. within walking distance from the hotel who took me right away. He was fabulous. I even spoke to him on a Sunday. The concierge people were wonderful and booked restaurants and bus trips for us. There was even a limousine parked outside the hotel which we used several times....it was easier and cheaper than two taxis. \\nThe rooms were clean with very comfortable mattresses and pillows and thick towels. Flat screen tv's too. We even had one hour of free wi-fi in the lobby. We had breakfast at Norma's and it was very reasonable because we shared the servings which are very large.\\nThere is also a very unusual hamburger restaurant behind a curtain in the lobby. The Burger Joint.....$7 hamburgers which are delicious, one of my friends had three hamburgers on three different days! You have to wait on line and there is no table service but it is an experience and fun!\\nThe location is perfect...near the MOMA, Central Park, where we walked every morning, shopping, restaurants and a short walk to Times Square. There is a Starbucks directly across the street which we made use of every day. \\nThe indoor pool on the top floor is amazing with wonderful views of the city. There are lounge chairs around the outside deck for relaxing. \\nWe were warmly welcomed and Anandi worked very hard to get us rooms near each other and on the floors that we wanted. \\nIt is a wonderful lobby to people watch and many people from the United Nations were staying at our hotel because there were meetings at the UN that week.\\nI would not stay anywhere else in Manhattan! Great location, Construction next door was HORRIBLE (luckily, I just happen to being earplugs so we could sleep). It would have been nice to get a better room rate for that inconvenience :0) We were able to check in early after an overnight flight (but were charged $250 extra) The Omni Berkshire let us check in early for no charge since the room was available, the Omni was A LOT more fun and friendly with my kids also. Hotel was not nearly as \"family friendly\" as they advertise, my children seemed to be an annoyance more than welcomed... that was disappointing. Housekeeping broke my laptop, I think they must have vacuumed over the top of the case or something??? \\nThe room was a nice size, especially for NYC. Bed was super comfy, shower was huge, although not having a tub was a bummer with a 3 year old. Overall, nice hotel, not as \"superior\" as expected though. This was my first time at the Parker and I no longer will be staying at the Paramount or the Hilton on 6th Ave or the Sheraton. Everything was A1 wonderful: the beds were the most comfortable of all NYC hotels I've stayed in (and I've stayed in a lot), the down pillows, the friendly staff, the immediate responses to housekeeping requests, the classy bar with the great music and generous drinks, even the fast umbrella provided by the concierge when we noticed the sudden rain... I could go on but I have to get back to work. Thank you for making my 4 days in NYC more of a delight than a normal business trip.. The location is good as other reviewers have noted, but the rooms are small and travel with small children here I thought was challenging, there is no floor room for them to spread out. However, it was walking distance to FAO Schwartz & Central Park, so that helped. While we were there considerable construction was taking place next store and the sound of the jack hammer under the lobby was head-ache inducing, certainly loud enough to make you want to avoid eating in any of the hotel restaurants, so ask about that. Food for our dog (1 lb of ground beef) was $18, then with room service & automatic tip & delivery charge, it ended up being $30! So while it was nice to have the option of ordering dog food, it was the most expensive ground beef I have ever bought! The pool is nice, great views, well maintained. If you are traveling with children, do not ask the concierge for help, the 2 restaurants she directed us (we asked for kid friendly places to eat) did not have kids menus and one of them (Bistro Milano) served our toddlers milk in wine glasses! Plus there wasn't another kid around in either restaurant. Maybe New Yorkers don't dine out with their children?? Great location, nice staff,Large rooms by NYC standards- They even had our room ready fro check in at 9:30 AM!!!!! Wow.- Great breakfasts in Norma's - ( bu a tad on the expensive side) This hotel was chosen for location and because I was redeeming my Starwood points. The hotel is clean, modern, good facilities such as the gym/spa and espresso bar. It's a shame there is no free wifi in the hotel rooms, and sometimes we had to wait a while for the elevators, but the rooms and service were excellent! Staff were friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us! Would definitely recommend!! Many thanks - definitely \"Parker perfect\"! If you want location without extortionate prices then Le Parker is a reasonable choice. Its a bit more expensive than places such as The Manhattan but the step up in quality is very visible. Walking distance to 5th Avenue and Times Square and my room overlooked Central Park. Room was spacious for NYC and I did not notice any of the cleanliness issues that I had previously read in some of the reviews on TA. There is a car park exactly next door and a Starbucks across the road. I would definitely stay again whether it be for business or leisure. I recently stayed at the Le Parker Meridian in NYC in Sept of ‘11. \\n1. My flight was a red eye and arrived early in the morning, around 7AM. I arrived with my wife and my mother inlaw. All of us were exhausted from a long flight. When we got there, they first told us our room would not be ready until at least noon or 1PM! That’s fine, if they would allow us to go into another room to at least rest and freshen up, but they would not do that. They had room available, they could of let us sleep and have housekeeping come and clean up after we left, but they refused. \\n2. I arrived with 3 guests. But the room I booked, had two beds, but 2 small beds, according to the hotel staff (Who were very rude btw). They offered me to upgrade to a single king with a roll away. Originally they wanted $50/night for that roll away cot. They said they could upgrade me to a room with a King and a Pull out Queen for $75/night. I said, \"If you are willing to waive the $50 for the roll away, and want to charge $75 for the pull out, why not call it even at $25/night and we got a deal.\" They said, NOPE. And they would only upgrade me for the roll away bed. (all this was AFTER #1). \\n3. The room itself was horrible. The bed was from 1982. With disgusting old covers. I felt like we were staying in a Days Inn. Not a Starwood Category 5!! The TV was also from 1980 and took up half the room. \\nOverall, the Hotel management and guest staff were rude and the room itself was disgusting. I have pictures if you like. I paid with my Starwood Points and I would very much like my points back. In fact, we were so disgusted with this hotel that we checked out a day early and checked into a HILTON so we would not have to sleep uncomfortably anymore. I paid cash for the Hilton. Just to let you know how dissatisfied I was. That I would be willing to give up a free night in your hotel rather than stay. It's my 30th review, and I'm running out of ways to describe a room. \\nI've now stayed in over five hotels in the city over the past two years - four of which were SPG properties. The Westin is still my favorite but I did enjoy my stay here (minus the jackhammering next door). \\nMy room was a junior suite with three closets, a minibar, a comfy couch and large workstation in the \"living room\" and a very large bed. Annoyances: the bathroom was too small and the water was too hot out of the sink tap. \\nThe bed - fell asleep instantly. Couch - fell asleep there too. Towels - nice and soft. But my absolute favorite - the Peter Thomas Roth bath items. I generally hate hotel soaps and shampoos (including the Westin's). They dry my hair and skin out but this brand was very good that I took them home with me.\\nThe lobby is a bit too nosy for me, but very formal looking. I couldn't figure out the decor (silent movies or cartoons in the elevators) or the staffs' uniforms. I wanted to try Norma's but it was too noisy with that construction next door. \\nOh the \"business center\" is nothing more than two computers and a nice printer. \\nSo why do I prefer the Westin Times Square? The lobby is more spacious and nicer. The bed is just slighly more comfortable but the location is just better. We stayed for 10 days in a standard room on 27th level. The rooms are well equiped, the bathrooms seem to be older. The reception and concierge team is very friendly and helped any time. In the lobby, there is a smell of kitchen and the prices for breakfast are too expensive. But overall, we would choose Le Parker Meridien again. What our travel agency in Switzerland would have expected, is that they are informed about the noise of construction and that the roof pool was closed. This was sad, as we would have loved to use the swimming pool whilst being there - temperatures would have allowed it. Having stayed at various other Starwood hotels in the past 5 years (most of the W's. St Regis, Westin Times Square etc.), I thought it was time to try something different - so we went for the Le Parker Meridien using the 5-for-4 points deal.\\nAll in all, the hotel is actually pretty good. Supposedly famous burger joint on the ground floor was fun (and ridiculously busy), internet was good, rooms were fine, didn't eat in the restaurant, bar area was also fine. Location is excellent for walking, tube and bus journeys. Top-floor pool was cold, so was therefore of limited use on an otherwise freezing cold December week.\\nI'm going to give the hotel 4* of feedback as it was very good but not excellent. The bad news - Meridien doesn't make any mention (during reservation or on web site) that there is full-on construction next door (2 excavators breaking concrete ... has to be experienced to believe)\\nThe good news - I arrived early & Andrea graciously checked me in and got me a better (bigger room)\\nMore bad news - What would prompt my first TripAdvisor review? Security guy rudely telling me I can't eat my pumpkin bread in the lobby while drinking my coffee \"this area is for drinks only\" ... $610.00 for 1 night w/ this racket & this is what you get from the staff?? Amazing!! I stayed here in mid October for 4 days and felt the hotel was overpriced for the quality of the rooms. At some point the hotel was modernized but now it feels beat and in need of upgrading. There is construction right outside of the hotel that makes it impossible to enjoy the lobby and restaurant. There is a very large gym in the basement that feels dark and dingy. The burger joint which gets pretty good reviews is overpriced with food on par with an In and Out Burger but at twice the price. To sum it up I would stay at the W or if I am splurging the St. Regis. The hotel is in a great location, just a few blocks from Saks and great shopping on Fifth but it's not a great hotel. Stayed here weekend of 9/23 and was surprised at how accessible everything was, despite my many trip to NY, this mid town location was ideal! Steps away from the subways, Starbucks across the street, 24 hr. deli's for a late night snack - a block away. Walk to Central Park - 2-4 blocks, shopping, dining (Russian Tea Room), Lounges (Lavo, Dream Hotel, Hudson) all were within a few block radius and very safe to walk around day or night.\\nThe staff was friendly and attentive to our needs, the rooms are small, but then again its NY, unless you're in a suite, its always going to be a small room, however; the bath amenities make up for it. \\nDefinitely sign up to be an SPG member, it has its perks like early check in, upgrade and late check out's. Look for Emilie at the front desk who will take care of all your special requests, or see Michael - Concierge who will point you in the right direction for dining and a night out on the town. My wife and I had an awful stay at the Parker Meridien for a mixed family/business trip. Another reviewer commented that nothing has changed in a year and a half. For us, nothing has changed in two and a half years. Following a rocky stay in early 2009, I gave the hotel a long hiatus to get things sorted out before giving them their much requested second chance. I even called the General Manager’s office early in the week of our arrival, just to remind the executive staff that we were giving the hotel a second chance and while we didn’t need any special favors, we wanted a trouble-free stay. We had anything but and the hotel will not be getting a third chance.\\nOur arrival was delayed more than four hours out of LA by American Airlines, so we arrived at 11:30 pm in pouring rain. (I called ahead to let the hotel know of our delay so that they would know to expect us very late.) There was no doorman to meet the taxi, so we hauled our own luggage out of the taxi and into the hotel, getting nicely soaked in the process. There was no recognition that I was a repeat guest or SPG Gold by the front desk staff practicing its ennui - it's not really necessary but it is appreciated to be recognized as someone who helps keep the surly staff employed. \\nUp in the room things were no better. The wireless Internet service still does not work after all this time and frankly I don’t care if the hotel signed a bad long-term service contract – that’s their problem and not mine when I am being charged $16 a day. The desk chair was broken, there was no turndown service for the first two of our four nights, ice was not provided even when there was turndown, dirty dishes were not removed from the room, we were not provided a morning newspaper despite the SPG Gold status (the lie I was told was that the papers were at the elevator which they were not and never were, on any floor), and on the two occasions that I needed to contact the concierge I was put on hold once for six minutes and the second time for almost five minutes and the attitude was one of utter annoyance (something that I had also encountered back in 2009).\\nHaving had enough of this twice in a row over a period of more than two years, I attempted to contact the General Manager in the middle of our stay, only to have his secretary challenge me on why I thought the staff was indifferent. No apology – just a challenge. When I told her that I had just explained the problems to her and did not think she should challenge me, she told me to “Have a nice day” and hung up on me. That prompted me to call the hotel operator and ask her to connect me to SPG Corporate Services. The operator told me “We don’t provide that as part of our service” and she too hung up on me. Obviously, someone is running his hotel teaching his staff that they can misbehave without fear of retribution. So, I called SPG Elite Corporate Services myself and opened a formal complaint right then and there. The GM was never available thereafter to speak with me for the duration of our stay and once we left the hotel I am sure we were completely forgotten by him.\\nSeveral days later, I did receive an email from a guest relations manager asking for yet another chance and offering me an upgrade. The hotel has had its two chances and since this never was about being upgraded to a junior suite, I don’t know why I would need a larger room in which not to have functioning Internet, turndown and ice, all served up with indifference. \\nFor a hotel that puts on such false airs, it is curious that it thinks it amusing that its “Do Not Disturb” sign is emblazoned in New Yorkese: “FUHGETTABOUDIT”. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do with this hotel. I originally booked into a room with 1 bed, but a friend decided to join me. The staff was very helpful on moving me to a room with 2 beds to make our stay more comfortable. Unlike other hotels in NYC, the room was what I would consider a full/regular size.\\nLocation is ideal just a few blocks from Central Park and the staff was very friendly and helpful. There are several things about this hotel that are quite good...the location is fantastic, the pool area has a stellar view, the lobby area is very attractive, the rooms are clean, and the doormen are fabulous. Other than these things the hotel doesn't really have much going for it other than it is moderately priced by New York standards.\\nMy husband and I stayed at the hotel mainly for the location and because I am an SPG member with an advanced standing and Starwoods is currently running a triple points promotion. I booked a junior suite and requested a high floor, a park view, a quiet room, and a member level upgrade. Generally Starwood hotels guarantee an automatic upgrade and try to accommodate members' requests. Not here. We received a room in the same category as booked on a middle floor with no view right next to the ice machine and elevator. The hotel was not at all booked to capacity so there must have been some other reason for the room allocation.\\nThe main decor of the rooms was down at heel Ikea (meaning wood veneer over particle board) which is not holding up well. The color scheme was primarily tan, brown and burnt orange. The green couch was hard and angular without accent pillows to make it more comfortable. The desk area was spacious. The platform bed had a futon mattress only and was hard and very uncomfortable. There was a small closet in the living room and a larger one in the bedroom both with curtains instead of doors. There was a built-in armoire in the bedroom as well.\\nThere is construction work going on next door and the hotel, especially the lobby, becomes quite noisy beginning in the early morning but that's no fault of the hotel's. The drain in the bathroom sink did not drain properly and this was eventually corrected, but when it was, the tub no longer drained.\\nWould we stay there again? I'm not sure; it would depend upon what else was available. The location and price were good but I don't think I could spend another night in one of their beds. I ended up sleeping on the couch instead. Just got back from my first New York trip and loved every minute of it. We had a room on the 28th floor overlooking 56th street and the construction noise did not bother us at all but the noise in the lobby and bar was extremely loud on most occasions that I was passing through and I commend the staff for being cheerful and polite while working under those conditions.\\nThe location was perfect, two subway stations nearby and walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, and Rockefeller Centre etc. as well as many places nearby to dine.\\nWe were two women sharing a twin room and space was not an issue at all though to be honest we were generally only in the room to sleep which we did very well as the beds were really comfortable which was a huge bonus after being out and about for 12 hours some days.\\nThe views from the pool area are spectacular but unfortunately the three times we went up there hoping to go outside to take photos we were told the deck was closed and we weren’t allowed out.\\nOverall the Hotel was perfectly adequate for our needs of a comfortable place to sleep, have a shower and drop off the shopping in between experiencing the most of New York that we could. I lucked out and got Le Parker Meridien through Priceline for two nights...so i actually didn't know the specific hotel until i purchased it ...needless to say the price of this upscale midtown manhattan hotel was really more than reasonable and i was very happy with the way things turned out....The room was just fine...maybe a little smaller than those in less congested areas but -- come on -- have you ever been to hotels in Europe or Japan (talk about small rooms !)... There was construction going in a building adjacent to the lobby so it was very noisy there...and i was a little concerned... but 35 floors has a remarkable effect on dampening out any such noises.... it was quiet as could be...not even street noise....\\nNeedless to say the hotel is in a wonderful location...a gazzilion restaurants around...(but don't forget to check out either the Carnegie or Stage Delis nearby for overwhelmingly large and delicious sandwiches, desserts, etc...put your diet on hold !)....The bathroom was clean and perhaps renovations had been done recently but i found everything just fine (large flat screen tv's ,etc....). Kinda wished that they had a coffee maker in the room -- but no such luck..... The maid service was excellent ... and the view from 35 stories up was lovely.... I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for two nights this fall. The room was cramped - which is normal for NYC, so I guess I cant blame them for that, but the bathroom was a bit tired - needed a new grout job in the tub, the shower head was terrible, shooting in all directions and no pressure - same story with the sink taps - literally no hot water pressure.\\nAlso, considering the hype and price of Le Parker Meridien, the room was a bit '2003'... the TV was still a huge tube tv, and the decor was just slightly out of date.\\nHowever, the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.\\nOh, and dont forget your toothpaste - the hotel was more than happy to bring up some toothpaste, but with a $10 charge to my room.... no thanks... \\nR We moved from the Hilton Times Square to the Meridien on 56/57 with its superior location near the park and good dinning spots. We had a junior suite which gave us extra room and the rate was less than the prior nights. Our stay was on a weekend so we did not experience the construction noise others have mentioned despite the fact we were on the 7th floor. My only complaint was I had made a reservation for breakfast at Norma's but when we arrive at the appointed time it was clear we would have a long wait. We elected not to wait as their are a number of good breakfast places with two blocks of the hotel. I can't say I like the room decor but I do like the location and having the extra sitting area was a real plus. Stayed for three nights in September on buisness, great location a few blocks from \"everything\".\\nBig rooms from an NYC hotel, good service, a great litle starbucks across the road for a coffee fix Here's the skinny: Stay here for access to a great gym onsite (Gravity), best breakfast and decent lap pool. Stay away if you want A/C in the off season (I hate hot rooms), restaurant for dinner (they have a burger place), and a bathroom big enough for two.\\nAs a Starwood Gold member, they give you an upgrade. My first visit last month yielded me a junior suite, very nice with plenty of space and stall shower. On this visit they gave me a park view room that was tiny, smoke filled and hot. The MOD informed me they shut down the cooling after the season and upon request, they could have a window opened. Really? The bathtub was wedged into the bathroom like a cruise ship's standard room. Ouch!\\nBreakfast at Norma's is an experience. Fresh everything, they make oversized everything and charge accordingly. French press coffee is served for $8 and worth it. Pancakes are the star and you won't eat them all. Downside: Expect to pay $50 p/p.\\nGravity is attached to the hotel in the basement but privately owned. Every free weight you can want, yoga room, plenty of treadmills, and full locker room (sauna). Worth the $10 day pass and opens at 5:30am.\\nVery nice intimate bar with great snacks and small glasses of wine and martinis. $22 for a house cab is high even for NY standards. \\nIf burgers aren't your thing, great Italian across the street and Nobu is a block away.\\nCould be the perfect hotel only if. . .good for business without spouses or kids. Andrew at front desk was super friendly and helpful. I arrived early but was accommodated with ease.\\nI requested extra towels during my stay and they were brought within 5 minutes.\\nBeautiful hotel with a great location, and very friendly, efficient staff.\\nWould stay again! Loved our one night stay at the Le Parker Meridien (using cash n points), was upgraded to a park view room (https://www.starwoodhotels.com/preferredguest/property/photos/index.html?propertyID=1909#photo_section_2Link) with a central park view (gold SPG) which was just beautiful in every way (shower could have been a bit nicer but bathroom as a whole was nice, and the tv was just a CRT flatscreen Sony Wega - not an LCD). beautiful pool on roof. \\nDidn't like that wifi wasn't automatically free in the lobby (had to keep asking for new 1/2 hour passwords and then getting a no). would have cost just $15 to get unlimited internet, but i'm cheap and most hotels will give you free wifi in the lobby at least. Also, lobby is great but could use a bit more seating (maybe not needed, since wifi isn't free). Other than that, the place was what we expected from a high class hotel (great bed etc). My wife and I recently stayed at the Le Parker Meridien for the first time. What an experience. The staff is wonderful! The room was gorgeous! The view..oh my god what a view of Central Park. I've been use to staying at hotels in the past in Times Square and not wanting to look out the window because the scenery was blah.. This hotel's view of Central Park is just amazing..and the price of the room no more then the Times Square hotels. I would highly recommend if you are looking to stay in Manhattan bypass Times Square and head to this hotel...you will not go wrong.. Oh I almost forgot the rooftop pool is another WOW! and the burger joint on the first floor is amazing. We had booked for three families to stay in November 2011. One of the three had a baby. \\nConfusion in deciding which room was for the family with the baby landed us with a a mini suite. This was amazing. On top of that, we had a very good service from the staff whenever we needed it. Just a quick business trip (1 day), but the staff was friendly and helpful and the location great. Room was spacious with a good desk and comfortable bed and sitting area. Would definitely stay again. Stayed there on a recent weekend. Got a good price on the room, especially by New York standards.\\nRoom was clean, good-sized and relatively modern although the TV could use some updating. Bed was very large and comfortable and bedding was quite nice. Room had a very useful desk in front of the window with an actual Aeron chair which was a nice touch. The bathroom was decent-sized, had plenty of good quality towels and nice shampoo, conditioner, etc. Only small negative was that the tub had been remodeled using a \"bath fitter\" type insert so the floor was a bit springy (yes I'm being picky).\\nLocation is excellent, adjacent Carnegie Hall, one block from Central Park, a ten minute walk to Times Square and a block from two subway lines. Our room on the 20th floor had a partial view of the park.\\nLobby was OK, but nothing special, but the lobby bar is definitely worth a visit. A couple good beers on tap (Leffe for one) and everything came with a cocktail mix of warm nuts and very yummy deep fried olives. I didn't make it to the \"Burger Joint\", but in the lobby, behind a curtain is literally a burger joint with $8 burgers. Where else are you going to find that in NY?\\nVery good experience and would visit again. Building work on one side - we were in room 821 and got a rude awaking @ 7.30ish on Monday morning by the site - not sure how the staff cope, the lobby was even noisier. Got moved to 3208 nice view of park, I think the staff were expecting a complaint - but a smaller room. But Hotel v central, and they do have burgers on site - not that there is any shortage of food any where close Nice hotel\\nExcellent breakfast\\nOld rooms\\nLack of proper closet annoying Just back from 4 wonderful days in NYC! The location of the Le Parker is perfect. You are out of the hustle/craziness of Times Square etc, but still in walking distance. Close to Central Park, shopping. theater district and restuarants.\\nWe found it interesting that this hotel is rated 4-5 stars. We have stayed at many Starwood properties including the Meridien in Barcelona and Bora Bora. We are Gold Members. This hotel is not a 5 star by any means. It is \"comfortable\" not over the top chi chi like a St Regis or other 4-5 star Starwood properties.\\nBeware of the construction, this is mentioned and in several other reviews. Starts promptly at 7a, Don't know how the hotel staff deals with this for 8-10 hours a day. It will \"jar\" from your sleep!\\nThe burger joint is worth a try, order from your room, pick it up, much faster than standing in line. Good burger, not the best ever. In a city like NY, where hotels abound and so should outstanding customer service, this hotel did the job, but that was about it. The mix of somewhat modern lobby, rooms in between contemporary and dated, as well as lounge/ bar area, made for a confusing mix of impressions. That is not to say the staff was not friendly, nor that the breakfast at the hotel restaurant was not outstanding. Overall, a mixed bag, but would opt for another location, if character is what you're looking for. In planning a 5-day romantic New York get away for my girlfriend's birthday, I didn't think I could do much better than a high-floor room with an expansive view of Central Park. The location was perfect for museums and shops, and the view was all I was hoping for. We were also excited that the hotel's associated gym had squash courts, and we brought our rackets.\\nUnfortunately, on our first morning (a Saturday) we were awakened by relatively constant jack-hammer noise from a construction site next door. Considering our high-floor, it was surprisingly loud. Since we’re from California, we would already be inclined to sleep late, and on vacation, sleeping in seemed even more valuable. Of course, the construction was completely out of the hotel's control, but we decided to move to somewhere quieter.\\nSince we had used points, the hotel said they couldn't really do anything for us, but urged us to call Starwood. After 30 minutes on the phone, they managed to move us to the W on Lexington. The downside was that we lost our \"fifth night free\" discount, and had to pay for the final night – an unexpected expense. So, we had the hassle of moving, plus the added cost of the room.\\nAll-in-all, not a great experience, but I'd certainly consider trying the hotel again after the construction is complete. The view really was beautiful. Nice hotel on excellent location just one block from Central Park\\nIf you like burgers: Burger Joint is hidden behind the curtain in the atrium lobby and if you'r a guest you don't have to wait in line( which is extremely long)\\nStarbucks just across the street From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, all personnel, especially the people at the front desk and concierge desk were friendly and so helpful. Our room was clean and a great place to sleep. Highly recommend a stay here. Part of the Starwood Properties - the Parker is wonderfully located for midtown meetings and Broadway as well as dining. Right now (October, 2011) someone else is building a hotel next door so ask about construction noise before you make a reservation (it starts at 7:00 am). I always stay here on my frequent trips to NY. I stayed at the Market Meridien 4 nights during the September 11th weekend, at the time there was construction right next to the hotel. Even so, we could not hear a peep from our room, so that was great. The location is the most remarkable thing about this hotel, excellent. I used to stay in the Time Square hotels but this is much better. The room was a semi-suite room, quite comfortable, but you could tell it needed a refresh - not bad though. Main gripe was the A/C unit was leaking the whole time were there and no-one came to fix it, the carpet was socking wet.\\nTip - There is a fantastic little restaurant on the corner call Rue 57, we had lunch there and liked it very much. I order the lamb mini burners and it was amazingly good! I am always on the look-out for a good business hotel in NYC. I decided to try this hotel based on TA reviews and the location. The hotel faces 56th St though there is also an entrance on 57th street. The reception seems always crowded with people at most times of the day. The check-in was smooth but I remembered to ask for a room NOT facing the construction outside the hotel and was lucky to get one. I probably would not be giving this hotel a good review if I had a room facing the construction site. So take note.\\nService was average. The concierge seemed disinterested when I asked for a running map of Central Park; the bell hops spent most of their time chatting inside. But rooms were nice and modern looking although on closer inspection you realize the TV is still CRT. Bathrooms were decent. Small closet space only though. Hardly any view from the room. But the room was quiet and I didnt hear traffic noise which is important and the noise from other rooms was minimal. The location is also great for shopping, Central Park, and food outlets. There is a good coffee bar in the hotel though they only have pastries to go with the coffee. But there is a Dean & Deluca right across the street, where you can pick up meals, coffee etc. Starbucks too. There is a subway close by and I walked to 7th ave to get cabs when I needed to. Would recommend this hotel for business.. This hotel is literally WALKING distance from Times Square, Theater District, Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Nobu 57, etc. You are paying for this amazing location. We were in town for the marathon and the staff suprisingly did not seem overwhelmed. I read a couple brilliant tips from tripadvisor before we arrived: ask for a room location far from the construction (call in advance); rent a mini-fridge ($40 for our entire stay); eat at Norma's and the Burger Joint (both excellent). Our room was silent, we heard no construction until we were in the lobby. The staff was amazingly friendly (front desk, maids). The decor is modern but we liked it - especially the revolving armoire in the middle of the room. The carpet was my only complaint about the room. Dark and hard to tell if it was clean or dirty. Toiletries are excellent (Peter Thomas Roth). The minibar has very steep prices (literally $5 for a can of coke) but we rented a minifridge on the first day and walked to the drugstore around the corner and stocked up with H2O, beer, gatorade, etc. Also of note - only a block from Nobu 57 - one of the best restaurants in the city. We will definitely return here! Le Parker Meridien has the most comfortable mattresses anywhere! We've stayed here 3 different times and the futon type mattress in the rooms have all been the BEST. It is worth the price to stay on the floors 26 and above, especially on the park side. Easy access from 56th or 57th street. Not far from subways. Great location - 2 short blocks from Central Park and Columbus Circle, easy walk to Rockefeller Center and Times Square. Staff is courteous and efficient. Hotels toiletries have the best fragrance! Superior King room is a little small, but the junior suite is roomy and very comfortable. Don't miss the view from the Pool Roof Deck - take your camera and walk around the outside to take pictures - spectacular view of the city as well as the park. This has been one of my favorite places to stay in NY for years. The location is great and the staff are wonderful. The rooms are a nice size by NY standards. Great gym as well. The breakfast place in the lobby is fabulous as is the burger joint - best in the city. The beds are comfortable and rooms are very clean and quiet.\\nMinuses: The Espresso bar/cocktail lounge is dark, dated and depressing. All the common areas need new lighting and a fresh, new look. The TVs are old fashioned flat screen tube TVs from the 90s. Wonderful location, rooms and STAFF! We have made the Parker Meridien our \"home\" in New York for the last 5 years and never plan to make a change! The hotel is in a great location two blocks south of the centre of Central Park. There is a Starbucks across the street from the front entrance, but you will need to venture farther afield (several blocks) to find breakfast/brunch on a Sunday (the wait at the hotel’s restaurant was over two hours). The Burger Joint in the hotel’s lobby is a good choice for burgers, but make sure you have enough people in your group to send someone off to grab a table as soon as it becomes available.\\nCheck-in for us was fast and straightforward, and we were allowed to check in at around noon on a holiday weekend. The staff was quite pleasant and personable. We found them to be quite accommodating throughout our stay, and when we requested something, it was handled quickly and professionally.\\nThe two sets of elevators meant a stop-over on the way to the 42nd-floor swimming pool. There appeared to be a charge for guests to use the fitness centre.\\nWe had a Deluxe room that would have seemed spacious in the Prairies and felt downright palatial in Manhattan. My partner and I had divergent views of the décor. I liked the Mad Men 1960’s feel of the room (with built-in furniture and a small bar) that seemed glamourous in comparison to the Westins we normally frequent. Though the room was spotless and everything was in excellent repair, my partner found it dated (though admitting the service and location were better than the Westin Times Square). The swivelling television stand was cool and useful for watching in bed or in the sitting area, but it is probably time to get rid of the CRT television in favour of flat-panels. The room was very quiet during our stay, and the bathroom was clean and modern (though I would have preferred a shower door to the curtain). Our view was of buildings, as one would expect in New York (though the park view from the pool level was quite nice).\\nOne thing I particularly liked about this hotel is that everything was branded and felt expensive/high-quality/tailored. From towels to shot-glasses to gel-ink pens, everything was marked Parker Méridien, and the normal hotel stuff (do not disturb sign, keycards, etc) were more whimsical than you would expect based on the marble-and-columns lobby. The hotel has gone out of its way to differentiate itself from major chains (though still Starwood). Interestingly (given the abundance of generic hotels in New York), we have since noticed this hotel’s interior (hallways and rooms) used in both Law and Order and The Good Wife.\\nThanks to the excellent service, good location, and generous room size, this is my new favourite hotel in Midtown. For this price-point, this is THE hotel to stay at in Manhattan. It is located near subway lines that allow you to easily get around. It is a short walk to Time Square, but far enough away to avoid the crowds. Unlike Time Square hotels, the staff at the Parker care how you are treated and want your repeat business. They were always polite and accommodating. They even provided a fan to help block out city noise at night. Things like that make a huge difference to me, and that is what sets them apart. The Parker Meridien has the most helpful staff who can give the scoop on nearby treasures and how to get there. It is also close to the theater district as well as 5th avenue high fashion to 8th avenue restaurant bargains. I wish our stay was longer. Safe and convienent mid-town location. Good restaurants, shopping, and the park all in easy walking distance. Rooms clean, staff helpful The lobby is inviting, and the staff members are friendly and helpful. I never had to wait in line, and, without asking for it, I was given a free upgrade to a very spacious, well-decorated room with a comfortable bed and a decent view. I assume that's because I'm a Starwood Rewards member, but the nearby Sheraton has never done that for me. The only source of disappointment about my room was the outdated, four-by-three, standard-definition TV. I've come to expect HDTV in nice hotels. By far, the biggest negative was the insanely loud pounding noise from a nearby construction site, which started Monday morning around 7am and went on almost non-stop until I left around 10:30am. But of course, that's not the hotel's fault. I definitely plan to stay at Le Parker Meridien the next time I'm in New York. Hopefully, by then, the noisy construction will have been completed, and the TV's will have been upgraded. One final note: I love the hole-in-the-wall burger joint off the lobby. What a quirky, fun feature. I kind of feel like I'm in on a secret, and the burger was fantastic. Great location, 5 minute walk from time's square and 5th avenue, surrounded by nice restaurant, 2 minute walk from subway. Really nice gym, overpriced and Internet is shotty and extremely overpriced. Business center is not free either. My husband and I took a weekend off (sans kids) to spend in NYC. We loved the Parker Meridien and hope to come back. The rooms were spacious (we had a junior suite), the beds comfy and the staff very attentive. The location was extraordinary. We walked most everywhere. . . . and brunch at Normas was fantastic. There was some construction next door, but we only realized on Monday morning as we were leaving since apparently they did not work over the weekend. The hotel room was kind of small and not very fancy but the staff was friendly, the room was clean, the price was great, and the location is fantastic. I really enjoyed my stay there. Just spent 2 nights at the hotel and was just as good as it was 3years ago. They have the best gym and I'm particular. Also getting a late check out was no problem. Staff was top notch and the helped for what ever I needed. I travel a lot and always stay at 4 to 5 star hotels and this was as good as I could hope for. I will be using the hotel again in May. Great stay. Clean Room. Nice and new furniture. Very Confortable bed. Very Luxury hotel in the heart of Manhattan. For sure I will return and recommend to my friends. The draw for this hotel is the restaurants and location, Norma's is a NY staple, the crunchy french toast is amazing, and the burger joint is a fun NYC experience. The focus of this trip was fun in central park so this hotel is a great location for spending time in central park yet close to times square and other sites. The room was cold as only the A/C was working, I am assuming that the heat for the hotel had not been switched on yet for winter so they brought up a space heater. Had a junior suite with a decent view of 56th street and ample space for a NYC hotel. Staff was attentive, but some things took a bit of time to get delivered. Overall a good stay and would stay there again, my favorite property in NYC remains the Chatwal. We have just returned from 6 nights, the staff were very helpful and efficient, our one complaint about a slow emptying sink was dealt with in minutes. The location was excellent for us and the swimming pool was very welcome. We would have preferred a more modest breakfast experience, we only had one and then went out. We would also have preferred a better choice of restaurant but again went out and found several good ones nearby. The room was extremely comfortable and quiet and we slept very soundly. The atmosphere is very business orientated but overall it was a good stay. This is the fourth time I have spent the weekend at Le Parker Meridien and each time, I think it gets better!!! The location is the main reason: walking distance to Central Park, Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue, Frick, etc. I only took a taxi ride twice during our stay. The rooms at the hotel are really nice: beds are perfect, amenities are sufficient, and the rooms quiet and clean. The staff at the Parker are intelligent, helpful and courteous. Can't wait to stay again, and I will!! Le Parker Meridien is a great place to stay while visiting New York. It is centrally located closed to major locations. Their service is A+ and the staff makes you feel welcomed right from checking in time! We will go back there again! I was happy to find a room with reasonable price at a very busy season in June 2011 (eight out of ten hotels were full). The hotel was close to Central Park, and not far from Time Square. My wife and I were thrill to see the contemporary designed Junior suite. Even with the sofa bed for my daughter opened, the room was spacious and comfortable. The staffs at the front desk and concierge were extremely helpful. The staff at the house keeping was efficient and friendly in providing us with an electric kettle within minutes. We were happy with the three days stay in New York City. \\nIf I might give some suggestions, I would say the computer at the front desk to be upgraded to be faster, the wired internet connection at my room to be free and to be connected continuously the whole day (no need for me to answer questions on the front page each time), and the bathroom being provided with double vanity tops and mirrors. Stayed for one night with my husband. The last review was very accurate. Nothing wrong with this hotel, good svc., clean etc. But I would not recommend it for a romantic getaway. It had more of a business vibe. The decor in the halls were very dark and dismal and the room was bland and minimalistic in decor. Very dorm room-esk. Can't speak for all the rooms as we had a standard/superior. No amenities in the room (just a tiny shampoo and conditioner and bar soap. So look at it as a nice place to sleep in a really good location. Nothing more, nothing less. If you are looking for a boutique type hotel with atmosphere and those little extra's, this is not the place. I stood here using my points so I am glad I did not have to pay the sticker price. We have stayed at more upscale, pricier hotels on special occasions and you do get what you pay for as far as atmosphere and amenities. But remember its NY and as my husband says about most of the hotels, \" they are all glorified apartment buildings with a marquis out front\" lol. This is the second time I stayed at Le Parker Meridien and since nothing has changed over the last year I decided to write a review this time. To start I want to say that there is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is clean, staff are polite and the location is in a good spot between Central Park and Midtown/Times Sq - but lots of hotels can say this in NYC!\\nI used points for this hotel as I was not keen on paying what I consider to be well above what they should be charged for the services provided. No coffee or teas in the room, the TV unit takes up much more room than it should and the TV is old and barely watchable. \\nAdditionally, you have to pay to use the downstairs gym - $10 and internet (again a Starwood addiction of making everyone but platinum member pay, even though I am Gold) is $16.20.\\nThe shower was great, bed comfortable and 2 restaurants popular and know across the city. Again not a bad choice, but nothing too exciting. Desk team and Valet superior, check in fast and friendly--- bar/food very good---concierge team (at least on this night) was lackluster with no urgency to serve.... Televisions are old (big and take up too much space) but good size screens--- no coffee in room, a personal rant--- I hate to pay for internet, so I used my hotspot-- at $600 guys - throw in the internet! Bed was awesome, amenities very nice... Would stay again Stayed here for 5 days/4 nights. We paid a premium for the hotel rate because there was a UN meeting going on and I don't know what else which made the traffic unbearable. I discovered use of the subway toward the end of my trip and that was much more efficient and cost effective. The subway entrance is right at the end of the street so it's super convenient. The service at the hotel was okay. I don't know if the heating/AC system was working properly in my room b/c there seemed to be constant cold air coming out of the vents even though I had cranked up the temperature, so I was always a little chilly in the room. And the hotel does not provide bathrobes, nor the usual toiletries such as cotton balls, qtips, razors, toothpaste, etc. I consider that to be extremely stingy considering I'm paying $500+ a night! How much can a razor cost the hotel? Maybe a dollar at most? I travel frequently and have never come across a hotel that does not provide these items upon request. \\nAlso the swimming pool is pretty small. It is difficult to find a time when the pool is not full of 2 or 3 people swimming laps already. And the pool can really only fit 2 people swimming laps comfortably. There is no jacuzzi at all. \\nOverall, I would not stay here again. I feel like you get very little for your money here. The Parker is one of my favorite hotels in Manhattan. I love the location of the hotel (just south of Central Park) and close to shopping on 5th avenue, Rockefeller plaza, Times Square, nearby subway stops. The service at this hotel is always great and I like the modern feel of the hotel. It's also got great restaurants - Norma's (good brunch) and the hidden burger joint. The one downside is the hotel is starting to look a little worn and dated (tube TV's in most rooms). Other than that, I would totally recommend as great mid-town hotel. I've been to Le Parker Merdiain in NYC twice the in past three months and have always loved my stay. It's not complete without a nightcap at Nave and breakfast at Norma's. Next time I'll try te Burger oin which everyone says is out of this world, too! I can see where this hotel was pretty \"hip\", \"cool\" and especially \"schticky\" in the 90s with its shot glasses in the bathroom (instead of normal water glasses)... casual \"hey, I'm funny and witty\" type language, etc. Seems a bit dated now but it's not all that important in your overall stay anyway!\\nIt was a little annoying that our room wasn't ready at 5pm when we checked in but the worst part of the stay was when the woman at check-in referred to my husband as my son. Yes, my son. Yes, he looks quite young (lucky!) but we're the same age and I know for sure that we don't look THAT far apart in age. Maaaaaybe 5 years? The woman had an accent so perhaps it was a language barrier? Highly doubt it but it was quite rude.\\nOther than that... we stayed on Starwood Points and got a great room on the 15th floor. Quiet... clean... comfortable... good size. Great location. Would stay again. Oh, and we remembered when we stayed here last time (a few years ago) that the breakfast at Norma's is quite expensive. Save your pennies and go to Starbucks across the street. My husband and I stayed at the Le Parker Meridien in Manhattan for the first time to celebrate a birthday and loved every moment. We found our room to be very nice and only a few blocks away from Radio City and Central Park. I like the convenience of having a gym, pool and two wonderful places to enjoy a meal so close by. Looking forward to another stay in the near future. I am a starwood member so I try to only stay at starwood properties when I can. Between the W's, Sheraton's, and this hotel, I will definitely continue staying at the Meridien. Rooms are basic, comfy bed, nice bathrooms. When I stayed I was upgraded to a junior suite which was nice and big, the best part for sure was the massive bathroom. Some parts of the hotel could use an upgrade, but overall it is nice. I have not had a bed bug incident here on any of my multiple stays, and given the issues NYC has, that is a thumbs up for this property. My wife and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien over the Victoria Day (Canada) long weekend in May. It was my 4th time in NYC in the last 3 years and it was definitely my favourite hotel (better than the Hilton, Park Hyatt, Marriott, etc.). I was obviously a little worried about the bed bug situation in NYC but the cleanliness of the hotel alleviated my concerns. \\nOverall, the hotel was great - large rooms for an NYC hotel with contemporary decor. The concierge was more than helpful in providing directions and suggestions for food. The subway was very convenient - two lines within a 5 minute walk. Museums and shopping are close as well.\\nI didn't eat at the hotel but have heard good things about the brunch and the burgers there.\\nI would certainly recommend choosing the hotel. room was very large by NY standards. Clean, beautiful linens, comfortable bed, and wonderful staff. This hotel uis conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan. I stayed here a few years ago and felt the staff were rude, but when I stayed here this month, they were very warm and welcoming, so I would now highly recommend this hotel. The one thing I wish could be improved is that there are long waits for the high-rise elevators. Otehrwise evrything was great. Was pleasantly surprised by my first time stay at Le Parker Meridien. We moved form another hotel where our stay was not as pleasant. At Le Parker Meridien, staff were tremendously friendly and helpful, terrific location, comfortable and well appointed rooms. If you eat at Norma's in the lobby, take your appetite or share a plate as the portions are HUGE - the food was terrific as well. We would go back to Le Parker Meridien without hesitation. Nice hotel (wonderful lobby) with a convenient location. Concierge staff was rude and not helpfull at all. Overall management should invest more on people and service, less on hardware. Nice vidas, quiet room, excelent locación and service We loved our room - a beautiful room with a spectacular Central Park view!! Thanks to Emilie in customer service and all the staff..our stay for my wife's birthday and our anniversary was awesome! We walked from the hotel to Times Sqaure and 2 shows, Rockefeller Center, and Central Park! We took the subway to the WTC site and a cab to Lincoln Center (we could have walked but would have been difficult in high heels for my wife!). I stayed here on business last year and this was an excellent hotel. The beds were comfortable, rooms were nicely decorated and clean. Most importantly, the rooms were quite – we were originally staying at another hotel in New York that had a disco on roof that turned out to be a nightmare and coming to this hotel was a relief after that. \\nI had ordered internet service for my room and it did not work properly – but when I checked out I was reimbursed for this, so they did the right thing. If I were to come to New York, I would most likely stay here again. Do not waste your time for this New York hotel if you are used to nice Starwood properties. We stayed and were very disappointed with everything - from service to rooms (junior suite).\\nIf you are platinum (which I am) in the starwood system (also Platinum in Marriott system), you will be disappointed!! I've stayed all over the world in fantastic hotels and this is not one of them. Maybe I'm just spoiled - but one gets used to certain standards and being treated like a special guest. \\nI am not going to get into all the details, but as things continued to go wrong, management did not accommodate, even after personally walking down to the front desk.\\nMy advice - stay away!! Got the W Union Square instead - this place is a W wannabe, be far from it! I stayed here on points\\nThe location was great - but we did a lot of walking in Manhattan and we walked past a lot of hotels, whether this hotel is better value than the others I can't say as we didn't actually pay for it.\\nCompared to the other SPG hotels - I'd say the location is probably comparable to all of them, none are far from the subway, all have their pros and cons.\\nI can say that the interior of this hotel is new.\\nThe exterior front is undergoing construction - as is a lot of other stuff in the area.\\nThe lobby is tiny - though with all the mirrors you can't really notice. \\nThere is a gym - we didn't use it, it looked ok and you have to pay $10 i think to use it.\\nThere is a pool on the 42 floor - whether you swim or not you should go up - you can see central park from here.\\nIf you room is below the 22nd floor you will have no view. We were on 8th and saw some buildings and a construction site.\\nThe elevators are split L-22 and 22-42. You switch at 22 unless you are going to the lobby, if you face north on 22 you might see central park, anything below you are likely below all adjacent buildings.\\nThere is internet - $16.28 a day, you might have to go to guess services to get a cable\\nThere is wireless too, though i didn't try it.\\nThere is a mini bar - no fridge, it explicitly states that the mini bar is electronic and if you want a fridge you have to rent one.\\nThere is no water, coffee etc.\\nThere is a starbucks directly across the street (and up the street and around the corner...) \\nI didn't try any of the cafes or restaurants in the hotel or in the vicinity of the hotel\\nAll in all, i think this hotel was fine. The room was small, but I have nothing else to compare to in new york.\\nI think they were changing the beds to sheraton sweet sleeper, i didn't have a problem with my bed but my husband noted it wasn't standard spg issue.\\nIf you are paying and expecting a view then either get a guarantee that you will get a view or you will likely be disappointed.\\nThis hotel was also very quiet - for us anyway - likely the fact that we were in an area with offices helped this as there didn't seem to be much noise. I booked a room for my father as part of a weekend 75th birthday party. The hotel staff did a great job providing us a room with a great view. The staff were friendly and responsive. My father loved his stay. Most everything was top notch but the building is rather old. Accordingly, we didn't have the ability to control our room's air conditioning (the entire hotel is kept at a fixed temp... we were told to open the windows if we got warm) and the sound deadening between rooms was lacking. We had a connecting room, which could have made this issue seem worse than it actually is. But overall, I found these to be acceptable issues given the price and location. My wife and I are New York natives but checked in for two nights to celebrate our Anniversary. In the week leading up to our stay, I think I called the hotel at least once a day trying to arrange plans/get suggestion for area restaurants and was greeted with super-friendly service every time.\\nI arranged for my wife to check in a few hours before I was able to arrive and also coordinated an in-room massage for her before my arrival. Everything went off without a hitch. \\nSince it was our Anniversary (I noted that in my reservation) we were upgraded to a Park view room. It was really amazing to wake up to that view during the days we spent there.\\nAdditionally I got some recommendations for restaurants nearby we'd never heard of before and both turned to be excellent!\\nAs someone who travels several times a year I always appreciate when I feel that the hotel staff goes above and beyond for their guests, and this hotel does so with a rare exuberance for New York This hotel is perfectly placed a block south of central park, with a pool on the rooftop, and a great burger joint in the lobby. It's my go-to place when travelling to NYC. Good gym and restaurant as well. \\nThere are a few minor annoyances - no tea or coffee in the room, no bottled water included, no internet included, and the room service food sometimes seems not on par with what you'd expect. \\nStaff are always helpful and punctual however, and I've changed rooms easily on occasion. Very good, pleasant clean hotel in excellent midtown location. Beds are excellent. huge rooms for a midtown manhattan hotel. Comfy bed, nice amenities, friendly staff. Good value for the money, too, and you can't beat the location. Much larger room than I expected, very quiet. Easy to get everywhere I wanted to go: park, theatre, museums. Staff was courteous and helpful. Cute touch with classic cartoons playing in the elevators. Especially accessible if coming in from west side, One-way street travels east, pull up to hotel leave your car and you're free. As everyone's already said, mid town attractions within walking distance. Park view rooms are lovely. Travellers who are not used to the city will be very comfortable here, as there are helpful staff and great service.\\nRestauarants are known for their delicious food--plenty of patrons who aren't hotel guests. After Carnegie Hall esp convenient. If you don't feel like a big meal but are not vegetarian, walk down the little hall near reception desk, behind curtain, and find yourself at Burger Joint. Sudden transformation from formal lobby to ultra informal burgers and fries. Extremely tasty, quick, efficient even if there's a long line. Plus menus in many languages. Night we went the staff were friendly, great sense of humor even though faced with a hungry crowd. Ordering system spelled out for you! Food comes in brown paper bags you can eat there in a booth or take out. \\nAlso, room was not cramped as some NYC rooms are. WATER PRESSURE WAS GREAT in the shower. Modern decor. They seem to have fallen in love with orange in a big way, but it's more of an accent color than a dominant one. People complaining about rooms needing an update were perhaps booking on discount sites? I booked on hotel web site and had very clean new room with great view. Although there was staging up for some work being done, there was no noise or other hassle. Also! Very quiet in halls and room. Bath products very cool. Amazing style, friendliness, cleanliness and convenience near Central Park. Every expressed need is met by hotel staff. We spend two nights here for a weekend trip to the Big Apple. And we had a blast! The staff were very friendly and helpful, we were upgraded to a Park View room which had a lovely view of Central Park. The location is perfect for shopping, close to 5th Ave and also the MoMa and other sights are at walkable distance. If I have to name anything negative it has to be the charge of $16 for internet on top of the room rate. And if you decide to have breakfast at Norma's (in the lobby) be prepared to wait (long) and spend more then average on a (fantastic) breakfast. Great hotel in a perfect location. Rooms were spacious for a NY hotel, well appointed. Staff were extremely helpful. Housekeeping was amazing. Anything we asked for was sent right up to our room within minutes. I've stayed at a lot of other mid-town hotels, but I always come back to the Parker. From the in house dining to the beautiful rooms with great views it just can't be beat. We stayed here for our 5th anniversary. It was great - very nice staff, fun restaurants downstairs and easy cab / walking distance to so many attractions. I loved the Le Parker Meridien - friendly staff, well appointed rooms, beautifully decorated but c'mon - $329/nt? Really? It's NYC, but there has to be some limits. I also had a great bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup and a wonderful Grilled Cheese for $53 from room service. Yikes...\\nThis is a great property that does everything right, but I really struggle spending big bucks for a place to sleep and a late night repast (I arrived after 11:00pm). \\nI'd stay here again - but only if someone else was paying. Le Parker Meridien is a great hotel from several aspects: \\n1) Location - can't beat it for midtown. Convenient to everything.\\n2) Service - service was friendly and helpful. My key got demagnetized and the front desk immediately sent someone up to help me instead of me having to go back downstairs\\n3) Overall - the rooms were nice. I would even say a little larger than the typical NYC hotel room. Bath products were very nice as well.\\nMy only complaint is that the elevators were ridiculously slow. I think maybe only one elevator was running for the entire tower side of the building but this problem persisted for both days I was there. This just made you have to leave a little earlier than you would normally but overall not too big of a deal.\\nI would definitely recommend Le Parker Meridien to anyone wanting to stay in midtown. New York hotels generally suck. Tiny rooms for the price, way too much comotion and noise coming from outside and inside the hotel. Le Parker Meridien is different, It's an oasis. I look forward to a few minutes away from the chaos. I've stayed at this hotel before and return because of the great location and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend it but do wish their restaurant wasn't quite so fancy/expensive. This hotel has a great location, the rooms were comfortable, and the service was good. If you are looking for a hotel with a great bar and a restaurant that serves alcohol this is not the place to stay. But if you want a quiet hotel this is the place to stay. The bad: Not much, just long waits for elevator. \\nThe good: friendly, helpful staff, excellent physical facilities, great location, great view (when we told the front desk it was our 25th wedding anniversary, she upgraded us to a Central Park view room). Norma's had a great breakfast although be prepared to pay for it. The location was close to Lincoln Center, 5th and Madison Ave shopping, Central Park and the theater district but was out of the crowds of Time Square. We parked on 56th and 8th Avenue, about two blocks away, for $38 per day and could have paid less if we had parked a few more blocks west. We will definitely return. I stay in Midtown at least yearly for business and have tried multiple hotels: have found one I want to come back too and that is memorable!\\nFirst the critiques: the rooms (and I believe we had the most basic type) are not amazing. That said, while understated, they are convenient and very comfortable: great beds, easy temperature control, good bathroom, good closet and convenient desk space. \\nThe elevators are temperamental: they sometimes close a little fast. The internet fee is very costly.\\nNow for compliments: service is good. This was particularly evident at the swimming pool where attendants were helpful, polite, child friendly. Talking about the pool: nice space, and unbeatable view. Location: outstanding, closer to Central Park then Time Square but really not far from both. A few steps from landmarks like Carnegie Hall and The Russian Tea Room. Talking about food: some of the best NYC food is at the hotel! Norma's breakfast is truly a metaphysical experience. The Burger Joint has a cult following for good reasons. Finally the gym, though not free, is truly the best spanning multiple levels and rooms: will pay for access to a fabulous gym rather than a few crummy machines.\\nFinally, this hotel is slightly more upscale and slightly more expensive than many of the usual midtown business hotels, but online advance rates were decent/competitive. Great location, wonderful rooms, fabulous service. I really love this hotel and stay here frequently when in New York City. Can't beat the location. Love the Burger Joint and there are so many great places to eat nearby. The high quality sheets make for a good night's rest and the service is top rate. All in all for the $, this mis my top choice in the Big Apple. Consistently outstanding! Our holiday was booked thro Expedia to this hotel. When we arrived only rooms avail were with Kingsize beds, no twin beds with park view which was what we had booked. Would not upgrade us but told us may be avail next day, we were too tired to argue so took these. Next day a mess was left on our room phone to say 2 rooms were avail with park views if we wanted to swop over but we were happy where we were and didn't want to waste any more time repacking suitcases. This hotel is a great find in the area, Fabulous shopping is a block away! \\nMy only complaint is paying for the internet in the room when it's free in the lobby. It should be free period! Great staff ... great location ... what a wonderful weekend. We'll be back. Stayed here for 5 nights using Starwood points. Now keep in mind that I am Platinum with SPG so my review might be a bit skewed so I will not point out any special treatment I received due to my status.\\nI traveled with my wife and 2 year old daughter. We were in a Jr Suite on the 25th floor with a city view. The view from that side of the hotel was nothing special but from the pool area was pretty spectacular. Staff upon check in was superb. Bags were delivered to my room promptly and check in was super fast. Housekeeping was wonderful as well.\\n2 things that separate this property from the other 2 dozen or so I've stayed at in NYC. It is quiet. I don't know if it's because I was 25 floors above the street but I was not disturbed by street noise as I usually am at other hotels. Also there wasn't any sort of party crowd at this property so the lobby and hallways were relatively quiet at all times of day and night. Finally, in the room there were no weird noises coming from any broken AC or elevators or whatever makes noises throughout the night in most of the older hotels in the city. It was nothing but peace and quiet.\\nLocation was perfect. 2 blocks to Central Park, 5th Ave shopping, all restaurants you could ever want, etc. We even walked to Times Square a couple of times and that only took about 15 minutes. It is also on a relatively quiet street so not a huge sense of urgency and panic getting in/out of taxis.\\nI will definitely stay here again - especially when I am on vacation with my family. I have stayed in countless hotels, from 5-star to dumpy $100/night places. And I've never had to call housekeeping or the frontdesk as often as I did at the Meridien. We were promised turndown service and then it never showed up. Not a big deal except the fact that my kids (who were supposed to be sleeping on pullout in our suite) had no blankets or pillows. We ha just returned from dinner and they were exhausted but couldn't go to bed. I called and called and no one showed up w/ pillows and blankets for an hour.\\nThis poor service actually started when we checked in - there was a disorganized rush of people. The frontdesk was ill prepared to handle it and unable to organize it. And the poor service continued into the final day when we left for the pool and returned to our room only to find that housekeeping had taken all of our towels and not replaced them.\\nI gave them a bad review on a survey they sent me post trip. That resulted in a hollow promise from someone in corporate that assured me my service would be better \"next time.\" I doubt there will be a next time. This is the only hotel I stay out when in NY. Checking in is always a breeze, the rooms are large for NY, contemporary and well appointed. Having the Burger Joint (NY best burgers) as well as Norma's (NY's best Lemony Pancakes/cream) on site is ideal. It makes it feel like home. . . but with valet and housekeeping services 24/7. Great midtown location, Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, 5th Ave, etc. all within walking distance. I stayed room that faces central park and that was great.\\nAmenities and design of the rooms are classy and functional. Stayed 2 nights at this hotel. The location was superb, everthing was in reach, I walked to Times Square, Rockefeller center, etc. Subway F line very close, and columbus circle with mulitple trains was also very close, just a couple of blocks. I got there very early expecting to just check my luggage with the concierge and check in later, but the desk person was able to get me checked into a room anyway, even though it was well before check in time. Some scaffolding outside the building, but who cares? It's like that all over the place in New York. Awesome beautiful Starwood hotel in a great, near Central Park location. all the touristy stuff- Times Square, The Park, MoMA, 5th Avenue shopping are all right there. But subways to Chelsea, and Village are also right there as well. So get out of midtown and into the real NYC.\\nAlso- The Burger Joint. Best burger in NYC, possibly the country. you will not be sorry.\\nDon't miss Norma's either. Although- split a dish- The food is huge, but s are the prices. Split an entree and get an app. The Service team from the Front Desk for Cleaning Room, passing for Room services and restaurants are very sharp, polite but precise and expend a lot attention for the customer. I think it is the best and friendly service I have experienced in New York.\\nThis location bring you the Central Park so close, nice brands around for shopping, close to Theater District but without collaterals (crowded) and of course very nice restaurants at walk distance. very good stay at the hotel even alone. Great location, close to central park and 5th avenue. Nice centrally located hotel, handy to sub way and main midtown shopping areas and Carnegie Hall and Times Square theatres. \\nQuiet haven in the hustle and bustle of NYC.\\nBreakfast in Norma's restaurant was nice - they have a good range of \"Healthy choices\"\\nRoom was spacious enough and housekeeping did a great job. Mini Bar wasn't working and they offered to move me to another room.\\nMeeting facilities are a little limited - guess that's an issue of NYC real estate being so expensive\\nStaff were friendly and helpful I have enjoyed several stays at Le Parker Meridien. The staff always find me a quiet room away from the elevator, this time away from the street and with a park view. The location near Carnegie Hall and just a few blocks from Lincoln Center is perfect for business and pleasure. But at this price, I would expect a newspaper, free internet and coffee service in the room. The best thing about this hotel is its location, hands down. It is located in between the theater district and Central Park. Both are only a few blocks away. The hotel itself is average. Our room was clean, though the furniture was rather cheap. The bed was somewhat uncomfortable, and the pillows were not very supportive. The bathroom was clean, and the faucets produced hot water quickly. There are no vending machines in the hotel and apparently no convienence store in the lobby, so if you want a drink in your room, your options are to order room service, to use the minibar in the room, or to go outside and find a store. The staff members were friendly. With all that being said, this is not a bad hotel; it's just average. You would be ok staying here, but if you want a hotel that is on the nicer end of the scale, this hotel might not be the one for you. My stay at the Parker Meridien was great. Room with a fabulous view of the park, fun and tasty Norma's Restaurant in the hotel, and amazing service upon check in. Really a great experience! I have only good things to say about Le Parker Meridien. It's a beautiful hotel, clean, nicely appointed, spacious rooms. For a treat, ask for a room with a Central Park view. I even slept well, which is a rarity for me. The room was quiet and the bed very comfortable. We enjoyed drinks at the Knave, the hotel bar, a richly decorated gem with friendly waitstaff and top-notch, hand-crafted cocktails. At first the lack of an in-hotel restaurant, other than the famous burger joint, seems like a flaw, but, you are in mid-town Manhattan, with no shortage of fine places to dine within walking distance. Angelo's Pizza across the street is not to be missed! Don't miss Norma's inside the hotel for breakfast at least once (Huevos Ranchos is very yummy!), but after that, there are plenty of options just out the door. Great location, amazing view of Central Park, but room was small and TV was not very good. Also found dirt/lint on the chair. Treated like I was a second class customer since I did not flash wads of money.\\nThe burger joint off the lobby is a nice touch and was good, but the food does not live up to the hype. Free internet in the bar in the back of the lobby.\\nI would stay here again, but I'd look around first. rooms very nice, clean and modern.\\nservice excellent and kind\\ni can only say positive thinghs Excellent decor and service. Staff demeanor and competence are outstanding. Terrific access to theatre district, museums, restaurants, shopping and Central Park. Don't miss Norma's for Sunday Brunch; bountiful and tasty portions. We have returned to this hotel at least annually for the past six years. We just spent a wonderful treat-yourself weekend at Le Parker Meridien in New York City, and it really was a treat. The hotel decor is elegant--formal marble and columns in the lobby and light wood modern in the rooms, both beautifully done. The location is excellent--around the block from Carnegie Hall, a short walk to Lincoln Center, two blocks to the south end of Central Park, and short walks to subways. The hotel also features a roof-top enclosed heated pool--generous size for a hotel pool-- and a well- equipped gym. There's a highly rated burger joint with top-quality burgers tucked into a corner of the lobby-usually with a long line, which shows how good--and tiny--the place is. Norma's restaurant, also in the lobby, serves a spectacular breakfast, and the small Knave--basically a reconfigured hallway between the main lobby and the north entry--is a comfy espresso, drink, and snack bar. All service staff were on best behavior at all times, not too busy to be friendly--rare in New York and making for a delightful stay. Not a cheap weekend, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. we were going to stay at a hotel that was more money and not nearly as nice, but got lucky with an email from le parker merdien with a sale!!\\nwe stayed at lpm for a lower price then the 2 star hotel we were going to originally book. This was our first stay at a Parker Meridien and we were not disappointed. The room was very spacious (a surprise for NYC) and beautifully furnished. The view of the city was excellent. The concierge was very helpful, giving us excellent tips for dining with a toddler. We were able to walk to Times Square, 5th Avenue, and Central Park very easily and safely. Pricy, but great hotel. Good location, short distance to shops, restaurants, Metro, shows etc. Great service from the concierge reception. Very nice fitness center. Stayed at the hotel for 9 nights in a junior suite. Ask for the family fun package if travelling with children. Wireless internet not included, it should have been. The location is wonderful and you we loved swimming at the 42nd floor looking back to the fifth avenue..... We travel to NYC about 6 times a year and this place is the best...excellent location with it's proximity to Central Park, Time Square & 5th Ave, clean, spacious rooms, good food/bar, rooftop pool, BUT the best reason is the awesome STAFF. From the second you walk in, everyone is professional & goes above and beyond to make your stay pleasant. Honorable Mention to Lisa Tharp in Guest Relations...she could have not been more accomadating this past stay after a small \"snafu\" when we were guests in January. Nothing to complain about here... lovely hotel, lovely staff, very comfortable! Great Midtown location for theater and opera, plus...shopping. Strong staff with more personality than many large hotels. Our room was modern and comfortable with a great bed and fine bedding. The late-night bar is a great place to end your day in New York.\\nWe got a promotional rate at the hotel's site that made this a bargain, besides. It's fair to say we got off to a bad start as when booking we requested interconnecting rooms but upon arrival we were offered rooms that were not even adjacent..which was never going to work with 2 young children. Whilst I understand that interconnecting rooms are never guaranteed, what was frustrating was the denial from the Hotel that the request had been submitted by our travel agent (I double checked and it had). We were offered a diplomatic suite for the first 2 days and inerconnecting for our final 3 nights. The suite was a lovely size although not ideal as there were no separate beds for our 2 kids, rather a sofa bed for them to share..so in the end our eldest slept on cushions on the floor. The \"park view\" interconnecting rooms didn't materialize on day 3 (varying reasons depending on who you spoke to), so we ended up with 10F \"construction site\" view rooms. After being woken at 4am by the noise, from the works opposite the hotel, we were finally moved on day 4 to the rooms we had originally booked. So 3 rooms and the subsequent packing and unpacking for a 5 night stay, hardly ideal. The housekeeping staff were also under severe pressure, our last room wasn't available until after 7pm..unacceptable.\\nSo other than the room debacle, good and bad points.\\nThe room was pretty warm, no problem I thought, I'll just turn down the aircon temperature..wrong! We were told that the whole hotel is on \"heat\" at the moment, so the coolest setting is \"off\". How can a 21st century, 5 star hotel not have independently controlled rooms?\\nScaffolding outside, not mentioned when booking and also the previously mentioned work opposite. I think the rooms are starting to look dated, eg CRT TVs..no flatscreens and a stereo player (in the suite) possibly from the late 80s/early 90s. \\nNo directory of hotel services in our first room, they're being updated apparently, although they were present in our later rooms. I thought the front desk staff were doing an admirable job, clearly a lot of guests had issues and the hotel was extremely busy over the Easter period. I thought the pool on the top floor was a welcome addition and one of the main reasons we booked the hotel. \\nExcellent location for Central Park and Midtown.\\nThe burger bar was a nightmare to get into and overrated, I think the hotel misses a quality restaurant (need to book for breakfast!) and also a larger and more prominent bar. \\nHow can you justify $18 for wireless internet connection, when I've paid $450 per night for each room ?\\nOverall, considering the room rates, I expected better and will certainly be trying elsewhere on my next visit to NYC. Norma's (need reservation) is super breakfast/lunch spot. Lobby bar has great ambience. Rooms comfortable. Shower has best flow of any hotel I have been, true luxury. Location is pretty ideal for business and touring. Great room in a perfect location with a staff to match. Unfortunately, this is a hotel that has lost its glamour. The doormen and concierge act more like thugs then hotel staff. Not very helpful, especially upon arrival. If you're a New Yorker, maybe ok, but if you have travelled, expect less than first class. Really enjoyed this hotel and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was outstanding.\\nQuality of the breakfast was also great with excellent service.\\nWe were a little disappointed in the burger bar. It had such great reviews regarding the quality of the food but once we looked around the curtain and saw how dark and crowded it was we didn't bother and went elsewhere.\\nBed was very comfy but sleep was interupted by subway trains (not really the hotel's fault!, this is New York after all) and some other noisy guests with children running up and down the corridor. Again, hardly the fault of the hotel. \\nExcellent location. Would certainly stay here again. Every staff person that I encountered at the hotel was competent AND helpful. Special kudos to the Front Desk lady who helped me with the address of a restaurant and to the Concierge who arranged for a rental car for me. And then there is NORMA'S! Bacon heaven! I also enjoyed the Knave in the mornings for coffee and a pastry; it is a lovely use of the space. Speaking of space, my guest room was huge by New York standards. Simple in design with lots of closet space; helpful when traveling for several days. There was also a great shower in the bathroom. I lived in Manhattan for six years before relocating to Florida. I return about 3 times per year, and I now almost exclusively stay here! The funny thing is I work for a competing mega-hotel-chain and can get pretty decent rates, but I still choose to use my Starwood points to stay here each time! \\nThe rooms are comfortable and modern, yet very spacious if you can get a Jr. Suite. As others have said, the location is excellent as well. The staff is 100% professional and top-notch. The burger joint is a must-do and the bar, while pricey, is a fun place to hang out for a bit. Just a wonderful place to hang your hat for a few days while in the city!\\nThe only downsides are the many incidental charges: the expensive internet connection at $16/day, but I have a 4G smarthphone with wi-fi so that's solved. The gym I hear is nice, but I refuse to pay $10 to access the gym for 30 minutes of cardio! That's unacceptable in my opinion. \\nFinally, my advice is to hit one of the corner stores in the area and stock up on water, snacks, etc. My favorite is Klein Ernest which is on 6th Ave between 55th and 56th St. There is also a liquor store on 58th between 6th and 7th Ave which is pretty good. I thought Le Parker Meridien was a great and convenient hotel. Loved the hamburger \"joint\" hidden in the lobby. Wonderful experience. Recently stayed at Le Parker Meridien for the second time and it continues to be my favorite hotel in NYC. The rooftop pool is a wonderful amenity and the lobby coffee bar is wonderful - great atmosphere & staff. It is a wonderful place to relax and unwind after a fun-filled day - great coffee & martinis!! There is a top-notch spa and fitness center as well. The curtain hidden Burger Joint still has the world's best burger - If you didn;t know about it you woyuldn't even knoiw it was there but world of mouth has taken care of that!! Get there early or be prepared to wait in line (opens at 11:00 a.m. - lines start at 12:30 p.m.)- it's worth it!! Other than one gentleman who works at the front desk and has an air of superiority (both times we stayed there) the staff is courteous, friendly and efficient. Breakfast is way overpriced but there are plenty of choices in the area outside the hotel. The restuarant next door to the hotel is under renovations as is the outdoor rooftop deck, but that didn't effect my stay - the pool are is indoors and a wonderful spot to relax with amaziong 360 degree view of the city. The views of Central Park from this hotel are spectacular. I would definitley request a high floor with a park view. Thoroughly enjoyed our two-night stay. Terrific location, very comfortable, clean and upscale rooms. And the elevators were so much fun to ride in!\\n Very accommodating to our requests and needs. When we first arrived, we asked for a quieter room on a higher floor, which was immediately changed. There was a problem with one of the amenities (clock radio); within minutes of requesting a replacement, it was done. When we went out in the evening, we were offered additional umbrellas without even asking! When we checked out, we even had our luggage safely stored for the afternoon and evening until we could come back and pick them up.\\nWould definitely stay at Le Parker Meridien should the opportunity arise. I have always wanted to stay here and finally had the chance to. We were given an upgrade and had an amazing view of Central Park. \\nI want to mention Anastasia at the front desk. She was great and gave excellent service. She even wished us a Happy Anniversary ;-)\\nWe ate at the Burger Joint- burgers were great. Just note that this place is very popular so it was crowded but defintely worth waiting for a seat. The burger bar was fabulous if a little expensive.\\nThe room was a standard 4* with ample space and storage. I felt like they really wanted me to be there, almost like I was a star or something. I did not know that kind of attitude still existed in the industry. Love, love, love me some Le Parker Meridien. Love the orange and gray, love the modern vibe, love the location, even love the dang shampoo.\\nIts a must see and a MUST STAY! This was my third stay at LPM and as always we had a great time. If I could change anything I would not book with bargain basement rates with online travel agency ... nothing wrong with them, but having stayed this time on the cheap rather than my previous stays when I booked directly with LPM reservations, I much prefered being able to negotiate a room on the 26th floor with a park view than being given a room on the 11th with a view and sounds of a building site ... you get what you pay for! Having said that, the room was great, really comfy beds and clean bathroom. We had a problem with our loo on arrival with was dealt with super quick and accompanied by a personal apology from head of housekeeping. Special mention must go to the two gentlemen of the concierge who were unfailingly helpful and as a result of their suggestion we had the best steak meal ever! I minor niggle that I can't quite get past (but has not put me off returning!) is that getting a breakfast can be a bit stressful at the weekends, as for some reason I've never quite understood, LPM open their restaurant, Norma's, to every Tom, Dick and Harry that want to eat there, as a result LPM guests have to book well ahead for weekend breakfast and as we found, you may find you have to get up early to ring down for a cancellation. I still find it a bit bizarre to expect paying guests to eat outside the hotel while non residents fill up the breakfast tables and not something I've come across in any other hotel, but having said that the breakfast are worth the stress and we did manage to get tables when we wanted. All in all I would definitely recommend a stay here as Hotel location is just about as good as it gets, the rooms are great, the staff are courteous and nothing is too much trouble. The Knave bar was particuarly good for a late night hot chocolate. Oh and how could I forget the amazing burgers from the burger joint tucked away in the corner of reception, a hidden treat! Well done LPM and thank you! The Parker Merdian is a fantastic mid-town location. Rooms are a bit minimalistic, but in an extremely fashionable / chic manner. Staff is always extremely helpful. Views of Central Park from the high floors are great. My daughter and I stayed here while in the city visiting colleges. Centrally located, we were close to the theatre district, trains, shopping and Central Park. The concierge helped us with reservations for an incredible dinner at a restaurant I never would have discovered otherwise and cabs were at the ready. Our room was exceptionally clean and quiet. Would absolutely stay here again. We have been staying at Le Parker Meridien for years. It is our go to hotel everytime we are in the city. We stay there as a couple and as a family with our 5 year old son. The Junior Suite is the best set up. You have a bed AND a pull out couch for your little one. There is enogh space for a family to breath in the Junior Suite witch is not easy to come by in the city that never sleeps. The staff is accommodating which helps when you are ordering room service for a young child who may not like what is on the menu. The rooms are clean and always kept up to date. Something is new and refreshed each time we visit. It's great because The Buger Joint is in the lobby for a quick bite to eat. It happens to be one of the best burger places in the entire city! The location is amazing. Close to the theater, great restaurants, Central Park, and Times Square, not to mention the best shopping! If you are heading downtown, they will hail you a cab, no worries. It is always easy and a pleasure staying at Le Parker Meridien Hotel in NY. Ideal location, just around the corner from Carnegie Hall & The Russian Tea Room, just steps away from the subway and few blocks from Central Park.\\nA Starbucks Coffee Shop and Dean & DeLuca across the street.\\nUnder some construction, but very considerate not to begin too early or too late.\\nWe were happy to upgrade to a Junior Suite, kids had plenty of room and loved the swivel TV! Large, modern bathroom and plenty of closet space.\\nThe King size bed, mattress was fantastic and we had the best sleep ever!\\nNice to wake up to a fresh terry robe too!\\nWould book back in a New York Minute!!!! great restaurants in the hotel, great location,the hotel bar was great.make sure you make reservations at norma's restaurant in the hotel so you do not have to wait along time for your table,but it is worth the wait.I am a starwood member and i think because i was upgraded to a mini suite, it was great! Location is great - steps to subway, Dean and Deluca cafe and Starbucks across the street, a couple of blocks to Central Park, short walk to Times Square. Got a great deal on Hotwire, facilities are also good - room was a good size for Manhattan, excellent gym (although disappointing to pay $10 per visit), pool area really nice, internet connection is $16/day, so went to Starbucks for free wifi instead. Staff are overall quite nice - we arrived on a Friday at noon and since there was a room available, we were able to check in right away. Didn't try the restos, though they are talked about very positively. Overall very happy with experience and stay here. While on business in NYC I usually stay at another brand. However, I found this hotel to be quite exquisite and centrally located. Le Parker Meridien is down the road from Carnegie Hall, a couple of blocks from Central Park and very close to the subway. The lobby is impersonal and set round minimalist reception desks. There is a breakfast bar on one side and a very popular burger bar on the other side. Opening into 57th street is a long narrow bar which serves from breakfast till late, with efficient and friendly staff. There is a gym downstairs and a small swimming pool on the top floor with great views uptown. The rooms are a good size, well styled with lots of hanging space, a safe, desk, chairs and a large swivelling TV, dvd and games consol. The bed was large and comfortable. The bathrooms are reasonable size with a bath, shower, fluffy towels, a good hairdryer and an excellent makeup mirror. There is a minimal supply of toiletries - a box of tissues and one each of shampoo, conditioner and two thin soaps. Having no dressing gowns or slippers with a pool upstairs was a shame. They also have an excellent facility in the lobby to check in on line and print your boarding pass for free. Overall therefore a good value stay with friendly and helpful staff. Location is great, room is clean and tidy. Pity that they didnt offer me a suite with park view. Down side is they don't have lounge for platinum members, which means no free breakfast~~~Overrall, it's much better than other hotels in NYC, such as Westin Time Square (small and noisy...) We have just returned from a 10 day stay at Le Parker Meridien. We had originally booked a basic suite but took advantage of a suite upgrade for a small cost at check in. Our suite was spacious with a fantastic view of Central Park. The hotel is perfectly located for our family, being an easy walk to all our NYC favourites- Central Park, theatre district, Moma and 5th Avenue etc. Staff were helpful and attentive at all times. This hotel is now our NYC favourite. I took my Daughters to NYC for Spring Break and we chose Le Parker Meridien for it's location to everything within walking distance of what we wanted. The oversize twin beds are interesting but 2 children fit into them comfortably. There was construction going on during our visit so when we pulled up to the Hotel there was scaffolding out front and I do wish I would have known this or had been told when I bookd the hotel......The construction wasn't bad but it was hard to appreciate how nice the hotel inside is/was with this ugly scaffolding right out front. However, our stay was lovely and the customer service at this hotel was great!!! I would go back if I know Darius is still working there. Loved everything about it. Perfect midtown location with lots of conveniences just outside the hotel. However, never wanted to leave between the Gravity gym, room service, and cozy room. Spa set-up could benefit from upgrade/expansion and pool area is rather plain, otherwise the hotel has everything one could want. Nothing outstanding, although no red-flags either. I stayed for 3 nights for business meetings. Location is good. Check-in was efficient. Rooms are clean & everything was in working order - which is absolutely critical. Some of the furnishings seemed \"cheap\" - like bed frame, curtain for closet - although not a big deal to me. Fewer amenities than many hotels (i.e. includes shampoo, conditioner, lotion, large safe & umbrella- which was helpful --- does not have coffee maker, robe, body wash or Qtips/cotton balls). I didn't think noise was too bad. Like that able to print airline boarding pass for free in lobby. Didn't like that hotel food & internet were very expensive - although that is consistent with other properties I've stayed at in New York. Bottom line - location is good, I haven't rated a reasonably priced New York hotel above a 3 - so compared to other comparably priced NYC hotels, this is an ok choice. I spent one night at the Parker Meridien while in NYC with my husband for a concert at Lincoln Center. The location was great - close not only to Lincoln Center but also Carnegie Hall, Central Park and Broadway. The rooms were large enough, beds very comfortable and nice Peter Thomas Roth products in the bathroom. There wasn't a coffee maker in the room, but there's a Starbucks directly across the street! Staff was very pleasant and I'd definitely stay there again. If you can afford it, I highly, highly recommend the Le Parker Meridien. In NYC, you have to be really careful, because most of the hotels are old, and as such have mold, leaky faucets, suspect carpets, horrible beds, etc. The Le Parker Meridien is completely updated, wonderfully clean, and in a terrific location to local restaurants, subway lines, Central Park, the major museums, etc. My daughter and I had a simply lovely time. great location near columbus circle; small but cozy rooms with beautiful decor. beds are a little soft but not bad. Beautiful hotel overlooking Central Park. Loved it. Great location. We had a king suite and it was very spacious. I did not eat in the restaurant but my friend had and said it was great. Would love to stay there again. I was put up here by a NYC organization that invited me to an event they were holding in the neighborhood. As my usual business travel to New York focuses on Midtown East, staying here was a chance to experience the other side of midtown Manhattan as a visitor. It's a nice area and very convenient to Central Park, Columbus Circle and subway lines that can take you quicklly and cheaply up/downtown.\\nI liked the vibe and comfort of the hotel, yet a couple of standard in-room amenities for this quality property were missing--no in-room coffeemaker and no bathrobe.\\nThe fitness club was better than average, but I had to pay $10/day to use it, even as a paying guest! Not a competitive point. We were planning to have our 16 year old daughter stay with a friend so we wouldn't have to pay for a suite for our family of four. Instead, a wonderful hostess at the front desk offered us their diplomatic suite for $200 more per night during a sold out week, what would normally go for $1500/night. Wow, what a view, what a bargain, a really nice reward for loyal guests. We'll definitely be back. I travel a lot on business and am used to being treated well. This was perfect for my husband and myself. Very nice lobby to chill out. Not noisy like a lot of W's (which I also stay) Beautiful lounge to have coffee or drink before or after show or after shopping. Excellent gym which we used on a rainy day. Norma's was expensive but worth it and it was wonderful after you digested the price that you were paying for breakfast.\\nI would choose this hotel again particularly for a weekend. I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 3 nights. I got an excellent rate for the room using Priceline. If I had paid full price for the room that I was assigned, I would have been disappointed, but since I got a deal through Priceline, I overlooked the minor asthetic problems with the room. \\nThe room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable, and the sheets were clean and crisp. The towels and wash clothes were clean, and seemed to be new. There was a large safe with a programmable combination in the closet. The furniture was in near perfect condition--no visable scratches or marks. \\nThe bathroom was large, and featured a large vanity. The faucet was so close to the back of the sink that it made it impossible to wash your hands without getting water all over the vanity. The toilet was also very low to the ground, so if you have issues getting up and down from a seated position, you may want to request a handicapped room. \\nAt some point, they must have been a leak in the room, as there were several spots on the ceiling in the bathroom and the bedroom that were painted a different shade of white. The paint on the doors was also chipped. \\nThe room was not very soundproof. The street noise was very loud (particularly the night when dumpsters at the building across the street were emptied at 2:00 a.m. the morning). I've stayed at about 20 hotels in NYC, and I've never noticed the street noise the way I did at Le Parker Meridien. While I expect some street noise when I stay in the city, I have never had it wake me up in the middle of the night like it did at Le Parker Meridien. \\nThe doors of the rooms also seemed a bit loud when they closed. I heard my neighbors doors each night when they arrived back to their room at night. \\nThe staff was pleasant and helpful. They were efficient at check-in and check-out, and the housekeeper on my floor was friendly and quick with a smile. \\nI tried the Burger Joint, and was not impressed. While the burger was good, it wasn't worth a long wait to get it (I went at an off time, and only waited about 15 minutes). The fries were not very good--the tasted like they had sat out for a while. There is not enough seating. By the time you order your burger, fries, and a drink, the price is close to what you'd pay for a meal at a place like Applebees or Chili's. \\nOverall, I enjoyed my stay. Most of the issues that I noticed with the room were very minor, and could easily be fixed with some paint. I would definitely stay here again. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It is in an excellent location within walking distance of most things you would want to see or do in NYC. Room was lovely and clean although sofa bed was a bit uncomfortable for my teenage daughter. Could not fault the staff who were professional, welcoming and polite. My two young daughters and myself were often walking back and forward from the hotel to Times Square very late at night and always felt that we were in a safe neighbourhood. This is a lovely, clean and convenient place to stay in NYC. . My wife and I spent the night of April 2nd at the Meridien and it could not have gone any better. We checked in and I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and anything special they could do would be great. Lawrence at the front desk was extremely helpful and gave us a room on the 32nd floor overlooking the park. The room was nice and clean with a lot of room for NYC. I definitely felt like I was un a luxury hotel. Unfortunately we only spent less than 24 hours in the hotel and didn't get to experience much else but everyone we did deal with was extremely helpful and I look forward to returning the next time I am in the city. Worst hotel ever. I only give it one star because I don't know how to give it a lower ranking. In general the rooms were outdated and the staff was unhelpful. Specifically, our hotel room flooded and we believe the staff stole a ring from our room (which we promptly reported). Not only did the staff fail to fix these problems but the hotel staff didn't even apologize for our terrible experience, let alone try to make it right. This place was excellent, clean and friendly. would recommend it to anyone. As for the post about bed bugs, we did not see any bed bugs or signs of bed bugs so that is not true. great place to stay! I recently traveled to NYC on business with my husband. We ended up booking at Le Parker Meridien through Hotwire and got a great rate, however we weren't quite sure what to expect once we got there. My worries were over once we stepped foot into the lobby and up to the front desk for check-in. It was such a breeze! Checking in took no longer than 5 minutes, and the front desk agent was helpful and friendly. The room was immaculately clean and well kept, as were the public spaces in the hotel. Concierge and front desk staff were amazingly helpful! Not being from the area, whenever we had questions they really took their time to help us, whether it was with directions, or food/restaurant suggestions. And not only did they help us, but they were pleasant while doing so. I would absolutely stay here again. Stayed for three days. Room was clean and well appointed. Elevators efficient. All staff we encountered were very helpul and friendly, used front desk, conceriege, housekeeping, restaurant. Everyone helpful and very cool!\\nHotel is extremely well located! Few quick blocks to theatre district and 1 block from 5th avenue and 2 blocks from the park. Great location!\\nWill definately stay again! Le Parker Meridien is an excellent hotel! The facility is beautiful and the staff is friendly, professional, and dedicated. Very clean hotel with a great staff. Norma's is a very good hotel restaurant and you just can't beat the Burger Joint behind the velvet curtain. Wonderful room layout. Service was excellent. Would return in a heart-beat! From the moment I arrived I felt welcomed especially after the reception person thanked me for returning. Everything works in the rooms and they are ALWAYS clean. I really really love staying in this hotel. I highly recommend this hotel. The gym center, the roomy guest rooms, the wonderful view of the Central Park make the diference. Perfect Location. Clean Rooms. Upgrade to Park view room with SPG Gold status. Very low last minute rate on spg.com. Room Service Quick. Excellent TV. Fantastic front desk staff (huge bonus)\\nOnly downside were the archaic hairdryer (pack your own) and no bathrobe.\\nWill chose this hotel again. Was upgraded as a SPG Platinum from a reserved Tower King Park View to a Junior Suite in the Tower with a Park View. This Junior Suite was approximately 50% larger than the Junior Suites I've previously been upgraded to when I've reserved the least expensive room (NOT the Tower King Park View) at this property.\\nRoom and bath were spotless. Room was warm but opening the windows for 10 minutes solved this issue. High-speed internet was free as part of the SPG Platinum benefits. No problems with the internet.\\nEmilie at the front desk was wonderful. Makes you feel special.\\nRoom service was quick, though they did forget the drink I ordered. It arrived about five minutes later.\\nDid video check out and stopped at front desk and retrieved a copy of my folio. About two hours later, a copy of my folio was also emailed to me. Quick check in , check out, was quite impressed with the helpful front office staff and also the knowledgable concierge. \\nGood location ( close to my office).\\nSlow breakfast at Norma's and hence could not try it. Knave has a quick croissant and coffee/tea option for those in a rush. Could not try the recommended burger place due to the long queue, and went to Angelo's pizza restaurant located opposite the hotel, which was ok. Room service took half an hour for breakfast but they had told me in advance so it was fine.\\nThe room was quite small, but adequate for a single traveller. This was my second stay at the Le Parker Meridien and it was wonderful. The staff is very helpful and they always go above and beyond to meet your needs. We called and asked for an extra wash cloth one night because the maid had only left 1 and they brought us a stack of 5! They always take it to the next level with their service.\\nThe location si also wonderful. Very close to subway stations and also close to the park and entertainment. I would definetly stay here again! This hotel is an ideal location in midtown. The front desk staff is extremely helpful! I was very pleased and impressed with Reina and how informative she was when she checked us in. However, twice during our stay we were interrupted by other staff members in unusual ways. First, a man came to our door, rang the bell and asked us if we needed mini-bar service even though we hadn't touched anything in the mini-bar. Second, on the morning before we checked out around 8:00 a.m. (check out is at noon) a member of the housekeeping staff rang the bell and woke us. \\nOverall, it was a nice place and we are still sad we didn't have a chance to try to burger place that everyone raves about, but the line fills up fast and the hotel was packed the weekend we were there so there were long waits at both the restaurant and at the bell station so we opted to not check out luggage and catch an earlier train. There was also no ATM in the hotel and the burger place only takes cash, which again, is somewhat inconvenient. I got this room for $138 via Priceline Name Your Own Price which is an insanely low price for this hotel. With that said, who am I to complain, but.... The room was pretty small even by NY standards, and the tan paneling was not that appealing. The beds were rather low to the ground albeit pretty comfortable. The TV channel selection was basic cable. I mention this because if I had paid full price I would have been a little disappointed. The location of the hotel is great- right next to Central Park and Carnegie Hall, and only a few minute walk to Times Square /Theater District. The staff was pleasant and the common areas were clean and busting with people. \\nGiven what I paid for the room I was quite happy, but if I had paid full price, I would have been a little disappointed. I love hotels with style, but staying at one usually means I have to sacrifce business friendliness and location to stay at one (I'm referring to you, W Hotels New York). Le Parker is the total package. This visit, the service was top notch...not just for New York, but compared to anywhere in the US.\\nPros: SERVICE, Burger Joint, stylish comfortable rooms, classic cartoons in the elevators.\\nCons: Restaurant noisy for breakfast meetings, taxi waits can be long, Perfect location, fantastic view of Central Park and the bed / room was very comfortable.\\n Good burgers at the Burger Joint Restaurant. We had a great time at The Parker Meridien (got it by chance through Hotwire). It's perfectly located next to Central Park and far away enough from Broadway that you don't get the noise, yet close enough that you can walk quite quickly. It's in a beautiful part of the city. Like everywhere in NYC, parking is expensive, so we saved some money by taking a commuter train in. Room was pretty big for NYC standards, and clean. We were a bit disappointed that they charge for Wi-Fi. We had our breakfast in the lobby restaurant. Was not too busy, were seated promptly. Our meals arrived cold after a very long delay. Had to ask our waiter for our food.\\n After an evening around town we would have liked to visit the bar for a nightcap, but was told it closed at 12:45. Odd for a city such as ours. Very disappointing! Also the parking is not \"free\" as implied below. Another dated New York chain hotel, needing some refurbishment of rooms. Not one of Starwood's best.....\\nWhat I liked:\\n- convenient location if you have meetings in midtown\\n- norma's....great brunch there\\n- nice lobby, i guess.....\\nWhat could be better:\\n- rooms were old and cramped, even though I had apparently a better 'corner room'. Bed and table felt outdated and cramped\\n- toilet in my room continued to make strange sounds \\n- price asked was $300 plus, for what was a 3.5/4 star room at best\\n- you look straight into office buildings when you peer out the window\\n- the 'secret' burger joint in the lobby meant there were massive lines of tourists fililng up the lobby. In my view, the burgers were not that good and the people serving them have an attitude I was traveling with one friend for a weekend in the city. The hotel staff were extremely polite and knowledgeable about things to do in Manhattan. We arrived late Friday afternoon, and heard a large amount of noise in our room. Thankfully the hotel had included a letter about construction that was currently taking place M-F 11 AM - 6 PM, and it was stopped by 6 PM. Le Parker Meridien had a very contemporary, yet relaxed vibe, and the beds were FANTASTIC! One last thing -- there is a one hundred $$ charge placed onto your credit card to reserve for any damages (Taken off after you leave). Be mindful of that, they don't tell you! Great hotel. We really enjoyed our stay. Very clean and in a great location. This may be my favorite New York Hotel. I'm thrilled Le Parker Meridien is now part of the SPG family of hotels. Great location. Close to subway, Central Park, restaurants. Service is great. Close to Time square. All within walking distance. Would stay again. A good place . . .nice ambiance, good staff. Only issue was we booked two rooms together, and when we got there found they were on diff. floor (how is that \"together\"?) so I had to straighten that out.\\nAlso--no coffee makers in the rooms. Asked for one . . . was told there were none, but I'm sure I had one last time I stayed there. Starbucks is across the street but I need a cup of jo to even think about walking across the street! Title says it all really.\\nFriendly staff at check in although there was a bit of a problem with the booking (although don't think this was the hotel's fault). The room, on the 21st floor, had city views: not even a hint of the park sadly. Room decor was simple but a bit tired and the room was a decent size for New Yor. Room furniture looked pretty cheap though. Reminded of all the fake wood stuff from the 70s. It was a very simply furnished room, no luxury here for sure. The TV (old) was in some giant rotating metal thing. Completely pointless and ugly. Would have been better off mounted on the wall. Closet space was poor: an area in the room with a curtain over it. The bathroom was better and worked well. The bed was okay: they had put in an additional down mattress on top of the traditional one which I'm sure made it more comfortable if a bit lumpy in places. \\nNo free wifi in the room which was a bit disappointing but free in the bar. Bar was shockingly expensive and by day became an espresso bar which served very nice coffee. Shame it didn't open until 0730 am. \\nMorning noise was bad due to renovations on the roof. Drilling for hours.....apparently you couldn't escape it no matter where you were due to sound travelling through the building or something. Very irritating.\\nSo at $400 a night it was NOT good. Really not worth it. Very mediocre room which may be passble at half that amount but unless you get a really good deal, I wouldn't stay here again. Ever! I stayed at this hotel for 1 night with my teen-age son. \\nAs many have previously stated, the hotel location is very convenient and the rooms are clean. I also have no complaints about hotel staff. The lobby is nice.\\nHowever, my average size room for NYC seemed dated (i.e. popcorn ceiling, oldish furniture which appeared to be on the cheap side, older model TV.) The room appointments were nothing special.\\nThe mattresses were VERY hard and VERY uncomfortable. The 2 single beds were also too low to the floor for my liking.\\nThe view of an old office building from my 19th floor room wasn't great . If you can get a room with a park view I'm guessing it might be much better.\\nI had a great online rate for the room so I guess I shouldn't complain. But all-in-all it was only an okay experience. Just didn't seem like a 4 star hotel room to me. - more like 2.5 or 3. I love W Hotels and am a big starwood fan. Almost stayed at the W Union Sq. but selected this hotel based on reviews. The room was so small (even for NY) and many things didn't function properly from the air, tv, hair dryer. The bed was not very comfortable and I cannot remember staying in a hotel where the bed wasn't good. On the plus side, the view overlooking the park was awesome and the location is great. We had cocktails at the lobby bar which is a great place to meet people for a late night gathering whether you stay at the hotel or not. This hotel has an excellent location. Room was very good,. except for the bed (Rm 3812); it was comfortable, roomy and conductive to work and relax. The hotel has only one restaurant which operates mostly as a cafeteria. It could use a better restaurant (specially during winter), but there are plenty of good restaurants in the immediate neighborhood. Love the Burger Joint in the hotel; amazing. Also great breakfast/brunch restaurant (Norma's). This hotel is excellent in it's location to everything in Manhattan. The staff was very courteous and helpful with all of my requests. The only issue is the construction at Carnegie Hall which kicked in at 7:00 AM every morning. Everything else was WONDERFUL. The staff was wonderful. They helped make a special occasion incredibly memorable. Don't forget your bathingsuit! The enclosed rooftop pool and its views are a treat! First, the positiives. Great staff. Outstanding gym.\\nBut room location was a disgrace. I had a reservation for a junior suite. That wasn't avaialble, so all I asked for was a quiet room, and after a couple of very polite requests, I ended up with a room on a lower level, directly across from the elevator. Air conditioning didn't work. And I have preferred status with Starwood. as above. great hotel in a great location-midtown manhattan, near carnegie hall, broadway, lincoln center and near a, near a subway stop.clean, spacious, functional rooms, with many nice amenities in the hotel including great breakfast restaurant (open until midafternoon), an inexpensive, good hamburger restaurant, and a nice light breakfast restaurant/bar. My family and I enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Le Parker Meridien on 56th St in NYC this past weekend. The hotel is central to what we like to do in the Big Apple - Broadway Plays, Central Park, museums and great restaurants.\\nThe pool on the Penthouse floor offered great views of Central Park!. All the staff we came in contact with were pleasant, and helpful. \\nWe'll definitely be staying at the Le Parker Meridien again. I loved my stay in Le Parker Meridian and wish that I had been there longer than one night ! There is construction going on in the front which was a bit annoying at first and once inside, you forget it because the people are there for you and for you to be comfortable and taken care of. I had a room facing Central Park which was breath-taking. Bed was very comfortable - bathroom a bit plain for this type of hotel and all of it was well attended to so that you could feel at home. \\nThe bar is exquisite - a beautiful place to hang out and the Burger Joint is unique. I stayed at Le Parker Meridian because of a Priceline bid. So I did not really choose the hotel myself. But my stay was lovely. Check in was unremarkably easy and uncomplicated. The room was quiet and extremely clean. The bed was comfortable and there were extra pillows in the room in case I wanted them (I did!). \\n The Burger restaurant off the lobby was a very casual touch in this upscale hotel. It sort of seemed to not 'fit' with the atmosphere of the hotel, but I am so very glad it was there and open late the night I arrived. The only thing I would have dreaded more than going out to eat after traveling cross country woukld have been paying room service prices :) The small coffee bar was an AMAZING place to have a morning macchiato before my appointments. \\n The only negatives I can think of - the shower cap did not fit entirely over my shoulder length hair; and the 57th street entrance was not well marked. The location is excellent. I will look forward to staying again when the upgrades on the outside are finished as the scaffording on the outside was a little distracting. Of course, it can't be helped and did not affect the inside. This was my return to this favorite hotel after an defection for a very good french hotel six month ago and the experience was incredibly excellent, confirming the reasons why I love this hotel. The unique atmosphere starts at the lobby, Norma restaurant and the cafe Nave, besides the hard to match Burger Join behind the curtain. It follows with the sensation of being living at a luxury appartment in NYC with great service and very comfortable rooms. The Concierge tips on dinning were surpringly good, for some with experience in the city. Borrom line, great place with great service along unique style. We keep coming back- Rooms are quiet, whistle-clean, elegant/minimalist with enough walk-around-the-room space; always an interesting view and the park is gorgeous all year long. Right in the middle of it all: it's a five-minute walk to just about anything (and worth the extra steps to everything else). Helpful, polite staff to point out what the locals do, and where to find it. Norma's does the room service, what a treat after a late night out! LOVE the \"Lazy Sunday checkout\" option, the cherry on top of a weekend. Spent 8 days in NYC helping my son get his apartment set up. PM was the perfect launch pad. Coffee and croissants in Knave to start the day. Drinks in Knave to recover after all the moving/assembly. Short walk for shopping. Short walk to a show. Quick ride to MSG for a hockey game. Park close by. Best ever hamburgers in the dive in the lobby (take them to go and eat in your room, otherwise you'll wait hours for a table) We have stayed at the Le Parker Meridien before and each time was delightful. The staff is helpful and delightful. When dealing with them, you feel they are genuinely interested in you. They are professional, but there's a personal charm that they all seem to have. \\nThe room is always clean and if a robe is wanted, you just ask and it's delivered. Both of us use the gym which is large and well equipped, bring head phones unless you can zone out while jogging. Afterwards we tend to switch into swim gear and head to the enclosed roof top heated pool which is available all year round. It's relaxing and has a wonderful view.\\nFor those of you who like an unbelieveaable hamburger there's almost a hidden 'hamburger joint'. If you hate lines like I do, off hours like mid-afternoon really work well. It's a very relaxed crowd, but pajamas may be pushing it. You may need to ask at the front desk for it's location the first time.\\nIf you like to walk, jog or just commune in Central Park, it's maybe a two block walk. Or if you want to see Carnegie Hall or the Russian Tea Room, they're the same block. \\nWe typically go up to see a show and for us we take a ten minute walk and stand in line for discount tickets. It's a fun experience and I keep hearing I'm very lucky as the lines for me have been about ten miuntes and the discounts are 30-50%. \\nIf you're looking for the economy hotels, this isn't for you. If you are looking value, location, cleanliness and a friendly, helpful staff, it's a good place to stay. We had tickets for Lincoln Center and dinner reservations at Gordon Ramsay @ the London, Maze. The hotel was convenient to both. We were literally two blocks through easy covered \"cut through\" lobbies in public buildings to the restaurant. It was a $4.70 cab fare to Lincoln Center. \\nThe lobby of the hotel is sleek and modern. The room keys are ridiculously long cards. Some designer thought they were cool, I guess, but they didn't fit in a pants pocket or wallet. \\nThe room was done in an early 60's retro look. Brown and orange color scheme with lots of velvet. We were upgraded to a suite so we had very spacious accommodations. My husband did not like the \"old\" look - but I didn't mind it. I knew it wasn't really old. I knew it was sylistically a \"retro\" look.\\nThe hotel is an easy walk to Carneghie Deli and Carneghie Hall. We really enjoyed our stay. I would stay there again. Comfortable beds with good pillows. Nice big shower. The main complaints were no coffee pot or ironing board in the room. We love to make our first cup of coffee in the morning to have while we are getting ready. Beautiful hotel. Great beds and pillows. For the price of the room, they should provide tea or coffee and news paper in the room. I visited the hotel from Thursday 24th to Monday 28th of February and we had a fantastic time. Time square is 5-10 walk and the 5th Avenue round the corner.\\nThe room had great views to the park and the bed was so confortable.\\nWe went to the pool everyday to relax after long walks and it was nice and hot. Don't expect to do much of swiming as it is small, but great to spend time with kids. I think there is another pool on the Spa Area but there is a charge of $10 per day.\\nGreat Hamburger place at the hotel, full of locals and the Tai next door was fantanstic. \\nIn all we had a fantastic time and we will repeat the experience at the same hotel I've stayed at a lot of NY hotels over the years. But I always ask for the Parker. When they say \"Up town, Not Uptight.\" , that's me. We stayed on a Saturday night and the hotel was quite busy. Nevertheless, we were upgraded to a 30th floor park-view room without even asking, due to our Gold SPG status. We were impressed with the lack of noise. This is one of the best all-around hotels in New York, especially if traveling with children. Luxurious but modern hotel in close proximity to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, and subway lines. One of the few Manhattan hotels with an indoor pool. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Manhattan! We stayed at the Meriden again after trying the Elysee a few times. The location is about the best you can find - either walking or subway up or downtown. You have to think a little about were you are headed before you get a taxi - maybe better to walk to 6th or 7th Avenue as opposed to picking up the cab in front of the hotel. Also search for discount parking before you use their valet - at $50/day (or part thereof) its a ripoff. The staff is always very pleasant and accommodating. This time there were no bathrobes in the room and when we called they sent them right up. The inroom amenities are somewhat lacking for a hotel of this caliber particularly the no Wi-Fi or bottled water (things that the Elysee provided at no cost). But overall we like the Meriden better for its location and its more modern rooms (the Elysee with the in room air and heat is a bit much). We will return. \\nper Had a great, if cold time, in New York. Le Parker Meredien is in a great location, set back from Central Park by just 2 streets. Choose a room from the 22nd floor up to get a view of the Park itself - ours, on the 29th floor, was glorious. The room was contempoary, practical and perfectly comfortable and clean. Only points of contention was that there was only a desk (no table) and, all hot drinkers beware, no kettle and coffee! Although we got a good deal on our holiday through Expedia, it seemed a might penny-pinching to us. The room was adequate in size and traffic noise minimised by being so high up.\\nThe pool on the top floor was warm and again had lovely scenic views. However, it was always crowded with children when we went up and was actually quite small - too small to 'swim' properly really! Never visited the gym as you had to pay $10 to use it (shame!). And you had to pay too much to use the TV Internet.\\nThe only other problem was the mini-bar, whose fridge contained pressurised sections so the hotel could charge you as soon as an item was removed. Whilst they need to make a profit, I simply wanted to store a pint of milk in the fridge which I couldn't do, as the cost of the item I would remove far exceeded the cost of the milk (huge, huge, huge, ridiculous mini-bar prices were a source of great amusement). They immediately refunded the cost of my blithely removing 3 items, but told me I could hire another fridge for $40! Slightly mean again.\\nFood in New York is expensive, more than I had expected. Food generally in the hotel was too much to consider. We ate at a restaurant once, Landmarc at the Time Warner Centre, which was delicious and (comparatively) reasonably priced. Note that my burger was $16 excluding tax and tips etc. Very tasty, great atmosphere though.\\nNote also that there really is a lot of walking in New York. Everyone says it, but it's true. Everyone we asked for help (including strangers) were extremely courteous and an assistant in the J Crew store near the Financial District couldn't have been more enthusiastic and helpful in giving us a walking route! It can be quite exhausting, especially if it's freezing.\\nThe Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Centre gave spectacular views and thank goodness it offered inside viewing areas as the galeforce, icy wind was too much for me to cope with! Lobby of the Chrysler Building and Empire State were good too. Lots of UK shops in NY too - surprised by how many actually. The Statue of Liberty was great - remember to book tickets to the Crown well in advance if you want to go all the way up, otherwise you'll only get to the top of the pedestal. Liked the quieter street rather than avenue location of this hotel. Peaceful nights despite construction outside our window. So convenient for walking around Manhattan! The service was excellent and we got our money's worth. I thought all aspect of my stay was great. The only thing that i thought could be improved was the quality of the bed linen. It could be improved I was in town for a wedding and really enjoyed my stay at Le Parker Meridien. My room was clean, comfortable and quiet, and very modern. The hotel is very well located, easily accessible to 5th Avenue, the subway, all the tourist stuff, Times Square, restaurants, etc. Central Park is just a couple blocks away, so I was easily able to go for a great morning run. Plus, there are several coffee shops/delis around, which is great for quick, cheap(er) meals. We did have cocktails at the Nave bar one night, which was great for people watching. I would stay here again. The staff is excellent...........every time! We love the location, Norma's, and the lobby bar, I think it's relatively a recent addition. Sometimes it's a bit noisy at night; could be if construction is going on nearby. We hope to be back soon! Heads up, a $100/night deposit will be charged to your credit card. I wish check-in had explained that. Instead I got a shock when I checked my credit card balance. One phone call to the front desk later, it was resolved but I was plenty worried.\\nOther than that, come for the food. Norma' s and the Burger Joint are excellent. In such a lovely public space for the ground floor I wa surprised to have a cloth curtain for a closet door. Yet the ability to turn the tv was creative; and the long desk enabled lots of uses for that counter. But the service in every way was so unobtrusive and yet always ready to be helpful! However, when I asked for the business center I was guided to the cmputer for boarding passes - which would have cost extra $$ to use. No idea if wifi exists. Rooms are nice size. Staff is great. I still can't believe that upscale hotels in NYC don't offer free wifi, that is a miss on their part My wife was traveling to NYC to sing at Carnegie Hall (which is right next door to Le Parker Meridien). Her room was being paid for by the organization she was traveling with but mine was not. The Reservations Manager, AnnMarie Lockmeyer, went above and beyond to offer me the same group rate as the organization my wife was traveling with. Even if I had paid the full room rate I would have been extreamly satisfied with my stay...but saving a few bucks doesn't hurt. Thank you Le Parker Meridien...you will have my buisness next time I come to NYC, whether it's business or pleasure.\\nJason I know in NYC, location is everything but you kinda expect more especially when you upgrade to a suite. \\nThe Pros: The location is ideal especially if you plan on watching a show in broadway or checking out MoMa. There's a Starbucks right across, and a Duane Reade on the next block. It also has a burger joint at the ground level which serves good burgers. \\nThe suite we had was very spacious and the layout is nice especially if you're expecting visitors as privacy of the bedroom is maintained. \\nThe Cons: You need to pay for amenities when in other hotels it's free. There's no complimentary water, no free wifi or LAN internet access, there's no coffee machine (but the room service delivers coffee 24 hours), there's a mini-bar but it doesn't function as a personal ref. The suite we stayed in had no bathtub. Everything you would hope for. Very relaxing. Street noise is only drawback, so ask for an upper floor. Almost excellent. Construction outside windows facing North are no fun, but that's not the hotel's fault. I'm a stickler for coffee pots in the room and think every hotel room on the planet should have one. (I'll pay as i do for items in the mini-bar in the room) Great revenue opportunity for all the hotels. The reason it wasn't excellent (amazingly) was Norma's for breakfast. The world's best breakfast menu, the world's highest priced breakfast, and the duck confit hash was awful. Last night's duck for sure, and a melange of other leftovers that was just sad. Anyone can make great french toast. make a great duck hash, and I'm all-in.\\nMaybe the menu is too ambitious. Cut it back and do everything well. That said, it's a world-class hotel, and the cartoons in the elevator are worth the stay. I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for a work trip. I usually stay at the W in Times Square, but I decided to try something new since I would be in town almost a week. Overall, I had a very nice experience. \\nBe sure to get a room with a park view if you can. The rates are a little bit pricey, but that is to be expected in mid-town Manhattan. Normas is great for breakfast or brunch and the Burger Joint is a nice surpise. Overall, the hotel service was wonderful (even if a bit pretentious). I stayed six nights and only had only one negative experience when the waiter at Norma's barely spoke two words to me. The gravity gym is AWESOME compared to the usual hotel gyms. There is a $10 day-use fee for the gym but I thought it was worth it. The television in my room was awful (bad picture/clicking and popping sounds). This did not bother me so much, but I would have thought this hotel would have had better televisions in it. My seventeen year old daughter and I went with several other moms and daughters to New York to search for colleges. This hotel is in a good location. It was close to shopping, subway stations, great restaurants, and taxi service. We walked to the theatre district and all over the city from the hotel. The concierge was very helpful with dinner suggestions and made several reservations for us at great places. The bar was quaint and the service was great. The burger joint at the hotel was yummy!! I met the manager and he was very nice and I would definitely stay there again. Thanks to Urban Daddy,I picked up a special for my husband as a Valentine's surprise.We made the decision to stay over and it was great. As stated,service and staff were phenominal. The view of the park is fantastic and room service was prompt. The rooms were a nice size but definitely could use a makeover as it was a bit dated. The room could use an I Pod docking station as well.Try the chocolate covered strawberries! The lobby bar is amazing. I stayed in this hotel in December of 2010 and again in February as I traveled to NYC for Fashion Week. I love the location and it offers a nice energy level without feeling chaotic or like it is trying too hard. Norma's is an absolute must and the perfect way to start each day. We picked the hotel for a mixed use business and leisure trip. The hotel was ideally situated for our business meeting, but the location for after the business was even better. Walk to central park, dinning, entertainment was all perfect. We stayed in a junior suite that we were very impressed with both in size and quality for NYC! We are looking forward to returning when we have more time in town! The staff was amazing. The rooms were well appointed. It is located in the middle of everything/place you could possibly want to do/see. The price is quite competitive considering the comp set and well worth every penny. The staff is very friendly and willing to assist.The rooms are neat,clean with ample space.The location could not be better.We walked to many places for eating and entertainment.I have stayed at this hotel before and plan to return. This was an absolutely fabulous hotel experience. The staff were super attentive and friendly. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The gym was amazing. The restaurant, Norma's was incredible (I probably put on a kilo per meal, but who's counting?). The location is right in the middle of everything.\\nI really would find it difficult to fault the place - the only thing I could think of would be that I think the gym should be free for hotel guests, and probably free wifi too. But beyond that I was extremely happy in every way. I'll be back, without a doubt! A truly awesome place to stay for my first time in the city. Walking distance to most Manhattan hotspots and views of Central Park, while all the while being affordable for the budget traveler. The staff was very courteous and helpful and the room service was prompt and delicious. A very good traveling experience. The quality of the service was superb...the food was excellent...the recommendations from staff were spot-on...the room was quiet, well-regulated temperature both air and shower water...we were very happy we were able to upgrade to a junior suite at a higher level at a nominal additional fee suggested by the check-in staff...the quiet room was surprising since we were in the heart of Manhattan, we expected more noise in the halls and from the street below, but non-existent! The Burger Joint was a perfect stop after check-in for a quick bite and the bar was a great place to unwind after dinner and a show...and also great in the morning for french press coffee and a croissant while waiting for a table at the world-class breakfast served at Norma's! The OJ and fresh-squeezed grapefruit at breakfast was unbelievably good! Well If there is one person in this city who should be training front desk employees on how to do a job it should be Michael. Most hotels ask you for ID and Credit card and then send you on your way like you are a number. Michael actually took the time and asked what i was in town for? Wow the idea that someone actually cared to ask me that was remarkable in itself. When i told him how i'll be in the hotel for 10 days for work he helped me so much to get the best available room possible for my extended stay. \\nI always stay at this hotel in NYC. The Food is the best, the gym is the best, the staff are great, the pool is amazing, the views are amazing, the location is amazing, the soaps in the shower are great....the herman miller desk chairs are awesome too...\\nThis review would not be taken seriously if i didn't point out a few flaws....So i will...\\n1) Its time to upgrade the bedside alarm clocks to have ipod/iphone connectors\\n2) please put coffee in the room too!\\nThis place is really great. Thanks for being so nice to your guests. my wife and i were in the city for a wine and food tasting. we are loyal starwood hotel members and wanted to try something new. so we booked in at le parker meridien. we stayed over one night. check in and check out were great - both took a minimal amount of time and the gentleman working the desk was personable, friendly and accommodating. \\nwe were very pleased to find the room very clean and modern. we have been concerned about staying at hotels in the nyc area because of all the bedbug reports. but our room was exceptionally clean and after a quick inspection we declared the bed worthy of sleeping in. indeed, we had no problems. my only qualm with the room is that there was a tub instead of a shower stall. and the shower head seemed a bit dated. but that is me being really nit-picky. as the room and bathroom were both modern, very clean and quite acceptable.\\nwe didn't make use of the gym or hotel food services (although both looked fantastic - especially the gym, not your average hotel gym).\\nall in all - a great stay at a great hotel. Perfect, noiseless sleep. The view on the hotel backyard was not nice, but at least it was completely noiseless. I was lucky to get a high floor (22) and to have a nice quiet night. Rooms are airy and modern. Nice, firm bed. Great location. What's not to like? The hotel was nice. I was fortunate to get upgraded to a junior suite or I probably wouldn't have been happy with the room size. Bar drinks run 20-22 dollars each. Room service food was \"fair\". Breakfast for 1 was $50. I liked this hotel. The rooms were modern and clean. The bathroom was small but OK. The one downside for me was the lack of coffe maker in the room. Room service charged a $5 delivery fee plus 16% gratuity which made a small pot of coffee $16. The upside is that there is a Strbucks right across the street. I was there during a blizzard. Flights were cancelled and we were afraid we would not have a room. The Parker not only allowed us to keep our room but when we were able to get out a day earlier than planned they did not charge us the late cancellation fee (which is their policy) due to the extenuating circumstances. nice. Stayed here recently for a weekend getaway. Check-in was prompt and efficient. We were able to check in even though it was only 10:30am, which was a huge convenience. Room was clean and comfortable and had a view of Central Park. Modern decor, which isn't my wife's favorite, but I don't mind. While unpacking was surprised there was not one drawer in the room. Two decent sized closets with plenty of hangars, but no drawers to store socks, t-shirts and other small items. Shelf in closet worked for a two night stay but would be inconvenient for longer. There is a decent sized work table with phone, great Aeron chair and good lighting. Couldn't connect with the wired internet, and front desk wasn't much help, but wifi worked fine, although $17 per 24 hours. When going to bed noticed there were no black-out curtains. When checking out I inquired and was told there was a control next to the window. It must have been well hidden and the curtains very well hidden as they were not to be seen. We've always enjoyed the Parker-Meridien, for its lovely rooms, for its central location, but mainly for the burger joint in the lobby (great food!), for the rooftop pool, and for breakfast at Norma's, always interesting and delicious. We do not like the policy of charging for internet access ($17! I think - I don't buy on principle). Very nice hotel having stayed here before. But you have no access to the thermostat and the room was ice cold! I slept the first night with my winter jacket on, since there was no extra blanket available either. Upon check in we were informed there would be no running water for the next hour, that was disappointing. Also, we booked through expedia one month before, then right before we left we checked the rates at the hotel itself and found it to be almost half the price we paid. It took many, many phone calls and over an hour of our time but we were able to get the price reduced although not as low as it could have gone. Too bad! We've stayed at Le Parker Meridien several times and always enjoy every moment of our stay. It is perfectly located within easy walking distance of 5th Ave., Carnegie Hall, the Time-Warner Center and Central Park and is close by to plenty of good shops and restaurants.\\nBut it is the hotel itself that brings us back and first of all you have to acknowledge that the staff are, in our experience, unfailingly polite, courteous, and helpful. We particularly have to commend and say a very big \"Thank You\" to Maria and the entire Concierge team who spent as much time as we needed helping us sort out revised travel plans in the difficult days after the Boxing Day blizzard hit the city. We cannot think that any finer Concierge desk operates at any New York hotel.\\nThe modern rooms are pleasant and well furnished and the beds superbly comfortable being sizeable and having very fine linen. Try and get a high room with a Park view. Housekeeping is spot on.\\nAnd please be advised - until you've eaten breakfast or brunch in Norma's (you'll need to book ahead) after a swim in the superb pool at the top of the hotel then you have not done justice to your New York experience.\\nWe can't imagine staying anywhere else in NYC. I can hardly say enough about Le Parker Meridien. Yes, it is pricey. Yes the drinks in Nave are $12. But this is without a doubt the finest hotel experience I've had in New York and one of the finest I've had in the world. Call, reserve, stay. Ask for a room above the 35th floor facing Central Park. Ask anyone at the hotel for anything you need, and you'll get it post haste.\\nIn a service industry sadly devoid of great service, Le Parker Meridien is a wonderful exception. The location of this hotel is ideal. Two blocks to Central Park, 7 blocks to Lincoln Center. Excellent breakfast at Norma's in the lobby. We were upgraded to a room with a view of the Park. Magnificent. Room Service and housekeeping were quick. Room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. i would highly recommend and I will definitely return. Recently needed to attend a business meeting in NY - booked at Meridien for the rewards points. But was pleasantly surprised at the total experience - (apart from slow elevators), the experience (from the great room, top notch toiletries, view of central park, excellent breakfast in the restaurant, amazing burger in the secret burger dive) was first rate. Can't wait to go back. Arriving in NYC with great mounds of snow making traffic one great snarl, we entered the lobby a bit frazzled only to find half a dozen luggage carts blocking our way to reception. Just as I was mentally calculating how many hours it would be till we got into our room, a young man appeared at my elbow and escorted me directly to smiling Emilie at the desk who continued to erase my anxiety. With only a few words exchanged, she'd quickly agreed to my request for something \"high\" by offering an upgrade to a Central Park view for a nominal additional fee. A minute later we were on our way to the 37th floor, and suddenly we were entering our sleek, spacious room with a dead-on view of the park. What can I say? It was nothing short of stunning, and we were even more in love with Le Parker Meridien. Lots of cool features in the room: massive, comfortable bed with individual reading lights, the bathroom ( with tub!) with its Peter Thomas Roth amenities, a wonderful rooftop pool 4 flights up, Norma's, the Burger Joint and the Knave for all our dining needs an elevator ride away. No matter where we ventured in the hotel, we were met with warm smiles from helpful staff. We loved it. Wish we could have stayed longer. Would definitely return! This is a very nice hotel. The room was pretty small... it has a very good restaurant downstairs and I heard the burger place is amazing although the line was so long I did not get to try it. \\nIt is close to many attractions. Honestly, theres nothing to go crazy about if youre paying 500$ a night! The service was wonderful at the Le Parker Meridien. The staff was amazing at the business meeting, the area was keep clean and the food was fresh. The only problem I encountered was a lack of cell phone service in my room, I had to go to the lobby to use my cell phone. Quick check in/out, responsive concierge, comfortable bed, fine selection of pillows, thick towels, efficient thermal control, spacious room, functional bathroom, clean, quiet, swimming pool overlooking Manhattan, great breakfast at Norma’s, fantastic room service, gorgeous lobby bar, friendly staff, and most importantly: location...location. In this super expensive city, Parker Medidien stnads out for it's value for money. Perfect location; remarkably spacious rooms; Norma's is indeed the best brunch in town and the Burger Joint is a fun spot with excellent hamburgers, fries and milkshakes (or Sam Adams if you prefer). The doormen and bellmen have been on staff for years, and they have an amazing ability to remember guests and make them feel like they are being welcomoed home every time they return. I love the health club and the rooftop (four season) swimming pool. Location is good (depending on your plans), but overall I was very disappointed in this hotel. I expected cleaner, more amenities, a more comfortable bed, a better TV, etc.... more like what you'd expect from a higher end Starwood chain. Instead, the TV was old with poor reception, the bed was very uncomfortable, the AC/heat controls didn't work, everything seemed a bit dingy, had to pay to use the fitness center, and if you wanted to actually look in the mirror as you blow dried your hair, you couldn't since the hotel had what I consider the cheap way out by having the blow dryer stuck to the wall (and the mirror wasn't positioned close to it). All in all, wouldn't stay here again-- especially considering the thousands of other choices in NYC. Very large rooms for New York hotels. Service very good and friendly. Ideal slocation on 57th/56th and 7th Avenue. Could walk anywhere and we did. Would return again to same hotel next time. Would like to see tea and coffee facilities inroom though. Would be nice to be able to make a drink when you wake up in the morning. Can't beat the location and the hotel has a great hip vibe. Managed to check-in at 7 am (got in on a red eye) as a room was available. Concierge was also great - tried to score us reservations at babbo but of course, he's no magician! But he tried. BUT we had issues with our TV reception - it was like watching snow, after a while, I wanted to throw up. We called three times and each time they said someone was \"coming right up\" but no one ever showed. We never got our TV to work during our weekend stay. You will ask where you are, as the hotel is luxurious and with an european feel to it. There is a feeling of coziness not familiar to most hotels. The smiling faces and friendliness of staff make you feel right at home. The suite was comfortable, peaceful and well attended. Room service is the best and staff are very kind and friendly, and the food is well prepared, presented, and delicious. I consider Le Parker Meridien to be my home-away-from- home in New York City. we loved the friendly staff and the comfortable room. it's nice to have nice amenities and a comfy bed. lots of closet space too. we will be back! My two daughters (22 and 18) and I stayed here for 4 nights (26-30 Oct 2010). We’d asked for two adjoining or interconnecting rooms. On our first night we were put on two different floors! After a little insistence, the guys at the front desk did a bit of shuffling about with their bookings and managed to get us two interconnecting rooms on the 17th floor, which was more than satisfactory. So they get Brownie points; but why weren’t we given that in the first place, as we’d made our booking weeks in advance?\\nI would generally concur with most of the points made by other reviewers: it’s quite a good hotel, but lacks that ‘extra something’ which makes a good hotel excellent; and for the price, I would expect something a bit better. \\nOn the plus side: service was generally good, polite and attentive, even though the hotel was evidently very busy (in fact – we were told – full). The location is good: Subway station next door; very easy to get to shops (especially important with young daughters!); within a stone’s throw of Central Park and the “Museum Mile”; and right next to Carnegie Hall. \\nRooms are generally well appointed, and quite a good size for New York. Bathrooms a bit pokey though, and need sprucing up (cracked tiles, loose fitments etc). Beds perfectly comfortable and spacious. Old fashioned TVs in rooms (though quite serviceable). Wi-Fi in room over $16 a day (at these prices, that should be included in rate). Very expensive and touch-sensitive mini-bar: just remove a bottle from the shelf and you’ll be charged for it, even if you put it back unopened. At least the guy on the front desk warned us about this – and even advised us to buy our own drinks from the nearby store (I won’t name him, the hotel would probably sack him!).\\nAnd the minus side? One major gripe we had was that residents evidently do not get priority for breakfast. The hotel is open to non-residents for breakfast, and we were told we had to wait 25 minutes for a table, since we had no reservation! I have NEVER had to reserve a table for breakfast at a hotel where I was a guest. That’s quite unacceptable. We only had breakfast there once (it was not included in the room price – why not?); and though it was good, it was expensive (reckon on nearly $100 for three). You can breakfast for less than half that price – maybe not as refined an experience, but more than satisfying – at the various delis within yards of the hotel front door. The Carnegie Deli on 7th Ave / 55th St is particularly good. \\nThe swimming pool was a disappointment – small and crowded, so we decided against swimming there in the end. NB if you want a sauna after your swim, you have to go all the way from the 41st floor where the pool is, to the lower basement (two changes of lift) where the gym is, and pay a $10 ‘access fee’.\\nThe bar at the hotel is a long corridor leading out to the 57th St entrance on the other side of the building: it has unpleasantly loud music and never any room to sit. There is no restaurant at the hotel apart from the burger joint, which is much as described by other reviewers: incongruously (and self-consciously) a spit-and-sawdust affair hidden away from the marble columns of the hotel reception by a large curtain (felt a bit like going into a strip-joint!); heaving with people queuing at the steaming kitchen bar where you place your order; burgers served à la McDonalds in paper bags to be eaten with fingers at the wooden tables (assuming you can find a seat). But, having said that, truly wonderful burgers that McDonalds would fail to comprehend.\\nWhile I can’t say the Parker Meridien is a bad hotel, it doesn’t compare very favourably even with other Meridien hotels I have stayed in (such as the Meridien Kuala Lumpur, which is outstanding). It is not cheap, and for the price, I would expect something better and a bit more classy – it evidently caters for a possibly uncritical business clientele, given the number of corporate functions that seemed to be going on when we were there; and I suspect relies on this ‘package’ trade to keep it going rather than paying attention to the needs of individual travellers and families.\\nOverall, I think there are better places in New York for the money. My husband and I recently stayed at the Le Parker Meridian hotel when we got married in New York on New Years Eve 2010. As we were getting married (up the Empire State Building) there was so much to organise but our concierge Maria Bortoluzzi was fantastically helpful. Our room (a Junior Suite) was extremely spacious and comfortable and even though we had arrived at the height of the recent snow blizzard the service was brilliant. We had our reception at a local restaurant (Benoits - very very nice) then had cake and champagne in the Nave bar at Le Parker and all the staff were very helpful and friendly. if there was one thing against this hotel I would say that the food and especially the drinks were quite expensive but probably on a par with top class New York hotels. Woud definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a classy stay and New York is an amazine city....will definitely visit again. We chose this hotel from a brochure by our tour operator & were simply blown away by the helpfulness of the staff. Front desk helped with where to stand on New Years Eve, concierge sorted out our errant shuttle service & the bar staff made us feel very valued.\\nLocation was so close to everything. The cartoons in the lift were the finishing touch for both my daughter & my husband! Everyone was very nice and helpful\\nRoom and bathroom decent size for NYC - Very nice restaurants: both Norma's for upscale breakfast / brunch, and the beautiful \"corridor\" for breakfast\\n- Nice and clean rooms Courteous service\\nGreat mid-town location\\nBest breakfast in town\\nReasonable NYC hotel rates\\nUnbeatable shower-power Staff is incredibly friendly. Quiet, beautiful views. Very comfortable stay. This is a nice quiet spot with very friendly and attentive staff. The concierge desk was the most helpful I think I've encountered outside a resort (I believe the person that helped us during our stay was Michael). The rooms are clean and comfortable and spacious and there's really strong pressure in the shower which I always appreciate.\\nIt's a short walk to the south end of Central Park and not very far to get to Times Square. And Starbucks at both the 56 & 57 Street entrances. \\nWe loved this spot. FANTASTIC. I live in hotels and as a Starwood Platinum member I make a conscious effort to stay at their properties in order to benefit from the pampering \"most\" hotels offer. After walking out from a prepaid rate at the new Element times square (don't stay there), my family and I along with friends and their family checked into the Parker Meridien. We were both upgraded to Junior suites, the largest I have seen in NYC. Although it has probably been a decade since the rooms were last renovated, they are still modern, clean and up to date. I have stayed at much more luxurious hotels and enjoyed them as well, but this still just felt right. In a city of small rooms and service with an attitude, the Parker Meridien shines. \\nThe hotel is a home away from home offering so much more than just a room. Friendly courteous staff from the front desk to housekeeping, a pool with an incredible view, good food for a reasonable price (try the burger joint) and a spectacular gym (which I should have used)! Peter Thomas Roth toiletries ( I love that they probably chose these because the font is the same as Le Meridien's), and very witty branding. Instead of getting pissed off that it was an electronic minibar and couldn't be used as a fridge, I laughed at the memo attached as I did with all of their marketing material. \\nI am a perfectionist and find problems with hotels everywhere I stay. I can honestly say I walked out of this property feeling refreshed and happy with the feeling of money well spent. Le Parker Meridien is my new hotel of choice in the big apple! A warm welcome, great room, incredible service and excellent location... Central Park just a few minutes away, what else? We traveled to NYC for a rare weekend away with no business obligations on our itinerary. Had a terrific experience at Le Parker Meridien, beginning with a very welcoming experience checking in. Booked a junior suite with park view using Starwood points, then I inquired about upgrade possibilities at check in. Decided to pay to upgrade to a Diplomatic Suite. Outstanding, very spacious room on the 34th floor with a partial view of Central Park and a partial view of the mid-town skyline. Oversized bathroom off the bedroom plus another full bath off the dining room. Very clean. Very large living and dining area where the views were. Hotel room had a different look and feel than some we stay in (lighter wood/more modern feel). We were skeptical about what looked like a futon bed but it was surprisingly comfortable. \\nHighly recommend \"Norma's\" restaurant for breakfast. Extensive, creative, fun menu and of course, pricey, but it's NY. Long wait for a table but we called down ahead and they fit us in ahead of non-guests. Our food tasted great and service was attentive despite the frenzy.\\nHotel is in a great location if you want to be near the park but not pay to stay right on it. Easy walking access to all sorts of places, restaurants, etc. Can't wait to return! Recently stayed here Thurs-Sun, one of the better hotels in NYC. If you are expecting curt NYC staff and small dingy rooms, get ready to be surprised!! The rooms are spacious and the furniture is put in to maximize the space usage, while leaving room to move. The staff is very attentive, friendly and always smiling. All my requests were attended to within minutes - great service makes everything else better! From the moment we arrived weary from a 17.5 hour flight, we were greeted warmly. The staff were supremely helpful. There are many hotels in New York, but the Le Parker Meridien excels in customer service. We arrived 2 days after a blizzard, a 3 hour delayed flight and after having waited 2 and a half hours at JFK for our bags and still the front desk team made us feel relaxed and at home the minute we walked in the door. The location of the hotel is perfect and the concierge team were terrific. This trip was for pleasure but I would stay there for business too. Our first visit to New York and we could not have asked for a better location, 2 mins from Central Park, 10 mins from Times Square and 5 mins from the shops of 5th Avenue. On arrival we were a little concerned about the scaffolding which was decorating the front of the Hotel but a very impressive interior awaited with lovely rooms and an great atmosphere. The Hotel was very clean and well presented, the Staff were very helpful and we would definitely stay there again. So I'm here, right this minute, and no problems AT ALL.\\nThe front of the hotel is under renovation, which was slightly awkward, but the hotel itself is great.\\nFront desk personnel were very friendly to the point of recommending places to go, concierges have both been very helpful with shows & places to eat, the bar/coffee place is great, the gym is amazing.\\nWe're in a Jnr Suite, upgraded at no fee against a 12k points reservation.\\nGreat room - she is from NYC and says this is a great hotel and a great room.\\nSpacious, nice, comfourtable, and - similar to the Parker in PalmSprings - really top notch toiletries.\\nNone of the listed problems with heater or A/C.\\nAs far as my experience goes, this place has gotten a bum rap.\\nI'd stay here again, and would recommend it to others. The PM Hotel is in a central location and it's perfect if you want to visit new york and enjoy the end of the year in famous Time Square. The rooms are very comfortable and full equipped . \\nJust the wireless Lan was not free and a little bit expensive (16 dollars for day). \\nIn the lobby of the hotel there is a very nice pub that makes very good hamburger. Someone says that the hamburger served in that pub is fifth best hamburger of new York. \\nUnfortunately I was not in the swimming pull on the top of the hotel. Great hotel, staff efficient and quick... love the bar and the rooms are huge for NYC!!! I very much appreciated the personal service and the warm welcome that we received from all employees. The hotel is physically beautiful, particularly the lobby and bar area. The rooms are interesting, well-appointed and very comfortable. Service was, overally, simply outstanding. From the moment we walked into the hotel the staff was courteous and professional. Reina at the front desk understood we were tired and hungry from our long trip and got us set up quickly and made some great restaurant suggestions nearby. The rooms were very nice and quite large, very modern and nice bathroom cool hip furniture. The hidden surprise was the Burger Joint located in the hotel. Great food and completely different atmosphere than the rest of the hotel. Always a line there for a reason. This was our first time staying at the Le Parker. The staff was helpful and curtious, the room was delightful all at a great price. The Burger Joint was a totally unexpected awesome eatery! After staying at the LPM, New York for the past three months, I feel compelled to provide an update. \\nLocation: Great! Close to Central Park, Columbus Circle, not in Times Square but close enough to walk, great shopping in the area, etc... Close to the Theatre District and Carnegie Hall.\\nFront Desk & Bell Staff: Consistent, courteous, and very helpful. They have a multi-lingual staff (observed Japanese and Spanish speaking). I noticed the staff exercising extreme patience and care with foreign visitors.. Kudos to the Front Desk!\\nFood: Room Service is great, and they deliver the food in a timely (as in still warm) manner. The Burger Joint is a \"good\" burger, not the best I have had (i.e. Port-of-Call in New Orleans). However, if you get the crave, this place delivers the goods.\\nNorma's, is expensive! I treated my two 13 year old nieces to breakfast, and it was @ $99.. I went back for the pancakes by myself, and they were tasty. This is a great breakfast restaurant, sans the prices.\\nFitness Centre: Spacious, plenty of machines and weights plus programmable work-outs, free towels, fruit, and a pleasant staff.. I joined Boom Fitness because it is across from my place of employment, but spend more time at Gravity than Boom. If you are a Starwood Platinum, the cost is free..else $10. Olympic size pool included! One word sums up Gravity Fitness Centre: Awesome! \\nInternet: For a fee unless you are Starwood Platinum. Internet speed is \"Ok to Good\" but not the best I have experienced in NYC. \\nI only have one complaint -- According to SPG policies, a Platinum Member should receive complimentary Upgrades when available. Over the past month, there have been Jr. Suite Upgrades available, but they were not offered to me even when requested. This is frustrating as they hold the rooms for Customers who pay the extra $$$ for the price of the rooms. Since I am both a Platinum Member and loyal long-term Customer it would \"seem\" to be good business to offer the Upgrades to someone who stays at the hotel on a week-to-week basis vs. someone there for a few days. Also, I travel with music equipment and the extra room is necessity for me... \\nOverall, I still prefer LPM above the other area Hotels (including comparable 5 star locations). I have been in NYC for one year and tried different hotels in Mid-Town, Down-Town, and Chelsea (including other Starwood properties).You cannot go wrong with this place! Had much trepidation after reading the nasty stuff herein, but just got back from a two night stay during the NYC Blizzard of 2010...highly recommended hotel!\\nWe have stayed here for two nights after Xmas as our \"family treat\" every year for 5 years, and once again this is our favorite place in NYC! Perfect location and great accomodations. None of the issues aforementioned.\\nI booked an offered upgrade to a Jr Suite for us and had a separate park view King room for kids, both on the 25th floor. Both were well-maintained and very nice rooms...no complaints! I am beginning to wonder if there is a concerted effrot to dis this hotel!?\\nStaff was uniformly friendly and the bathrooms were spotless. Great fun for the entire \"crew!\"\\nAlready planning our stay for next year! We love it here - from when we check in to when we check out. Michael takes great care of us at the front desk. We always love the rooms he gives us, and Bob is our favorite waiter at Norma's, both who remember us each time we come. That feels great. GREAT location. This hotel always seems to get mixed reviews and when looking on trip adviser you will probably think great hotel or oh gosh what have I done! \\nWe stayed here around the same time last year and due to the fab location thought we would give it a try again on a trip to NYC with my husbands mum. I'm glad we chose this hotel again as she loved her room overlooking the park and also knave which she said had the best coffee, not being a coffee drinker I couldn't say but the atmosphere in knave was really nice. \\nWe also had a room overlooking the park which was lovely, personally I think the rooms are nice they are quite roomy which I understand is a bit of a treat in nyc. I admit that the TV's should be updated to flat screens but then you don't come to nyc to watch tv! \\nAlso beware of the fridge if you touch this you will be charged we never used it on either trip but it is worth noting from previous reviews. \\nWhile staying at this hotel we went to Normas and I had their amazing blueberry pancakes which were very good, hubby had the breakfast basket which he seemed to enjoy. The staff in Normas also ask if you would like orange juice, which is some of the best orange juice I have ever had but beware it costs $9 a glass worth it but a bit of a shock if your on a budget.\\nWe also went to the burger joint as well which was really good too but could be considered pricey compared to the no of burger joints available in nyc but would recommend you try if you get the chance and the staff in there are lovely. \\nThe only things I would change about this hotel would be that they should have free wifi as you have to pay for this and in most hotels free wifi comes as standard. Also I'm not overly keen on the cartoons in the elevator I personally would like to have something else on maybe a news channel instead. \\nOverall I think this is a really good hotel and would recommend a stay at Le Parker. The staff was friendly and helpful, hotel is cozy and comfortable. It is in walking distance of of many majoer attractions, not to mention being next door to Carnegie Hall. I hope to stay there again on my next visit t o New York. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the view from the pool deck is awesome. I had a great experience here. I received excellent service at check-in and check-out. I arrived at about 9 am and didn't expect to get a room until after 3 pm, but the person who checked me in found me a great room that was ready by about 10 am. The room was a good size by any standard, had a great TV, a large desk and chair, and a huge window. The closet was a bit tiny, but that was a minor thing for me. The bathroom was modern, had plenty of mirrors, and plenty of hot water with great water pressure. The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept great both nights. Even on the 37th floor, I could hear the city below, but it's New York and noise is part of it. The lobby and waiting areas were modern with plenty of places to sit and people-watch. It had a beautiful Christmas tree, too. The concierge was friendly and helpful. Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and welcoming. My favorite part of staying there was hanging out at Knave at night. It has great coffee, great drinks, and great sandwiches and cookies. Their famous mocha lives up to its reputation! The ambiance and atmosphere is very chic, with high ceilings, comfortable couches and chairs with red accents. It's lit with low-light and candles, which adds to the sophisticated feel. I hung out there two nights in a row and planned to read, but found that I enjoyed watching the people and talking to other patrons more so I hardly read at all. It is also located in a great part of Manhattan, a couple of blocks from Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center, and an easy walk to Times Square and the theater district. Overall, I had a great experience and look forward to coming back soon. My daughter and I stayed here for five nights in November. Our room\\nwas amazing. It was twice as large as any hotel we had stayed at in\\nNYC. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Very close to Central\\nPark and 5th Avenue shopping. A really great location and a great\\nplace to stay! Driving into the city and leaving the car at the door of the Parker Meridien could not have been easier. This was my first time, and the staff was welcoming and efficient. Check in was a breeze, and the same was true leaving, when the car was produced with less than a five minute wait. I look forward to returning. I have very High expectations in Hotel rooms... & am VERY picky about cleanliness .I can honestly say, that this was one of the top 5 hotels Ive stayed in.. The staff was Great.. Very friendly & accommodating... The location is perfect.. We walked to Time square, Radio City & Rockefeller center in minutes.. The subway is convenient as well. The room was clean & the bed was VERY comfortable.. Its a great place to stay with families.. They give the kids Coloring books & crayons upon check in.. They have a 20ft Wii that my littles guys loved...The Burger Joint was yummy! The pool was a great retreat for the kids when it was raining.. The room was fairly large for NYC.. We stayed in the Jr Suite.. definitely recommended for families\\nDont let some of the poor reviews below steer you away... Im sure glad I didn't! We had a WONDERFUL time.. Thanks Le Parker Meridian! My wife and I stayed there Monday night. The room was small but comfortable and the TV was aged and made a crackling noise when on. But what got my goat was when I found out in the mornign that the shower didn't work - no water came out at all. As had only allowed enough time to get ready as usual, I had to skip the shower to make my appointment in the morning. When I adivsed the manager at checkout, she apologized but offered nothing else except to use another room for a shower, which would be ok if I had planned on that, and in a tone like it was my fault for not planning appropriately. Sorry, but that's the last time I stay there. Stayed here over Christmas and new year 2009-2010. Hotel rooms are elegant, if a bit dated - but really nothing special. Booked a suite which had a substantial kitchen (including proper stove etc) but no cooking utensils or even cutlery and plates. We requested these and they tried to charge us extra! Also, internet prices and gym pricing is exorbitant.\\nBar downstairs is very nice (if overpriced) and burger joint in basement always had a long queue so didn't make it there. The lobby always resembled an airport - very busy kids everywhere (often eating McDonalds) and generally unpleasant. I was traveling with my daughter and a grand daughte (a six year old). The staff were very cordial. Our room was very small. We called for a roll away bed and they did bring the roll away but the staff had problems making it fit in the room so we asked him to remove it because we litterally had no place to walk or move around. We decided we would squeeze the six year old between us in bed but that didn't work so the poor little one slept on the floor. Way to crowded. Also the bed was not confortable. Take it from me; I travel often with my job. The location was great but i will not be staying at this hotel again unless they redo with better quality mattress and if I stay in a larger room. Also no coffee maker in the room. Also when we were checking out it took us a half hour ro get on the elevator from the 12th floor. Just back from a two night stay at what is probably the busiest time of year in New York (two weeks before Christmas).\\nI am SPG Platinum, but given that I was staying on points, and given how busy the hotel was, I didn't expect and didn't receive an upgrade. However, the standard room was great and huge by New York standards.\\nAll of the staff I encountered were pleasant and friendly. But the best part was how accomodating the hotel was when my flight home was delayed. Without a doubt, this was worth MUCH more to me than a room upgrade.\\nI would definitely stay at the Parker again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone! I was expecting a bit more. The room was fine, decent size, comfortable bed. Couldn't get the WiFi to work. No coffee maker in the room. TV was dated. Slow drains in the bathroom and some loose screws holding things together. Staff was friendly and helpful. Stayed with family for a single night. At check-in, they saw we had three children so upgraded us from a junior suite to a very large one bedroom suite - 2 baths, sitting area, big dining table, and great view of Central Park. Room was in great shape. Everyone on staff was very polite and helpful. Pool on the top floor was a big hit with the kids. Breakfast at Norma's was fantastic (~$28 / head (before tip). Physically the LPM is not on par with the NY Palace, Four Seasons, etc., but it's also significantly cheaper. A great upgrade from the standard Mariott, Sheraton, etc. if you can swing it. As a frequent traveller to NYC for both business and pleasure I have stayed at many 4 & 5 star hotels in the city. This trip for pleasure I decided to cash in on a our starwood points so thought I would try the LeParker. This trip I brought my 75 year old aunt so needed to book a suite. I used Starwood points for two nights and paid for the other two. I booked a junior suite which I was told when making the reservations that the suite would have a park view which I wanted so my aunt could have a great view of the park. Upon checking in I was told that we had acutally been upgraded to a better room. Incidentally...we were NOT in an upgraded room, but had a city view room on the 23rd floor so had a view of another building! When I called to let them know that the room wasn't to my satisfaction I was basically told there wasn't anything they could do about it. Considering the room was a suite there were only towels and robes for one person. EVERY DAY..... I had to call and ask for more towels, robes, glass for the bathroom (the shot glasses in the bathroom don't count!), tissues etc. --- not sure why they coudln't figure it out on the first day!! The little extras that one has come to expect in a four star hotel were seriously lacking!! I can't imagine a hotel that doesn't have a little coffee maker in the room especially in a suite. I was less than pleased with the cleanliness of the room...mold in the shower...ick. I was told there aren't any exhaust fans in any of the rooms which was the cause of the mold problem. I realize that I am only 5'3\", but the mirrors were mounted too high for me to use and the make up mirror was located on the wall which wasn't accesible unless you crawled over the toliet. The moving/rotating entertainment in the middle of the room was rather cleaver, but not very user friendly because if one person is watching TV in the bedroom the back of the tv with the speakers etc are facing the living room----so it makes it very impractical to use if one person wants to rest in one area and someone else wants to watch TV in the other area. The burger joint in the lobby had GREAT burgers and we luckly got there before the line got too long. Food was super. The king bed in the suite was a platform bed which made it very hard, uncomfortable, and is in need of a serious mattress update. I had to laugh when we called to have the sofa bed opened when we left for dinner....housekeeping took the pillows off of the KING bed to use on the sofa sleeper bed!! I had to AGAIN call for housekeeping/front desk. None of these minor issues would normally cause me concern in a hotel, but all these little annoyances just added up and the manager on duty was apathetic at best to follow up with our concerns. He did tell me that someone from customer service would call me on the monday that we checked out, but we never recieved that follow up phone call. The hotel is in a fabulous location, but that is about it. I was left with the impression that the staff at the LeParker just didn't want to go the extra mile for the customer so with numerious great hotels in the area I will not be staying at the Le Parker again. Stayed here over Thanksgiving Weekend with my wife and 3 young children. I'm a Starwood Platinum member, so we definitely got preferred treatment. We booked two rooms on points well in advance. Everything we requested in advance as taken care of. We stayed in a Tower Junior King Suite with an adjoining king room and were on the 32nd floor (helpful in NYC because of the street noise). They placed a refrigerator in our room before we checked in, and provided a full size crib for our 2 year old, both free of charge.\\nHalfway through our 4 day stay, we had to move rooms because someone in a nearby room must have been smoking (even though it is a non-smoking hotel), and the smell of smoke was coming into our room. They moved us to the same rooms on the 30th floor the next day, even though the hotel was very crowded.\\nThe hotel has a wonderful (but small) pool on the 41st floor overlooking Central Park. The kids loved it on the day it rained. You can even order room service to be delivered poolside.\\nThe location is just about perfect for exploring much of midtown from times square to rock center to central park to 5th ave. We walked everywhere. We did not eat at any of the restaurants except for the burger joint, which can have a long line.\\nThe kids loved the TVs in the elevators! Tom and Jerry was their favorite.\\nMy only nit pick about the rooms would be the HVAC system did not work very well at times. Otherwise, the rooms are nice sized for NYC, in good shape, and worked well for us. I stay at Le Parker for a very special wedding recently. I have travelled so much that I had some free SPG nights and thought that I would use them for this stay. When I called to book, they said they would upgrade my room, but of course when I checked in the gentleman at the front desk said they didnt have an upgrade. What he didnt know is that when he went into the back to \"talk to the manager\" that the person next to me was offered all sorts of upgrades. When he came back, I asked about those rooms which seemed to be available, but he said they weren't. What frustrates me, is that I wish they would just be honest, and not lie about things. After checking in, I went up to the room, and found it to be very cold. I played with the heat for a while and no heat came out. So I called downstairs to have someone come up. Waited 20 minutes noone came. Called again, and now talked to house keeping, and they told me that there was no request for someone to come up. So I asked again. Another 20 minutes and this poor guy showed up just to tell me that the HEATING WAS OFF!! Keep in mind this is november and not warm, but apparently some people in the hotel were too warm so they turned the heating off. So he offered to bring up a portable heater which I dont expect in a hotel like this. WOW, so dissapointing... and when I checked out and mentioned this to the staff, nothing was done. the only sad part for our trip was to leave and go back home :( \\nthe staff is simply incredible always very attentive and personal - the location is great, you can walk anywhere (shopping - theater - park - restaurant) - if you need directions just go to the concierge and they will assist you with a smile and great recommendation - we went to the burger place behind the curtain next to the concierge - i understand that it is a kind of a secret.... but the burger is really heaven. We had the best capuccino and espresso, i think we will go back to Le Parker Meridien just for this. I think the name is Knave... this is not a secret - it is in the middle of the lobby. Great pool on the top floor and the breakfast in Norma's.... just a dream!!!!\\nthe rooms are nice, with a nice view and everything you need.\\nthanks again and we will come back! I just stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. I think the standard is disappointing. I was given a room facing an office building so my blinds had to be down all the time. What was most shocking is that the first night I was there, the bathtub was choked and water couldnt drain properly. When I looked closer at the drainage, I saw a huge clump of hair. Obviously the people who cleaned the room have not been removing the hair left there by the guests. We had to call the reception to get a guy to come and clear the clump of hair so that the water could flow properly. The guy had to even pour some cleaning agent into the drainage to clear the blockage and we were told to turn on the tap and let the water run 15 mins later so that the cleaning agent could be washed away. I wouldnt stay there again. I went to visit a friend who stayed at the London Hotel just a few streets away. Honestly I would stay there the next time. The rooms are at least 3 times better than Le Parker's but the price that she paid was just slightly more than what I had to pay for Le Parker Meridien. I am in the consulting industry and have been traveling on and off to New York for about a year now. The majority of my time spent in the city, I have stayed at the Parker Meridien. Its not easy living out of a suitcase, or working long days just to come home to an empty hotel room but I can say that returning to LPM every evening was something that I looked forward to. The staff greeted me each time I checked in with a smile and even remembered my name. The room service was phenomenal and even though I was on an expense account, I chose to eat there at least 3 times a week. The gym was a huge selling point for me - classes in the morning, and open late for days when I couldn't get out of the office at a reasonable time. From someone who lived out of a hotel for a full year - I can say my experience at LMP was far and away the best I have had and I would choose to stay there every time I come to NYC whether it be for business or pleasure. We stayed 2 nights at this hotel Check-in was a breeze and because I am a starwood gold member, we were given a room with distant views of Central Park. The lobby is designed poorly...too many mirrors lining the walls made me dizzy everytime I passed through.The rooms are a decent size by NY standards and the layout allows for 2 people to navigate around. We had no problem controlling the A/C but agree that the water pressure is a little weak, but certianly not unbearable. \\nThe beds were comfortable and I have never slept better in NY - the noise from the street never made it to the 26th floor! The doorman were always pleasant and the front desk staff, although not warm and fuzzy, were far from rude. The Fitness center was AMAZING! This is our new \"go-to\" hotel. My company spent tens of thousands of dollars in rooms and conference services (hotel occupying a ballroom for the entire day, with a formal lunch served for over 100 people) over a two-day period and were nevertheless treated to the utmost rudely sarcastic and offensively uncivil behavior by the hotel staff. I cant bring myself to spell out the sentences that were hurled at us when we merely sat down in the lounge area of the cafe in the lobby. And management did absolutely nothing.\\nThere are many other and better hotels in NYC that offer polite service so why spend money on people who basically brawl and behave like members of an inner-city gang. On top of this, the rooms were dirty and the bathrooms appallingly small with a toilet lid that did not stay up, a broken handle, and gum on the filthy carpeting. \\nIf they treat high paying customers like this, imagine how they treat \"the help\" which is how one member of middle management referred to those poor hard-working cleaning staff. I have 3 complaints and that should be enough for you:\\n1. No air conditioning -- you cannot turn on your own air in your room. You must open the window (yes - hard to believe). Pretty expensive room ($450+) for NO AIR\\n2. No water pressure -- you know the kind where you have trouble staying warm and getting the shampoo out of your hair\\n3. the service/management team -- they all need a refresher course in how to speak with guests (if they ever had one before)\\nDo yourself a favor -- GO TO ANOTHER HOTEL -- where you can spend $450 and actually get AIR or a decent SHOWER (not to mention service!) This hotel is great. Awesome location, close to times square, Central park and amazing shopping. The rooms are very nice, comfortable. My only suggestion is ask for a high floor, if you are on a low floor you hear a lot of street noise.\\nNice gym, and pool on the top floor. Great hotel that feels very posh without being \"snooty\". Clean, well appointed contemporary rooms. We'll definitely stay here again! We are Gold SPG members and this place does not match category 5 hotel, and this hotel is a dissapointment. At the check-in the service was acceptable. We were given a room on the 12th floor facing construction, I complained and was given a room on the 28th floor with a partial park view. The room was filthy! I don't consider myself a picky person, but please take a look at the pictures, I could not see the time on the clock, it was so much dust on it. I complained to the manager, the room was cleaned, but not too much. There were stains on the lamps, mini bar, practically everywhere I looked it was something off. The TV was old and the mattress was even older. To make things worst: Mini bar fridge was not working, we called 3 times to have it fixed and it was not fixed and no alternative was offered. We were told we would be given a better room the next time we stay, but I am afraid there is only one first time impression. If you would like a nice 5 category hotel, stay at Westin, we were treated nicely and had the best stay there plus location is much better. Also, need to mention the security is lacking at the entry to Le Parker, my sister did not stay in the hotel and was able to come up to the room without any ID check numerious times and when we stayed at Westin, ID and keys were always required at night. and be of assistance.. My brother loved the place.. I got it for him for his 40th bday.. He and his wife loved it, but the Desk Staff was unintelligible, and rude!!!! during all of my calls to them to make these very special reservations.. At 400 plus, a night, that service should have been the 1st thing that the Le Parker needs to do some quality control on!!! 4 calls, and 4 rude, people! very friendly staff - large hotel room by New York standards!!! Clean rooms and bathrooms. Lovely comfy bed. Would definitely stay again. Easy striking distance for subway, attractions, etc. Bar a bit strange - sort of like a corridor - not tempting enough for us. Good location in Midtown. Room simple modern and comfortable. I like the eclectic bar with a french european old world funky feel. Depending on rates would stay again. The front desk was wonderful. I had received a large package with a fragile component that got shipped late and by the time I unwrapped everything, I had a big box with styrfoam peanuts, small and large bubble wrap. One call to the front desk and it was taken care of. I did not have to ask for housekeeping or engineering. The concierge and front desk were very helpful. We had a splendid stay at the Le Parker Meridien! The hotel-team was friendly and welcoming and the room (junior suite) was top... The friendly and welcoming service attitute is rare in New York. Le Parker Meridien-team: we will be back! This was our first trip to New York, But not our last. It was exciting \\nThe hotel is just a block away from Central Park, which we spent 2 days exploring\\nA short walk from Time Square Which we spent every day exploring All in all a Great get away. My family and friends have stayed at this hotel numerous times and were extremely dissatisfied during our last visit:\\n Tired-looking surroundings and appointments\\n Cheap renovations\\n Poor service\\n Arrogant, condescending manager\\n Dishonesty from manager and service people\\nThey did not handle returning guests as valued customers, and we will stay elsewhere in NYC when BEDBUG issues resolved. Visited weekend of Oct. 21-24. Decided on LPM through recommendation from a Starwood employee/exec and paid with SPG points. Great location, cool hotel at a glance. Booked room on the phone a couple of months before and noted that we had a young teen and a party of 3 total and reservationist said room has two double beds so we were OK with that (we did the same thing at Times Square Sheraton previous year). Were told at LPM front desk we couldn't have three to the room and were basically told we needed a rollaway at $50/night. Rollaway came late (near 11 pm) the first night and was OK/typical rollaway. We did get upgraded to a Deluxe (nice room), but the king bed isn't Sweet Sleeper Sheraton material; not much to it (hard mattress) and didn't sleep well. Room was drafty but there were no temperature controls. Burger Joint is crowded but is a gem with great burgers and reasonable Sam Adams pitchers if you can find a seat. Friendly baggage handlers and doormen and front desk people polite but don't have much clout in upgrading (I've never have been charged extra at a Sheraton property before). Don't understand the concept of an \"upgrade\" with extra charges (seems counterproductive), and I read a number of posts on TripAdvisor that noted that SPG Gold members are upgraded routinely. No newspapers or free Internet, which easily could be offered at a room that probably sells for $500-$700/night. Stayed three nights in a junior suite. Prior to arrival, Margaret at the front desk was wonderful with reinstating my accommodations when Starwood's customer service messed up my reservation. Check in was a breeze. You do have to walk through Knave, the hotel bar, if you enter from 57th street, but if you take the 56th street entrance you go right to the front desk. The lobby area was always bustling during our stay, but it was quiet up on our floor. My ten year old loved the cartoons in the elevator and the roof top pool. The views from both the pool and attached outdoor sun deck are beautiful. Our junior suite was very spacious and both the bedroom bed and the sofa bed were comfortable. I'm a light sleeper, but was not disturbed by outdoor or hotel sounds during my stay. \\nWe had drinks and coffee at Knave. The room is beautiful and the service was good. We ate at the Burger Joint twice and it was delicious and reasonable. \\nThe location is close to multiple subway stops and just two blocks from Central Park. It was easy walking to Rockfeller Center, MoMA, Times Square, Empire State Building, and the musuems at Central Park, but I am quite a walker. If you don't walk as much, it is good to know the subway is close by.\\nWe had great meals nearby at Rue 57, just about half a block from the hotel at 57th and 6th and also at Bouchon Bakery in the Time Warner Center. \\nI would stay here again because I really liked the location. I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. Very convenient as the location is close to my NYC offices. The breakfast is particularly exceptionnal (I recommend the chestnut pancake. Loved the hotel, the location and everything about it. We had a room with 2 double beds which were comfortable. The room was spacious which I didn't really expect for New York. I would stay at this hotel again The general feel of this place is sophistication. It is in a quiet, non-touristy location, but within walking distance to all of the mid-town attractions. The lobby is nice, however, I didn't like that, to get to check-in, you have to walk through an upscale bar. It was a bit awkward to roll in my luggage beside people who were dressed up and getting ready for a night on the town. The rooms were a bit disappointing. I thought they would match the general feel of the hotel, but they don't. They are nice and clean, but small and decorated with weird (unhip) colours. Great toiletries! There is also a really cool burger restaurant on the main lobby that you must try whether you are staying here or not. It's hidden, so you may need to ask a staff member to help you find it.\\nOverall, my stay was comfortable, but I wouldn't rush back here. I'd rather stay at the Hilton which is around the corner. The rooms at the Hilton are bigger and nicer and generally less expensive. Good location central to all the NYC touristy attractions. Great hip atmosphere and not your typical standard hotel look. Rooms were quite spacious for NYC standards although I believe I was slightly upgraded as SPG gold member. I think I had deluxe room. \\nGreat lobby with good lobby bar. Burger bar in back hidden gem and great burgers. Didn't check out Normas as very expensive but heard it was great. Best thing about the hotel is the very relaxing rooftop where you get a nice view of city. Nice to just go out, grab one of their lounge chair and take a nap or read a book. A nice oasis after walking around the city all day. Also carnegie deli nearby. As an added note, if you don't valet and self park, I believe it is cheaper (around 25-30 dollars) look for coupons on the internet for NYC parking. Stayed here on a business trip. Room in excellent condition despite older age of hotel. Gorgeous view of central park to the north. Super convenient and quiet. Strangely TV was old, but picture was ok. I imagine they are updating those in a cycle. Check in was prompt and staff was very attentive. Would absolutely return. My husband and I stayed at the Parker Le Meridien for a wedding weekend in late August. While we usually stay at a Marriott in NYC, we were very pleased with our experience, The staff was very helpful, offering us late checkout on Sunday at no additional charge. Brunch at Norma's was scrumptious....although quite busy. I think it is deserving of its reputation for \"best brunch in New York. While the rooms are small, they have interesting modern decor. We did feel, however, that the halls were a little too dark and somber. We checked out the rooftop pool which has a great view, but again, is on the smallish side. We do realize though that having a pool at all in NYC is a bonus. The hotel was very convenient to the subway and had entrances on 2 blocks which was helpful. We recommend this hotel and will revisit. Stayed for a wedding weekend. Great location, near multiple subway lines to get around and in the center of town and an easy taxi to most parts of the city. \\nStaff is friendly and attentive. Excellent spot for a burger and fantastic restaurant located in the lobby. \\nThe pool could be a little better but it has an amazing view of Central Park. Would love to stay there again! It's a superb hotel with good staff, a great burger joint and bar all downstairs, swimming pool on the roof and based neatly between 5th, Central Park and Times Square.\\nI had asked for and received a Park View room, overlooking the park obviously and although the hotel was busy in my two weeks there (fashion week then UN week) it never felt rushed or crowded. Colleague staying in other hotel was impressed with room! In conjunction with Phillip Morris and the 7-up Brooklyn Bottling Company Inc., \\nmany funcitons were held at your hotel over the years. I am in love with your hotel. I recently moved back to New York from San Diego, and I now have the time to rekindle the flame with your hotel. Everyone worked hard to greet you, remember you, and make you feel at home. Thank you for the peaceful and quiet accommodations. The pool area is marvelous. Everything is well thought out and maintained. As an author, I travel extensively and appreciate excellence in management. Bravo!\\nProblems you asked? Absolutely not! First of all, I should highlight that the purpose of my trip was to celebrate being with my girlfriend for a year and so wanted to propose whilst in New York. So I wanted somewhere that would be well located and be lush enough to make my girlfriend have the New York WOW factor.\\nMy experience started with a very friendly and very efficient check-in (just what we needed after a 10hr trip!) and when walking around to the separate luxury lifts I knew we were on to a winner!! We got the lift to the top floor where there are rooms (41st) and even walking out into the lift lobby Claire and I could see how amazing our room view was going to be!\\nOn entering our room we had some complementary treats but the really lovely thing was a card and poem from Lisa Tharp of guest relations whom I had emailed just prior to going. I had already paid for an upgraded room to have a park view but the little touches Lisa had put in place really made a difference and for that I am very very grateful.\\nOur room - 4105\\nOk so the view WAS AMAZING - ALL of central park the trump tower etc. on clear view.\\nThere was a coat room area with iron, safe and umbrella - though luckily for us was gorgeous sunshine Sat 2nd and Sun 3rd of October :)\\nThere was a pleasant seat, desk and the note to say what was on and details of the events in New York and restaurants details etc. were perfect. The swivelling TV unit was cool as it enabled snuggles in the morning and the bed was perfect for me and my now fiancee who are both over 6ft tall! \\nEverything you'd expect from a bathroom was there and was well lit for getting ready for a night out!\\nWe went to Knave for cocktails, which were sublime and got us in the mood for our dinner out in the city later.\\nNorma's for breakfast, which really showed why it consistently gets voted best brekkie in NY. My buckwheat gallettes filled with emmenthal, ham and topped with poached egg were divine and despite the price being $70 for two breakfasts was very good value!\\nSince I read about the Burger Joint in Heston Blumenthal's book I have wanted to go here so when I saw it was in my hotel I was the happiest guy! I like my fine food but the burgers in there were nothing less than fantastic. The burger meat is cooked to taste which means (as a European- this is what you want) I had a rare cooked burger and the bun was so thin and crisp the moisture of meat made it taste like packaged up goodness in parcel! \\nFlawless from start to finish and could not recommend this hotel more - thanks again Lisa,\\nJohn My fiance and I spent two wonderful nights at the Le Parker Meridian in September 2010. The service was top notch from check-in, where we received a listing of \"happenings\" in NYC that prompted us to go to the San Genarro festival on the spur of the moment, to the concierge who helped us with nice dinner reservations. Norma's for breakfast is not to be missed - a top rated eatery that lives up to its billing! The location is close to the Theatre District and Central Park and is only a block away from a convenient subway station. We will definitely come back to spend more time at Le Parker Meridian! The strengths of this hotel are its location, its staff and its very serviceable room. It is located a short walk to times square and is a great location if your business takes you to midtown. If you have a few minutes you can easily get to Central Park, midtown shopping, and theatre. The room itself is spiffy and efficient and fairly roomy. I had a junior suite that was indeed pretty \"junior\" but it was reasonably comfortable:Modern, with a good desk set up, an aeron chair a cool looking entertainment center with plasma tv that rotates on a stylish axis -- so you can watch tv from the living area or from the bed. I think the best hting at the hotel is a pool, beautifully situated with amazing views and open for long hours. I loved it. The bed was comfortable with good quality linens and the bathroom was very nice. The shower was, again very stylish, though there was no tub. My one quarrel with the bathroom (talk about nitpicking but it bugged me) was that there was no way to turn the shower on without standing directly under the water stream, ie. no way to avoid that rush of cold water while you are adjusting the temperature. See I told you it was nitpicking. More importantly, I didn't much care for the room service -- again lovely people but the menu was limited and extremely expensive, even for New York. Also, the a la carte breakfast menu was so limited that a bowl of berries and two poached eggs would have cost $60, just because I couldn't seem to persuade them to shed the potatoes and meat I didn't want. Now there is no such thing as a good deal on a room service breakfast in New York, but this was one of the most outlandish I have encountered. \\nThe staff was just lovely, from room service to the concierge to the fellow at front desk trying to deal with the one thing that was truly, truly annoying: the high speed internet. It has to be the highest priced daily cost I have ever seen in the city (including much better hotels), and it worked poorly. Sadly, the internet service is outsourced to a company that further outsources its help desk. The hotel staff was powerless to remove the charge. He tried valiently to deal with the the outsourcer's outsourcer, but it was just impossible. They had an incomprehensible series of steps to take and codes to remember if i wanted to \"prove\" that the service didn't work. It was truly ridiculous and in the end, of course, not worth it. The front desk guy was truly chagrined. But if you are traveling on business decent wireless matters, and this was unacceptable. while I can't say I will never go back, I can say that I will probably avoid the hotel if other choices are available. Stayed the week of September 20th and I will try to give future guests an unbiased view....\\nLet's start with the positives: Staff was extremely courteous and accomodating. Never could I pass a staff member wothout a cheerful and enthusiastic hello. Several orders from room service were delivered on time and fresh and location is hard to beat. Close to Central Park (3 blocks) and many other main NY hotspots. Rooms were clean and housekeeping kept them tidy all week. We had a room on the 25th floor and while the view towards CP is nice, I feel you need to be up at least on 30 or higher to fully appreciate. We were in deluxe room and while not large it certainly did'nt feel claustrophobic. Now for the \"opportunities: Bring cash, lot's of cash. At a discounted corporate rate our room was $439 plus about $70 in tax. Norma's and anything on room service menu is going to be $$$$. But, hey this is NY. Rooms are getting a little \"tired\" . What was chic in 1995 is just looking old now. Old style TV with poor reception and out of date clocks/phones/lamps, etc. Once again, room was clean and that is most important, but if Le Parker would do some minor updating they could play with the \"big boys\". While at $500+ night I feel that Le Parker slightly misses the mark in the higher end hotel, it makes up for it's misses with excellent customer service and location. I stayed in this hotel for 1 week on june 2010.\\nThe hotel is very confortable and the position is excellent.\\nI met often business man customers.\\nThe best rooms are on the uppers floor (with a great view).\\nThe swimming pool on the top floor is fantastic.\\nInside the lobby there's a typical burger house. I stayed here for me and my fiance's birthday celebration. I used 4800 points and I spent another $106 on the hotel, and I gave a charitable donation to Norma's, New York's most overpriced and overrated breakfast experience. This also doesn't relfect the fact that I had a very very disappointing experience at your hotel. I live in Los Angeles, and I was visiting my Fiance in Philadelphia and this was supposed to be a very very special dual birthday celebration. I believe that it is in the public interest to know what people dont see from the pictures - a very expensive best western. \\nStaying at a nice hotel in NYC is supposed to be a wonderful and magical experience. I had many different luxury hotels to choose from, both Starwoods and not, and I am still so dissappointed that I choose Le Parker Meridien. I wish I could go back in time and choose one of the W's or something, but I can't. I have stayed at Meridien's before and they are usually very nice... this one needs to be gutted and updated. \\nThe TV buzzed loudly - when I called they sent and engineer who didnt speak any english and he stood and stared at the tv and told me he didnt know what he could do. He should have switched our room or replaced the tv... \\nThe mattress is thin and old - nothing heavenly about this bed. \\nLamp was broken.\\nSoap dish broken.\\nPopcorn ceilings. \\nGross! I would not recommend this to anyone. Stay somewhere else. \\nWhen I reported my dissatisfaction, they offered a nominal amount of points and told me the case was closed... Stunning hotel with a boutique feel. Bathroom is AMAZING. Huge, with giant walk in slate shower. We got the deluxe suite. Love the Burger Joint downstairs and location is pretty good, but all the cool places to eat and go out at night are a train or cab ride away. When me and my girlfriend first arrived at this hotel, we was blown away! I honestly felt a little out of place that it might be too posh for us!\\nWe made it to the desk an hour before check-in and the desk advised us to have a stroll round central park and they would get us a room with a view. . . We ended up on the top floor with and amazing city view!\\nAll week the staff helped us with anything we needed, the roof top pool was amazing, my girlfriend spent along time in there.\\nOnly downside is i would of rather of paid for the room up front than wait till later. I was told the hotel would \"freeze\" the money so i couldn't spend it but i spoke with my bank and it wasn't possible. That was the only down side for me.\\nIf we ever come back to New York we will come back here. Thank you. $450 rooms but charge you $20 for a toothbrush and paste.....drugstore is 1.5 blocks away. But that sums it up. \\nListen, rooms are small.....but that's Manhattan. The lobby is crowded, no carpet, lack expansive feeling, but that's Manhattan. Location is excellent -- near major subways right near CP, FAO Schwartz, 5th Avenue shopping, Broadway, restaurants. View of CP is actually quite good. Pool is nice, but small. \\nStaff was excellent. Hotel is quiet. Not too great for kids though. \\nBasically, would give it 4-stars if it was $300/nt, but it's not. It wants to play with the big boys because it has a \"park view\" rooms -- which it does, although another street (of mostly shorter) buildings blocks your view from directly overlooking CP. \\nI could see it being a good business hotel. But, you sort of wish the lobby was grander and less crowded -- not a real \"comforting\" place to return to lobbywise. I've stayed at the Waldorf a couple years ago and that place felt magical. \\nThe thing that irked me though was after a rough slog quickly packing and getting into the city, realized I forget my toothbrush, asked to have a complimentary one and was told that it and the paste would be $20. \\nI know it's a \"business hotel\" and it's the banker who stays here normally gets to \"write off\" that money as a business expense (not only do they get bailouts, they get subsidized $20 toothbrushes) but it was the weekend and tourists were responsible for the guests, perhaps they could change the policy then? \\nNote to great staff otherwise Undercut management and make some cash. Go to the drugstore 1.5 blocks away, get the toothpaste and brush, return and charge $12. You;ll see profits about $8-9 -- but more importantly you'll give off the feeling that you go the extra for the customer also. It served its purpose for a conference... nice modern rooms with a decent view. Hotel staff were adequate with concerns and addressed them in a timely fashion. Travelling with two adults and two teenagers while visiting local art schools. Stayed 3 nights in an upgraded suite and a double on the same high floor. A/C worked well during 90 plus degree weather, and rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. Thankfully No Bugs, although a nearby theater was closed during our visit due to those nasty bed bugs...front page of Daily News had a huge article on NYC bedbug outbreak during our stay so we were thankful we stayed at the Parker. \\nDouble facing Central Park had a great view. Old school big tube TVs and NO FREE WIRELESS INTERNET access were a big disappointment for everyone...(c'mon management, it's a new millenium...I Pads and HD flat screens should be standard everywhere by now in a hotel of this class)...but otherwise rooms were typical size and layout for NYC. \\nENCLOSED ROOF TOP POOL was open (although stifling in the heat and humidity) and kids didn't want to use it, but we loved having access to the outdoor roof...views are good, there's lots of rubble and some areas are closed off and in disrepair, but still a nice perk for midtown--but they close the rooftop access early so you can't sneak up to take in the nighttime views.\\nAll in all, we enjoyed our stay and weren't bothered at all by the press and Jonas Brothers/Camp Rock folks holding interviews while we were there...but for the herd of black Denali Limos parked out front, you'd never know any teen idols were in the hotel...someone was doing a GREAT JOB there...\\nI like this hotel, and I hope management continues to repair and improve this property so it will be here when my children come to visit with their families.\\nPrices are comparable to nearby higher end properties...so it's still worth the price of admission to stay at the Parker. My most disappointing stay in the past two years at any Starwood Hotel as a Starwood Platinum. I have no interest in taking any further time here to spell out my disappointment, as I firmly believe management at this hotel truly wouldn't care anyway. But, I will try to take the time to email the President of Starwood and/or the head of N. American operations in the near future to discuss my stay here and, hopefully, that might lead to some significant changes at this hotel and the way they treat all guests, including Platinums. Booked a last minute trip over the phone for a saturday night. I mentioned that I was bringing two dogs as I found out they were pet friendly. So the reservation was complete and I went ahead and paid the \"pay now and save\" option. We checked in and somehow got an upgrade to a Junior Suite from Deluxe room...very nice. Since I already told them about my dogs, I wsn't aware that I had to register my dogs. Our suite was nice and had the right plan/idea. workmanship/craftsmanship was just a little weak.\\nWent out for dinner, but had to cut it short...got a call from the hotel saying that my dogs were barking like crazy (oops!) Ran back to the hotel to find out that the security guy was at the door and he was pissed...made it sound like we snuck the dogs in. BTW, my dogs were right next to me as we were checking in. \\nAnywho, I went to the front desk and \"registered\" my dogs. $50 per pet is very affordable. What annoyed me was the fact that one of the front desk (female) employees whispered loudly to the gentleman who was helpling me \"...I can't believe they did this, it's $50 per pet, and that's a hundred dollars\". But I wasn't going to open my mouth and start anything since we were at fault :-) besides I was tired and already had a few drinks and didn't need any hoopla. I just stood there pretended that I didn't hear anything. Then the gentleman very politely gave me the paperwork and nicely asked me to not leave the dogs in the rooms by themselves. Done.\\nCheck out was a breeze. Somehow someone ordered breakfast and put it on our tab...they took care of the error immediately.\\nI like the 12:00 PM checkout. \\nI would definitely stay here again, but I first need to try out the other pet friendly places... Hotel Penn, Marriott Marquis, 70 Park Avenue etc etc. We had the best time staying at the Parker Meridien, the location was in walking distance to the theatre at night, museums during the day and dinner at the Time Warner bldg. The food at Norma's is not to be believed, and the bar at night as well as coffee served there during the day was exceptional. I cannot wait to book my next visit and stay there! The Parker offered everything we were looking for in a NYC hotel.\\nWe were one of 5 couples who stayed at the hotel in order to have a true NYC experience. All of us were delighted with the service, food and overall ambience if the hotel.\\nThanks for a terrific time! This hotel was close to midtown and Times Square, on a quiet street between 6th & 7th Avenues.\\nThe rooms were modern and comfortable. It being NYC, of course they were overpriced.\\nThe front desk/lobby were extremely under-staffed, with a long wait to check in and check/retrieve luggage - unacceptable for a large and pricey hotel. The people working there were reasonably friendly (by NYC standards).\\nThe burger place off the lobby is high quality, basic and affordable cuisine - thumbs up! I have been traveling from Boston to NYC on business regularly, for the last 10 years. I have stayed in hotels that rank from the best to the worst. The high-speed internet company I work for watches every penny we spend. This hotel is by far one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The service is outstanding, the rooms are impeccable and the location is perfect. It's comfortable, safe and a great value for the money. Decided to head down to the city for a quick trip for my birthday with my girlfriend. Got in touch with Lisa from Guest Relations to see if she could help me with a room with a great view of Central Park...ended up on the 41st floor (highest you can go). The view was worth every penny and will have me coming back to this hotel time and time again. Thank you so much Lisa! The front desk and bellmen were also very nice and helpful in our visit with really no wait for service. The hotel itself was everything I expected of it and more, with a beautiful lobby and nicely appointed rooms. I also enjoyed Burger Joint, it's quite unique for being in a hotel like Le Parker Meridien. The location of the hotel is perfect as it's within a half block of 2 subway lines and walking distance to 5th Ave. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel and will be back again. We chose Le Parker Meridien, because it was recommended by Fodor's as \"family friendly\". The only thing family friendly was a coloring book handed out at check-in and a television showing cartoons in the elevator, which didn't impress my son. We wanted a luxury hotel close to Central Park, and this hotel was very convenient for walking to the park. We were told we were being upgraded to a very special room. We stayed in room 2921. I don't know what the standard rooms were like, but this room did not seem like an upgraded room. The room was very quiet, and the bed was comfortable, but the room was dusty. We heard great things about the Burger Joint, but never got to try it. While waiting in line to place our order, guests from the back of the line came in and took all the empty tables prior to ordering their food. When we mentioned this to the man behind the counter, his response was he just worked there and couldn't get involved. We had our 19 month old son with us, so we left. We went to Angelo's Coal Oven Pizzeria across the street and had delicious pizza and fried calamari. Norma's breakfast was very good and expensive. They provide high chairs and booster seats, but we didn't feel the restaurant was a good choice for small children. The staff was accommodating, but not very friendly. The front desk staff however, were exceptionally friendly. We visited FAO Schwartz, which was a few blocks away. They have men dressed as toy soldiers roll out a red carpet and play a bugle to announce the store is open. The employees line up inside and clap as you enter the store. That was special for the kids. Le Parker Meridien was an average hotel. For the price we paid, there are better options for our next visit to New York. You might have heard the words \"a home away from home\" ? Anyway it is one way to describe how we value our stay at Le Parker Meridien New York.\\nFrom a general point of view: Excellent location (of course, it was one of the main reasons for us to select Le Parker Meridien), with a GREAT VIEW from our room !\\nIn particular: This trip, which was only a 5 night trip, was to celebrate our 1-year anniversary as a married couple. For us a very special moment.\\nJust prior to our arrival I made contact to ms Lisa Tharp (Guest Relation Manager) to get some foam pillows for my wife - which we did get of course (more than we expected actually - this was greate service!). I also happened to mention our anniversary for ms Lisa Tharp, so we also got a surprise in our room: Chocolate dropped strawberry's which was such a great surprise !! Oboy my wife and I really like them :-)\\nBut what made all the difference for us, was ms Lisa Tharp's biggest surprise in setting us up in room 4009 on 40th floor.\\nYes we did order a park view room (that was about all I could control when American Express did the reservation), and we kindly asked for a high floor room with view over Central Park (which we totally love).\\nHowever we could never imagine to get this high up, and with such a great room - and man did we like that view !!! I could easily go on and on about the view.... We did have some jetlag and woke up at 3 in the morning, and just watching out that window over Central Park made our day - every day !!! I wish somewhere in my heart that we one day might move to New York and get a chance to live with that view each day!\\nAnyway, we had a great stay, we loved the burger joint, and most of all:\\nWe totally loved Le Parker Meridien and the very good help from Le Parker Meridien staff, and in particular ms Lisa Tharp. We will return, you can count on that !! We were looking forward to a great hotel in a great location, but were very disappointed. Our printed reservation said that we had a king room connected to two double beds. As we have four children, we needed the second room to allow for the kids to share. Upon arrival, when we looked at the second room, there were two twins, not doubles. I called down to reception and the person at the other line could care less about my dilemma. He said he could send up a cot that would have to go in my room as the other room could only accomodate two people. Not only that, the cot charge was $50 per night! There was no \"Sorry mam\" for the confusion on the reservation and no attempt to accomodate us by reducing or waving the charge for the cot.\\nWhen it came time to get a cab out front, the doorman was snooty and outright ignored us! I had to go inside to ask about getting a taxi and someone inside had to come out and ask him again!\\nWe had wanted to take our children down for breakfast one morning, and called the front desk the night before to ensure that there was a children's menu available. We were told of course. So, we head down the next morning, and guess what? NO children's menu for any meals there!!! So frustrating and I was not spending $25 on pancakes for my kids! Found a great place - Teleon Cafe- up the street on the opposite side that had breakfasts for $5 for the kids. Food and service was great there!\\nIn addition to the above, the fire detector in our room buzzed all night as the battery had not been replaced, and the safe in our room was locked and therefore could not be used. We mentioned all of the above to the front desk manager who didn't seem to care very much. \\nOverall, poor service and definitely not value for the money. Looks like a nice hotel, but looks deceived us in this case. I love this hotel. There is so much thought put into every little detail and you will enjoy your experience here guaranteed. The rooms are well-designed and many have great views. Comfortable beds and wonderful restaurants (Norma's has amazing brunch, Nave amazing coffee, and Burger Joint amazing burgers) in the midst of Midtown. Just fantastic! I got this room after I bid in Priceline, the location is great. Close to central park, 5th ave, Time square and a lot of restaurant.... The hotel is decorate like \"Ikea style but the lobby area is very stylish and elegant compare withe the decoration in the rooms. The rooms very tiny, beds very confortable but tiny. I request two bed for my family of 3, my and my husband does not fit in one bed. I ended sleep with my daughter. The room very clean and service ies great. My spouse and I needed a romantic getaway weekend in NY and after considering several hotel options, decided on 2 nights at Le Parker Meridian. We definitely made the right choice! We used starpoints for one of the nights. Check in was smooth, the lobby is very elegant and the staff pleasant. We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite. There was a bedroom with king size bed, plenty of closet space (by the way, the closet curtains are of a beautiful velvet material, not cheesy at all), a living room area with couch, desk, table and minibar and a decent size bathroom. Our tub was a typical bathtub shower combo but the water pressure was amazing. We took 2 showers a day just for the experience. Our friends had a suite on another level with a more modern glass enclosed shower but complained they had poor water pressure. Our air conditioning was perfect, not noisy at all. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in and the sheets and bedding were perfect. It was the best night sleep I have gotten in a long time. Housekeeping was very good, the room was very clean. There is a nice indoor pool on the rooftop with outdoor sunning option. Nice view of Central Park. There is an elegant bar near the lobby where we had a drink with friends the first evening. The drinks were good but $18 for a drink is expensive, even by NY standards. I didn't like the entrance to the Burger Joint on the main floor. It was hard to find the entrance and it was surrounded by huge curtains. There were long lines some of the time and the space was very small. With so many dining options in the area, we decided it wasn't worth the wait. Central Park is about 2 1/2 blocks away. The weather was perfect for a stroll in the park and, boy, did I get a workout, but worth every minute. Central Park is probably the best park I know. Go on a sunny day so you can enjoy the many talented street musicians throughout the park. Carnegie Hall is about a block away and Times square is a short walk away. I loved that we were able to enjoy Times square and come back to a quiet place as Times Square can be overwhelming. Taxis are always waiting in front of the hotel so if you don't want to walk somewhere, you can pick one up conveniently. We wanted to see a comedy show so we called the Concierge ahead of time and they recommended Caroline's Comedy Club which was about 4 blocks away. This was a good recommendation. We did not try Norma's but hear they have a very good, but expensive, breakfast. Overall, our goal of a romantic weekend was met thanks to NYC and Le Parker Meridian. We can't wait to come back! It is an old hotel, built in 1981 according to nice bellboy who said he has been working there since opening. Had a renewed bathroom , but the room looked definitely like a cheap second class hotel. I was thinking that anyway the staff is friendly they are making it up, but then during the check out I met that guy -Lawrence- who works at the reception but thinks he owns the whole building. When asked to print the invoice with company title he answers: \" let me see if i can do it or not ? When I told him I want to get the adaptor and I want to be charged for it because i need it , he insisted that i cannot :) for 3 times. It took 3 minutes to let him go and ask manager and come back with an 'oh you can yes\" . Then he printed the invoice and put it on the desk like 'take it and leave' manner . I asked for an envelope then he had a deep breath and this time he put the envelope in the same manner on the desk. It was enought then I called for the FD manager and complained. Has it worked? I don't know , but you will see if you go there:) Would I go there again or recommend? No for sure. Great hotel in great position. Small pool but good to come back to. Breakfast deserves its reputation but VERY expensive. Fantastic burger bar hiding behind the curtain in the foyer- very cheap. Just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay at the Parker Meridien. We had 2 rooms on the 9th floor. We choose the hotel for the location. It is walking distance to Central Park & Times Square. Our check-in went very smoothly. The young lady at the front desk was very pleasant, friendly & funny! She quickly sized us up & recommended a very nice bar nearby with a fantastic \"Happy Hour\"! The rooms were larger than expected for NYC and very clean and pleasant. There wasn't much drawer space, but the 'closet', had some shelves that we used. It was actually just a rod & shelving behind a curtain. The bathroom was a little small and there is not much counterspace for toiletries, but it was beautiful. The hotel provided toiletries were wonderful. My roommate & I fought over who got to take them home! We didn't eat at either restaurant, but they seemed to be popular. We did visit the lounge for some delicious, but very expensive, cocktails. The service here was wonderful. Bartenders spoke to us everytime we walked through, even if we didn't sit & order drinks. Waitstaff was quick to make recommendations too. The rooftop pool was small but very nice, clean area, again friendly staff. The views from the rooftop terrace were amazing! The lobby felt very safe, room cards were checked when we returned late at night. The guy at the front desk was very funny, jokingly expressing the concern of a father when we came 'home' in the wee hours of the morning! The concierge was very helpful with suggestions & reservations. All in all, the Parker made my first visit to NYC very enjoyable! I would gladly return & will recommend to others! Our two night stay at the Meridien, located on West 56th street, 3 blocks south of Central Park, was more than perfect. We were upgraded to a room on the 32nd floor which afforded us a gorgeous view of the park. The hotel is a short walk to Times Square but away from the maddening crowd. Our room was tastefully decorated to maximize its space and create an open and modern feel. The bathroom is generous by new york standards and well appointed. We visited the lobby bar which was fun and relaxing and they accommodate tea totalers such as myself! I loved the nut bowl which accompanies your order! And, you must have breakfast/brunch at Normas, located off the lobby. It was simply the most yummy breakfast ever--not cheap--but worth every penny! Our server was divine--attentive and cheery. \"Come hungry, darling\"--the portions are humungous and to die for! My family and I traveled to New York to be interviewed by CBS about our buffalo attack. I was completely miserable as I was suffering a serious hematoma in my leg. I was not impressed with New York itself under the circumstances, but I loved this hotel. It was truly the best part of my trip. After the interview, all I wanted to do was get back to the hotel, order room service and rest. I did just that. The room was beautful, the food was better than homemade, the bed was comfortable and I ordered a movie, and was in heaven. Everybody was so kind and considerate. What I saw of the facilities was beautiful, though I couldn't swim or workout, it would have been a dream to be able to do it with such an incredible view of the city. Overall the stay was wonderful. I was in NYC for the NYC Triathlon. When I was scheduled to check in the room wa sall ready for me. The lady in the front saw I had two kids and knew the room I had requested wasn't really the right size for my family. She worked with me on getting an upgrade. And when the new room wasn't ready yet they took care of all my stuff (luggage, golf clubs, Triathlon bike, etc) and I was able to enjoy the city with the family for a bit. The room was fantastic. The kids loved it. And although its a upscale type of place the staff was down to earth and very freindly. Even the elevators were giving Popeye cartoons when we went up. Fun for the kids as well as my wife and I as it brought back memories of our childhood. My wife and I stayed at the Parker Sept. 2006. The modern hotel was prefectly located for access to Central Park and surrounding attractions. The modern rooms were spacious and offered good views. Check in was easy and the staff was agreeable. There was nothing that overwhelmed me about this hotel but if you want a hotel close to Central Park at a decent value then pick the Le Parker Meridien. Traveled with a family from Germany, including 8 and 12 year old boys, and all the staff, especially concierge and registration desks, were terrific in their advice about what to do, what to avoid, and how to make visiting the boys' top 10 list as painless as possible. Considering that this was high tourist season and unusually hot for NYC, that was a tough assignment: how to avoid long lines and still cover the big deals, including Broadway, Statue of Liberty, Museum of Natural History, State Island Ferry, Central Park etc.\\nAs a former (but forever) New Yorker, i was most impressed that when we managed to lose the 8 year old, they helped us find him without making the parents feel that they should be turned over to social welfare officials!\\nThe hotel itself has everything --location, views, child-friendly restaurants, pool--that a family is looking for, but the staff make the difference between this place and another hotel with the same features. I booked a night at the Parker Meridien using priceline, and then went to the tripadvisor site to check out the reviews. What I read concerned me: there were many complaints about poor air conditioning, snooty service and questionable cleanliness.\\nFortunately none of those issues pertained to our stay. The check-in clerk was extremely nice and gave us a beautiful room on a high floor (even though we had scored a cheap rate through priceline.) The room was updated, immaculately clean and in perfect condition. Loved the flat-screen TV on the rotating pedestal. And it was definitely spacious for a New York City room. The weather that day was stiflingly muggy and the air conditioning worked great. (While it is true that you cannot adjust the temperature, the front desk gave us instructions on how to activate the fan.)\\nThe location can't be beat: two blocks from Central Park and walking distance to the Broadway district. Lots of great restaurants in the area as well. One caveat: Any \"extras\" are extremely expensive, so be very careful before you run up any guest charges. No need to dine at the hotel, as there are plenty of reasonably-priced options nearby. All in all, a perfect stay. THe conceriege gave us wonderful suggestions for dinner for both nights of our stay. Our front desk clerk took care of our reservations for the off site restaurants and for Normas (the in house restaurant we went for brunch). All of the restaurant suggestions were superb (I highly recommend The Rouge Tomate. Normas was excellent, but they don't serve mimosas or bloody mary's :( And, the burger bar was delicious!!\\nOur rooms were spacious and comfortable. The bathrooms were very spacious. I locked myself out of my room and the security were very patient and understanding. \\nThe only complaint I have is about the \"spa\" services. THe spa shouldn't even be considered a spa. It consists of two tiny little rooms with tiled floors (that have drainage holes in the middle of them for some reason.) Oh, and the bathroom is like a storage room where all kinds of junk is stored. So the spa like experience is diminished as soon as you have to pee before you get on the table. \\nThe facialist was nice enough, but there was no music and so it felt very clinical (the ipod dock was broken). The massage was the worse I had ever received. The guy was extremely sweaty and said some things that I thoguht were inappropriate. Nothing \"happened\", but the comments were enough to make me not go back. I just want to lay down and be peaceful, get a massage and go home. Is that so hard? I'd never go back to him. I might go back for the facial if there was music because I liked the way my skin and my boyfriend's skin look/felt afterwards. Check-in was quick and friendly. Location was wonderful, close to Central Park, Broadway, Radio City, and Times Square. The Burger Joint was delicious,but, very crowded. We had to eat in our room, as there was no where to sit. The room was comfortable. the bathroom has a great shower. The roof top deck was the best. The view of Central Park was wonderful. Everyone that works at the hotel, that we came in contact with was friendly, and had a smile. I took my 9 year old daughter to New York for a fun weekend. After a fun day of sight seeing and shopping we got back to our room and pulled back the bed spread. There was feces on the comforter, no kidding, it looked like someone had used it for toilet paper! I covered it up and shared the other bed with my daughter. It was too late to make a big deal, and I didn't want to do that in front of my daughter. The next morning when we checked out I made mention of to make sure the comforter was cleaned for the next guest. The desk person was horrified, and called the manager up and she was horrified also and offered her apology, and an up grade for our next visit. I guess she tried something, not much, but there are hundreds of hotels in NY I don't know why we would come back to this one. I travel a lot, never has anything like this happened. What kind of a cleaning policy does this place have that would allow this to happen? I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for two nights recently and have to say I am very surprised by some of the negative reviews the hotel has gotten. Some reviewers mention rude staff. All the staff I met was very friendly, from the check-in staff that was able to check us in early to the concierge that was very helpful. The location of the hotel could not be better. The one downside was, as some other reviewers also mentioned, that the AC in the room wasn’t all that powerful and you can’t change the temperature yourself. However overall, it was a very pleasant stay. We stayed at the Parker Meridien for 5 nights in June. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!! We upgraded to a high floor room with a view of Central Park. $50 extra per night. The view was great. And here's where the rest goes downhill:\\n1) The last night we were there I realized my nightgown was missing. I called security & filed a report with lost & found. By the time we checked out the following afternoon they still hadn't found it. When I talked with the front desk clerk I told her that the gentleman from security was friendly on the phone. She responded, \"That's because he's new here. Ha ha ha!\" Then she referred me to Andrew for further assistance. Andrew informed me that they had 90 days to find the nightgown. I asked him if at the end of the 90 day period they would compensate me for the lost nightgown. He immediately responded, \"Oh no! We don't have to give you anything!\" I asked him what the point of the 90 day period was. He had no idea. That was a super way to thank a Starwood Preferred guest for the 5 night stay. Since I left I've called the hotel 4 times. Every time I speak to someone different (thankfully not Andrew!) & no one knows what I'm talking about & then they tell me the nightgown hasn't turned up.\\n2) Our upgraded room's air conditioning didn't work. The first night we were fine. The second night all three of us - including our 9 year old - were so hot we could only sleep with a sheet. The thermostat indicated that if you want to change the temperature in the room you have to call engineering. We called the next day & the individual who came to the room told us that the air conditioning was not broken & then turned the thermostat down to 64.5 degrees. It remained there for the rest of the stay, and we perspired our way through each night. One day I ran into a hotel employee who wasn't very friendly. She quickly apologized & said that it was just so hot in the hotel, she was having a hard time keeping her composure. I told her about the air conditioning in our room & she replied, \"That's unacceptable. You must complain.\" We did. Nothing changed.\\n3) Several of the channels on the TV didn't work. Other guests on our floor asked us if we were having the same problem. Occasionally if you waited a while the program would appear, but this trick didn't always work.\\nThe staff in the bar were the nicest we met in the entire hotel. Despite being an actually nice hotel with great rooms, great placement and good prices... \\nI have to say a HUGE thumbs down. Le Parker has sent my email address and then sent a bunch of spam to me advertising their sister hotel in Palm Springs. I stay at Starwood hotels around the world... always top tier, and never in my life has a hotel exercised such amazingly bad judgment. \\nhttp://www.flyertalk.com/forum/starwood-preferred-guest/1102863-weird-mrs-p-we-believe-parker-meridien-spam-vertical-response.html#post14262096\\nI would not recommend this hotel to anyone until they clearly confess to their sins and fix this problem of massive consumer confidence and privacy!\\nP Have stayed here many times and each time was satisfying. The room prices have always been very competative for NYC. Central location is perfect for business and leisure. On the lucky occasion of getting a park view room the stay becomes very special. I stayed in the hotel for a week with my hubby who was in NY on business. The hotel is clean inside and out. The room (20th floor) was very spacious, king-size bed, with a TV, separate bathroom, sofa with a small table, desk and chair and room to hang clothes. The view from the hotel was ok, as with most hotels in this area, I think you will only get a view of another hotel and the tops of the trees from central park. The hotel is in great location, it has everything in walking distance. I would recommend you print a map from their website which I found really useful to plan my day or check where I was! The hotel is quite pricey if you use their other services, laundry, internet $16per day, room service etc. I wouldn’t recommend eating from here as there are so many cool and cheap places to eat around this hotel! The staff were really nice and helpful. We stayed for a weekend vacation in June 2010. The suite was clean, comfortable, and spacious for a NYC hotel. The location can't be beat. (Be sure to check out the burger joint in the lobby, and the rooftop pool is nice.)\\nHowever, upon check-in to our room we discovered a malfunctioning safe, a shower that wasn't working properly, and a disconnected TV. All were fixed, but they took some time. Then, on checkout we went to the bell captain who refused to get my car unless I went back up to the room and called him. Finally, as I walked out the door with my bags, I watched my car drive away. For the price, hiccups like this should not happen.\\nDespite this, I would likely return. Hopefully the kinks will be ironed out next time. We stayed at the Le Parker Meridien in June 2010 for 1 night. We used points for this stay and had even increased our points by 2500 to stay in a larger upgraded room with 2 double beds. When we checked in they told us that we had two twins and were offered a king. We told them we had upgraded the room and she rudely said-- only to a view room (which by the way was a sliver of the tree tops of central park). She said they were full and offered a king room with a roll away. We took the option as that is the only thing we could do at the time. The front desk was always unhelpful and unfriendly, as I had a package delivered--and went to inquire, She said it had been sent up----with no other information....again very rude. The package was not delivered to the room as she had said and I had to call to see where it was. After that it was delivered up to the room. \\nThe beds were also very uncomfortable --definitely not the Westin heavenly beds that we had been used to! \\nThe staff Norma's (rest. in hotel) at breakfast was the only good thing about the hotel. They were amazing and went out of their way to be helpful. \\nThe bar was always full and very small. \\nI also went to the business center to print boarding passes---the lady sitting at the desk rudely asked \"what are you here for?\" I told her to print boarding passes.....she then rudely pointed and said that there was a kiosk at the front desk to use and pointed that way....she said nothing else.\\nI would not stay at this hotel again. I travel to NYC frequently for work and always try to stay at LPM. While other hotels, independent of what floor you stay on, feel like you are going to be hit by a taxi or dumptruck because they are so loud, LPM is an oasis of calm upon entering. Staff is extremely professional, friendly, and attentive without being stuffy. The rooms are large by NYC standards and views of Central Park are excellent. Headed out to New York city and stayed one night at Le Parker Meridien; what a lousy hotel. Dip into your pocket for everything...$52 US to park a motorcycle overnight (compared to free at the Embassy Suites), $2 US to make a local phone call! I asked the parking manager (parking is run by the hotel) about the cost and he said they would charge full rate for a bicycle!) If you were paying full pop at $400 a night (booked ours through Hotwire for $132) you'd be sadly dissapointed at what you get. The room is clean but the entire hotel is dated and dreary. The bed was comfortable enough so as far as getting a good night's sleep goes, it scores okay there, but the lack of rate cards made us weary of doing anything for fear of paying through the nose at check-out. The front desk staff were friendly but not outgoing (i.e. they'd help you with check-in but weren't going out of their way to help). The room we had looked onto the back of several old apartment buildings 10 feet away...like I said...if you paid full price, you'd be very disappointed. Stay elsewhere! We traveled with children ages 8 and 10 and chose the hotel because it had a pool and was close to Carnegie Hall, Central Park, Time Square and many museums. We were thrilled beyond words! The hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. It is a child-friendly hotel but would be a super place to stay if you traveled without children. \\nThe children loved the cartoons in the elevators, the beautiful pool on top of the hotel and the Wii that was projected in the racquetball court. For adults, they have a wonderful work-out facility and spa and a great location! This was our first stay in New York with 3 young children. I picked this hotel because it was recommended by a guide book as being very suitable for families (style of rooms, pool, etc.).\\nOn the family front, I think it was the right pick. The kids loved the pool and it really helped to cool down in the heat. A combination of a junior suite and adjoining room gave good space for 5. The location near the park is excellent. Staff are very helpful. Plus the children did love cartoons in the lift.\\nHowever, I wouldn't necessarily choose it for a stay without kids. Why?\\n- it's not cheap. In fairness, there aren't a lot of larger hotels in the price range (we paid about $400 per room per night). There are much better hotels for 50% more or much worse for 30% less. But, if you don't rate a pool etc, you can get better for your money\\n- it's not very clean. Checking under the bed for lost toys wasn't pleasant\\n- extras (as others have said) are extortionately priced. Internet, gym are charged.\\n- rooms are a rather tired\\nOverall, think the other reviews are accurate. It just depends on what you value.\\nOne other thing - take care to check pool opening times. It is kid-friendly but I travelled back across the city to take the kids to the pool only to discover that it was closed so that 2 elderly ladies could take an exercise class. Even the concierge didn't seem to know about the closures (which happen for an hour or two most days). My wife and I spent an anniversary weekend here and had a terrific experience. The view from our room (Central Park) was a delight. The room itself was tasteful, with high quality furnishings, and a comfortable bed. There’s a coffee shop and bar in the lobby that we really enjoyed. High ceilings, first rate coffee, good cocktails and the comings-and-goings of a well heeled, somewhat international crowd. The staff at this hotel is terrific. They all seem happy to see you and happy to be in the hotel business (not always the case in NYC). Although we didn’t have any special needs during our stay, I’m certain these people would have gone out of their way to help us, if we’d needed it. I intend to stay here again on my next business trip to NY. Got this hotel for a good rate after bidding online. Stayed on a Sunday night over Memorial Day as a staycation away from Queens. Upon checking in at 5pm, we did start feeling nickel and dimed. After asking for a late check-out, we were told there was a \"promotion\" going on, where a 2pm checkout was $25 and 5pm was $50. Standard checkout time is noon, with 1pm complimentary. Not sure how an extra hour justifies a $25 fee, but we passed on this offer.\\nKing sized room was clean and stark. Both sides of the bed had the blueish reading lights. Bathroom had decent water pressure, and lots of counter space. The breakfast menu was extremely overpriced, $28 for the standard eggs/bacon breakfast.\\nPool area was nice, a touch smaller than expected. On a holiday sunday and monday, there were lots of kids in the pool. A nice twist were the plentiful pool noodles provided. View from the rooftop was decent as well, but not quite providing the wow-factor for this native NY-er. Must've been because there were a lot of buildings between the park and the pool.\\nNorma's restaurant (at least our 5th trip here) seemed to fall a little flat compared to prior visits. The menus online were inconsistent with the ones we were given at the restaurant. However, they were pretty frequent on the free OJ refills, which should be expected for $9 a glass.\\nOverall this was a decent stay that we would return to just for the pool - although I would balk at paying their standard $269/night rates. Beautiful and clean hotel. My friend and I stayed there for 4 days and 3 nights during Memorial Day weekend. I had a wonderful time there, we were satisfied on all levels at this hotel. The staff was amazing from the second we got through the doors until the second that we left. The housekeepers were also very nice and so polite. The concierge desk was very helpful in providing us with important information on how to get around, especially Rafael who was there in the evenings. We recommend this hotel on so many levels and we were very impressed!!!!\\nThank you everyone at the Meridien Hotel. We frequently stay at Westin properties and really enjoyed our night at Le Parker Meridien. The staff were friendly and we had a pleasant suprise that we were upgraded to a superior room. Our room on the 26th floor appeared to have been recently rennovated. The bed and bedding was comfortable and soft. We both woke up relaxed from a great night's sleep.\\nUnlike other New York properties where we've stayed, we didn't have any disburbing street noise. The hotel is a couple of blocks off Central Park and a 10 block walk or $6 cab to the heart of Times Square.\\nThe hotel itself was beautifully appointed and we're still trying to figure out how the elevator made it to the 26th floor so quickly. We did peak at the rooftop swimming pool and will have to go back sometime to try it.\\nWe have a new favorite hotel in New York. I stayed at the Parker Meridien (sorry, it sounds weird to say \"le\" before English words... like \"le FDR Drive\") over a bridge weekend in NY. I hadn't stayed here before. The lobby was packed, and the hotel was completely booked, but the check-in process was efficient, if not effusive. I had booked a Jr. Suite, and the front-desk clerk told me I had been upgraded... to a Jr. Suite. I didn't understand, until I realized that there are about a dozen different room types in the hotel, and he had put me in a tower room. OK, so far so good. The room was on the small side, and no closing door between the sitting room and the bedroom (I sleep better w/ two doors between me and the hallway). The big swiveling TV / room-divider was pretty cool... in the 80s. But these are pretty minor gripes -- the room was spotlessly clean, reasonably attractive and had a really good shower.\\nI spent the weekend mostly hanging out midtown, near the hotel. I skipped the hotel breakfast -- the restaurant was jam-packed and loud -- and went to le Pain Quotidien (see, that sounds normal) on 7th and 58th. The neighborhood is great for upscale shopping, upscale eating, upscale people-watching, etc. \\nI worked out in the gym downstairs -- free for Starwood Platinum, $10 otherwise -- and this was the first nice surprise. It's a real gym -- a big one -- like the one I belong to in SF. So I could do a normal workout. I could have taken a spin class too. I also booked a massage in the spa -- great massage, nice-but-basic spa.\\nSo, a very nice experience, on the whole. Minor gripe: really-really tiny lobby bar, so I always felt like I had to go somewhere else for a drink. Also, while I know Manhattan is expensive (duh) I felt like I paid for exactly what I got -- which is fair, of course, but I guess I've gotten spoiled by getting upgraded to really nice suites with park views and still paying for a regular room. The room I booked (with a corporate discount) was $450/night. Normally it would have been about $600. The room I stayed in normally goes for about $800/night. I paid $279 for two nights for a room with 2-double beds (via the Starwood website). It was a fair price, but in hind sight I wouldn't pay a ton more money. The location is unbeatable - quick walk to Central Park, high end shopping and Time Square. The hotel itself is beautiful and the pool/roof top view is amazing. The staff was really friendly and quick when answering questions. \\nThe draw backs would be the beds. Comfortable, but their using European doubles which are much smaller than American sizing. The pressure in the shower was really weak. I made a 4-minute phone call to a 267 number and it was $19.54 USD. Ouch for calling a local cell phone. They seemed really concerned with having 4 people in a room with double beds. They didn't charge us extra, but gave me the impression it wasn't going to be enjoyable or permitted. \\nSome people commented on the room temperature - didn't notice any problems. Also, I noticed other comments around fees for extra glasses etc. We ordered extra towels, glasses & pillows and zero charges were against our account.\\nOverall, good amenities and location and I'd go back...but it doesn't present a ton of value in my opinion. Based on the room rate of $350 before tax I expected better. Aside from the lobby which is exquisite the hotel looks dated. The big rotating TV stand in the middle of the room didn't help matters, and all it really did was take up space. Not to mention this is the first hotel I've stayed at in a couple of years that didn't have a flat screen in the room. Sun deck has nice veiws but the astro-turf and lawn furniture could use an upgrade. Hotel does not recognize SPG status, despite being a SPG hotel, which made the check-in process more unpleasant than expected, as there is no semblance of order at the front desk. The hotel has definitely left its glory days in the past, but is still in moderate condition, although greatly in need of a refresh. The cartoons playing in the elevators add a trashy vibe. Were other SPG hotels available on short notice, I would have certainly not even bothered with this place It was a treat to have a short stay at the Le Parker Meridien in NYC. The room was beautiful and the service excellent. From Michael at the front desk to the house keeper on my floor, I was given 5 star treatment. Plus, the cartoons in the elevator actually made me wish for extra stops. Kuddos and great job to the staff. I cannot wait to stay there on my next trip. Le Parker Meridien is a perfect location for tourists and business travelers. It's close to Central Park, Times Square, and right next to a subway stop. The staff were very friendly on check-in and check-out. High speed internet was very fast. Best of all is the fitness center - two floors with plenty of treadmills, exercise bikes, weight room, and more. I'll definitely be going back. \\nThe rates can get pricey depending on the season so it's not always the best value. If you can get this hotel for under $300 per night, you should definitely book it. Lovely stay for 2 nights for 2 native New Yorkers in need of two nights away. While we both work in the city it was great to have one work day morning w/out a commute and two 'date nights' out on the town. Our room was so quiet you could not hear a thing from other rooms/hallway/above/below/elevator and we are used to fine hotels. The service was first rate including Darius @ the front desk (Dominican Republic and a reader of our publication El Diario La Prensa so we made friends fast!). Down the st is a cute cuban place and \"Thom Thom\" Korean where I enjoyed a solo glass of champagne, spicy tofu soup and a quite moment of reflection. While the \"Burger Joint\" is a big draw, we skipped that in favor of pizza @ Big Nicks on Bway and breakfast @ Norma's...thank you! Spent two nights at the Parker Meridien for business in April -- both were outstanding. No problems with upgrades as I am a Starwood Platinum, but the staff was friendly and polite regardless. Location great for walking pretty much anywhere in midtown. I left an award behind in the closet -- didn't realize until I got home -- called security and housekeeping. They found it two days later and FedEx'd it to my office. Glad they found it, but the extra points go for them already having my address and contact information already on file when they picked up the phone. Le Parker Meridien brings you comfort, luxury, superb food, and good old-fashioned fun!\\nWhen was the last time you caught a Looney Toon or Popeye cartoon? No fear, just take\\nthe elevator and catch up on some classic cartoons! Instant comfort and some chuckles\\ntoo. Entering Le Parker Meridien is luxury at it's best! Arches, columns, service, gorgeous\\nbar at night / coffee bar by day, and gourmet treats for breakfast, to the best burger you ever\\ndid taste! The rooms are decorated just right, stocked refrigerators, the suites have inviting\\nseating areas, and the showers are big, and beautiful. Don't let me forget the staff, they are\\nso pleasant and the atmosphere is so friendly! After staying at several top NYC hotels, Le\\nParker Meridien is the stand-out hands down! I love this hotel, mostly because I am SPG gold and always get a park view on a high floor, and I am fascinated by the view of the park from the outdoor roof - same view you would pay $20 a person for with thousands of others on the top of the rock. Other positives - it is insanely clean. I encountered someone vacuuming and polishing the elevator more than once during my stay. Recently, the hotel began charging $50 a night for your pet - which I thought was a bit steep considering it was free 3 months ago. The prices for food and in room service are downright insane. Breakfast in your room runs close to $50 a person after the taxes and service charges - I honestly don't know how you can ask for that with a straight face, but the room itself is large, clean, and the bed is extraordinarily comfortable. A make-over is probably needed soon to get rid of the bulky swiveling CRT TV that takes up a huge portion of the room, but I don't watch TV anyway so I'm not that impressed with other hotels flat panel TVs that don't get an HD signal 90% of the time anyway. The service has dropped off a bit from a year ago when I stayed here, but I still got what I needed - it just wasn't as courteous. I stayed at the Le Parker Meridien, earlier this week, and it was 'ok.' First of all, the location is great and I did find the rooms really interesting (if small) and quiet. But, there were a few flaws. Everyone mentioned that the rooms are hot and I cant stress this enough. Miserable hot. I called down to have an engineer 'fix this' (per the sign on the thermostat) but no one ever came. The extra 10 dollars for the gym was steep, but worth it. Great gym. But, going back to an 80+degree room is gross! I also thought it was strange that the restaurant (toted as the best breakfast in NYC) doesnt open until 7. When you travel for business, you often have to eat breakfast before 7 so that was kind of lame. \\nOh and one other thing happened: The cleaning folks put moisturizer in the shower instead of conditioner (i.e. I got two bottles of lotion and no conditioner). A lot of you all wouldnt care about this, but I have to say: that sucked. I put a full bottle of lotion in my hair (of course, it is my fault that I didnt catch it before pouring). Just sort of sucks that the cleaning people didnt catch that. Lesson learned.... This is a fine hotel - decent sized rooms, good location, and comfortable enough. What made me think less of this place was the fact that they charge you for everything (a tooth brush, gym, extra glasses, etc) and many of their prices are pricey. I was on a business trip and was considering ordering room service after a long work day - even though everything was being covered by my employer but I still had a hard time ordering basic (hotel) food for such high prices. Had a great overnight stay here. The junior suite was more spacious than I would have expected for NYC. Bed was very comfortable. Service was good. I would return!\\nMake sure you get a burger at the Burger Joint in the lobby. One of the best burgers I've ever had! The good points:\\nI have stayed here a number of times during business trips to NYC.It is a great location not too far to walk to most Midtown meetings and close to Central Park and Lincoln Center .Very good size rooms by New York standards and most of all they are light (I hate the dark Edwardian hotels where you can't see to read ) .\\nThe bad points\\nEverything is extra-$16 a day for internet access,$10 for every visit to the gym .Call me a cheapskate but even on business expenses I'm not prepared to pay their prices for breakfast so just grab something from Starbucks opposite\\nHowever the thing that really grated was being stuck here for 5 days due to it being impossible to get back to Europe due to the volcanic ash problem .The room rate crept from the initial pre booked (and admittedly therefore discounted ) rate up to $399 a night ,then $569 ,then they wanted $619 and only by going on the internet to prove they had rooms at $569 did they reluctantly agree to reduce the rate .I know this is the market in operation and my choice was to simply check out and go to the Marriott but when you're spending hours on the phone and net simply trying to find a way home it wasn't someting I wanted to do-so I experienced Starwood greed in operation .\\nFinally I know this is New York but my room (on the 20th floor ) suffered from a huge amount of outside noise-i never had one uninterrupted night sleep all the time i was there.\\nI think the time has come for me to exercise my consumer rights and vote with my feet on my next new York visit We stayed 4 nights in a Jr Suite with two adults and two young children. Our room was comfortable and fit our family well. There seem to be no perks for a gold status guest, though we did get a late check out without a problem.\\nFrom the check-in to the check-out the staff was great. The pool seemed small at first but our family had a great time in it. I would not recommend it for lap swimming. Also, the pool was uncomfortably cold one morning. Even the kids found it too cold to swim in.\\nThe room was stuffy at times. I recommend turning the thermostat down to 67 and leaving it on. I did notice a difference when I did that one night. I learned that it's a mistake to turn off the fan. Our room was very quiet. I did not hear any noise from the hallway and the street noise was minimal (we were on the 33rd floor).\\nWe did not eat at the hotel. Instead we got breakfast at the markets and Starbucks nearby. Restaurants worth trying within a block are Remi, Redeye Grill, and Beacon. Let me begin by saying that the staff at Le Parker Meridien and the services they provide are top notch. From the momenet we stepped into the awesome lobby, we were treated like guests should be treated. The efficient and kind staff as well as the clean modern lines of the hotel's decor made it worth every penny I would be spending. Or so I thought.\\nBefore I get into what I think is wrong with the heart of the matter is, let me list the good things: \\n-The lobby and the three \"restaurants\" that inhabit there; Erma's is fab for breakfast through lunch. The Burger Joint allowed for a late supper that reminded me of all the better parts of the late 70's and early 80's with great burgers, fries and shakes. The newer bar area off the lobby reminds me of a Moorish tea joint and had great munchies and drinks late into the night. \\n-The staff. I won't drag this out. Quite honestly, I only stay at 4 and 5 star hotels. The Parker staff could teach lessons on how hoteliers should treat valued guests.\\n-The pool and gym were worth the effort. Especially for Mid-Town.\\nNow the problem: I have read that others have faced this as well. Our room, on a very high floor or the Parker, was clean and modern. Well kept and tidy, thanks to a crack housekeeping staff. \\nNo, what makes the entire trip difficult is the room TEMPERATURE.\\nI understand, after speaking off the record to the engineer for the hotel that this is an on-going problem ever since the re-model some years ago. Case in point: Our room had an electronic thermostat. It obviously had a power supply of some sort, but it quite simply was not connected to any mechanism that allowed cool air to enter our room. I had it turned down to 58 degrees F. Nothing. I was able to force the window open past the 4 inch mark so that cooler air could enter the room and keep it reasonable so that we could sleep. Even so, my portable alarm clock that registers temperature (correctly, I might add), showed it to be 85 degrees F at midnight. This is simply unacceptable.\\nDear powers that be for Le Parker Meridien, please solve this before my next visit. MAKE SURE THE TEMPERATURE CAN BE SET BY THE GUEST SO THAT THEY CAN REMAIN COMFORTABLE. JUST PUTTING A STICKER ON THE THERMOSTAT ADVISING TO CALL THE FRONT DESK MAKES NO SENSE IF THE AIR CONDITIONER SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK! IF SO, I WILL RETRACT THIS REVIEW AND POST A FAR MORE GLOWING ONE INSTEAD. PLEASE, I BEG OF YOU. i usually recommend this hotel for guests when they come to visit me in NYC. My mom usually stays here when she comes. First, it's comfortable, clean, fairly spacious for NYC, has some sort of style and personality. It has just enough style for out of town guests without them feeling uncomfortable or out of their element. the views from the windows aren't great, but whatever. it's better than staying at your typical Marriott hotel.\\nsecond, the location. it's in midtown and a couple blocks away from central park. centrally located. close enough to times square but far enough away from it so you don't have to be part of the tourist trap riff raff. closer to the stores on 5th avenue and madison than anything else which is nice.\\nthird, there are two good restaurants in the hotel...norma's and Burger Joint. both are NY experiences and fun places to take guests. burger joint is literally a joint. a diner atmosphere in a fancy hotel. but the burgers are good. really good. we go there when we're in the neighborhood. norma's just serves breakfast and i can go there only about once a year because it's really too much food and by that time I've forgotten how indulgent it is.\\nfourth...a swimming pool and outdoor terrace!!! this is a rare amenity for NY and a hidden perk of this hotel. the pool is covered by a glass roof but it is still amazing and you can see central park from it. so this is the perk, i get to swim when my mom comes and visits.\\ni know everyone complains about \"noise\" in NYC and you might hear some in your room, but this is NYC! you are going to hear it regardless. it's just what you sign up for. Stayed here twice. Got ripped off twice. Everything costs. Had to pay $7 to have some glasses delivered to the room. Unbelievably they don't tell you till you get there that their \"double beds\" are actually \"oversized twins\" — nowhere near big enough for a couple to sleep comfortably. They provide a huge coffee table book about the \"history of childhood\" in each room — but there's no coffee machine! I forgot my toothbrush, most hotels would give you one gratis, not here, they want to sell you a kit for $10. The bar is ridiculously expensive and uncomfortable — but has a beautiful ceiling. And worst of all you can't control the heat in your room, you have to call an engineer — who took the screws out the window to open as it was too hot. A Starwood disgrace. The Le Parker Meridien is a one of the smaller hotels in the area. Located one block south of Central Park and next door to Carnegie Hall, the passer-by would miss the hotel unless knowing its exact location. \\nOur week long stay had some ups and downs. Location and proximity to the Metro were perfect. Walking distance to several other attractions were also a plus. \\nThe room was fully modernized and offered everything for a family, even one that planned on spending little time at the hotel. \\nOur only mention would be the food offered at the restaurant. Norma's, the main restaurant, served a great breakfast. Omelettes, pancakes and orange juice for three came to $130.00. While I had three refills on the OJ, I'd love to find the justification for such a price. Needless to say, with all the great, authentic diners surrounding the hotel, Norma's is probably a main source of income for the hotel. A second restaurant, with no discernible name, but was rumored to offer some of the best hamburgers in the city, was inaccessible due to the long lines that formed by late morning and remained until evening. \\nOtherwise, I would highly recommend and return to this hotel. It services a variety of people. My wife saw Rachel Welch walk to her car several times while doing a morning talk show. The sense that other celebrities were staying there, along side the average tourist, was evident, but kept subtle by the staff. \\nThe bar area is done in a Middle Eastern style with great service at more reasonable prices. \\nThe staff was able to field any request and, other than the slow bell hop service at check-out (to their credit, the hotel was sold out), the stay was carefree and in an ideal location for our site seeing. \\nA hotel for the business traveler and family vacation (as well as Rachel Welch). I love this place. Great location, comfortable rooms, great beds. Norma's restaurant is an asset as well, if you are willing to pay through the nose for breakfast. Upper floors have postcard views of central park. Not as stylish as it aspires to be, and will underwhelm those looking for something akin to Parker Palm Springs. Still, a very solid option for business or pleasure in NYC. My boyfriend and I stayed at Le Parker Meridien for 2 nights in March 2010. This was my second stay at the hotel, and it was the second time I have left New York satisfied. The location can't be beat. It is within walking distance to Central Park, TImes Square, Madison Square Garden, etc. The lobby is immaculate and service is quick to assist with check in and luggage. I was upgraded for being a Starwood Preferred Guest, and the room was minimal, stylish, and spacious. It may not be to some peoples' liking, but I prefer chic to gaudy. The bathroom is a bit worn, as well as some of the fixtures in the room, but only if you look close. The bed is soo comfortable, and the decor is fresh. Do not even think about ordering room service, it is outrageously expensive, as is Norma's, the restaurant with renowned breakfast (way overpriced and NOT very good.) Overall, great hotel, as is the whole Meridien chain. I've stayed in NYC Starwood hotels many times and during crowded peak seasons, but I've never had such disappointing service -- reservation mix-up, room not ready at 5pm, someone walking into our room (while we were in it) with a key thinking thinking they were checking into THEIR room, and frustrating long waits for check-in, elevators, getting someone on the phone, waiting for the car. Beds were not as comfortable as the Westin and W hotels.\\nOn a more positive note, as a platinum member we got a 4pm check out and free wireless internet. Our junior suite was nice, and our daughter said the fold-out couch was comfortable. Location is nice, too, near Central Park and 5th Ave shopping. Stayed at the Parker Meridien in March and as ever very reliable. Quick, friendly check in. Larger than average rooms for New York with a nice view over the park. Great location straight onto main Avenues and a quick walk to Time Square. The bar is always good and this time we tried the burger bar that is always busy. Good burgers if a bit pricey! I appreciated the friendly service of the staff, from the people behind the front desk to the cleaning lady to the luggage boys. The location of the hotel is good, close to 5th Avenue, Central Park and Times Square. We had an wonderful experience at Le Parker Meridien in New York City. Even before our arrival, we experienced superior service. I had booked the room on the website at the regular rate, but realized later that I had enough Starwoods Preferred guest points to cash in for an award night. So I called the hotels, revenue office to find out if I could switch my reservation from cash to points. The person that I spoke with was excellent (I can't remember his name...maybe Jason?) He was very helpful and stayed on the line with me and the central reservation office until the sithover was complete. Thanks!\\nWhen we arrived at the hotel on the day of check-in, we were please to find that the property was modern and well appointed. I had alerted the hotel staff that we were celebrating our anniversary when I made the reservation and they pulled out all the stops to ensure that we had a great stay. From the time we arrived, every employee that we interacted with wished us a happy anniversary. Then, not 30 minutes after we got to our room, we received a lovely platter of chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate truffles with a nice note congratulating us on our anniversary. We both LOVE chocolate, so it was a welcomed treat :)\\nOur room was great. It was located on the 37th floor and we had a totally unobstructed view of Central Park. We sat in the window seat for almost an hour admiring the view. The hotel is conveniently located for anyone travelling to New York to experience the theatre and other attractions. It was not far from Broadway (a short cab ride of about $6) or from an array of well known restaurants. We went to the classic French Restaurant La Grenouille, which was excellent. All in all, we had a great time in New York and a memorable experience at Le Parker Meridien. As a Starwoods member, I was upgraded with a view of the Park. It was such a treat at such an affordable rate. I would go back in a minute. Physically and by location not a bad hotel. However, when we went to checkout we were presented with a bill that significantly exceeded in price the quote I had obtained from them online. They said they were charging an additional $30/night for a rollaway bed for my child even though my online receipt clearly listed 3 guests as well as detailed other charges which did not include the bed charge. Other gripes: expensive internet access, a stiff additional fee to use the exercise facility, and a room so hot I had trouble sleeping- and with no temperature controls in the room. We had a great time at this hotel, not far from central Park and 5th avenue. The suite was well furnished and spacious. We had a great burger at the Burger joint downstairs, it was a nice surprise. Apparently it has the best gym in America but we didn't have time to go. It should be open 24h I think. The rooftop pool was a disappointment however, too small and crowded. The cartoons in the elevators are a fun touch. Service was without reproach. My husband and I stayed at the Parker for 3 nights for his 40th birthday and we wern't disappointed. We checked in at the front desk with Andrew who was super friendly and upgraded us to a Central Park view room because we have SPG. The view was sweeping, the room was clean and nicely appointed and very quiet. The housekeeping staff kept our room made up and tidy and changed our sheets the third night.\\nThe burger joint has a great burger but pricey ($29 for two burgers, two fries, and two Diet Cokes) but we were in an out quickly. The proximity to Central Park is handy and we had our friends come to our hotel to celebrate at Nave, the coffee/bar bar after taking a bike ride through the park...the drinks are expensive but we ordered a bottle of Veuve champagne for only $100. We also spotted a movie star relaxing at the next table! Check out was easy. We left our charger plugged in next to the bed, told security, and they quickly went to retrieve it for us! We will definitely make the Parker our hotel again and again for many years to come. Our family of four stayed here for three nights - two rooms side by side. The location is perfect for Midtown sightseeing and shopping. Close to Central Park as well. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were a good size - enough rooms for family to visit us and hang out in the room during endless rain storms. Very clean and quiet all day and night. Too bad we couldn't empty the minibar and use it as a fridge. The pool was great for kids to swim at all hours. Never too crowded. We splurged and had breakfast at Norma's our last day - it was fantastic! At $140 for four, not an everyday thing, but worth it at least once. Also loved the Burger Joint hidden away in the lobby - worth the crowds for a quick burger. \\nA few minor complaints. The parking was over $50 per day which seems crazy, but may be typical for NYC. There is a charge of $16 for wireless or wired internet access, which is ridiculous for a hotel in this category. Motel 6 provided free internet for heavens sake! The room key cards are an odd elongated shape which makes it hard to fit them in a pocket. \\nOverall, a great place for a family to stay in NYC. Staying in the hotel right now. Want to write something before I forgot. We booked a junior suite. Room is clean and the size is acceptable. However, there is no coffee machine, or tea bag. They have a mini bar so that they are telling you if you want something to drink, pay (or eat the ice :P). I want to find out how much the services are, but there is no booklet or whatever. I asked the front desk and the gentlemen has no clue. \\nThe worst is the beds. The sofa bed is horrible. I know how it feels to sleep on the sofa bed, but it should not be that BAD... I lay down on the bed and my body almost flip because the middle part of the bed almost collaspe. This is just unacceptable. The king bed is not any better. The middle part of the bed is also going down. \\nIn general, my experience with front desk is pretty nice. But with housekeeping is horrible. I made a few request during my stay. The first night, I asked them to set up the sofa bed for me. I think I had wait until I fell asleep and then I called after 30 minutes and finally somebody came. The second time I request a sewing kit and waited for 20 minutes again. When I call the next time, another person told me the hotel has no sewing kit! The whole communicatin process is so weird to me. I am not sure if I am talking to the housekeeping department when I call but definitely they didn't hear my request. The thid time, I decided to get an extra bed and sheet to sleep on another bench since the sofa bed is so horrible. I requested the bed sheet around 10:30, and same thing happened, did not hear anything at 11:30. Then, I called again and tell them i can even go down to get the sheet. The front desk girl was apologetic, but it doesn't mean that will make me stay up longer. Finally, the housekeeper came around 11:30. She handed me the stuff, but there is no sheet!! Gladly I know where their place is and chase after immediately. Otherwise, I have to wait another hour. \\nAll in all, if this happen in red roof inn or super 8 (no offense to these two motels), I understand. But this is still Le Meridien, a Starwood Property. Based on other people's review. If you want to stay in a hotel that is better and comparable in terms of price, maybe Park Central would be a good choice. Where do I start? With the fact that I stayed 3 nights prepaid and they put a $300 pending charge on my credit card? Really? No one has ever done that before and I thought it was a bit much.\\nAlso, you have to pay outrageous rates to use their facilities that they advertise so heavily--to use (to walk in-nothing special) the gym it's $10/day, the internet is `$18/day and the business center charges you $8/min for internet use. \\nBut, to top it all off, the hotel rooms don't have their own heat/air units. It's on a central system so there's no way for you to cool your room if it's too hot if they are currently running the heat. Wtf? The concierge told me that they could arrange to have my window opened. It was raining and I had a toddler with me in my 20th floor room. Are you serious? It was so hot I had a lot of trouble even sleeping. Also, the hotel desk staff (including the concierge) seem to just not care at all about helping their guests. Very apathetic, actually. I would stay away--for the money there are many other better hotels in Midtown Manhattan. I stayed at the Parker Meridien for a combination of business & leisure, and was given a room with a great view of Central Park. The room was very spacious for New York standards, comfortable beds, clean bathroom with quality toiletries. Location is great, easy to get to where-ever you want to go. Nice buzzy atmosphere in the adjoining restaurant downstairs (can't remember the name), and the burger joint in the lobby is also a great alternative for room service. I would happily stay here again. I \"Pricelined\" this hotel and my bid of $175 was accepted. I think I could have done even better but I was still happy with that price. We checked in late Saturday night and left early Sunday morning. Check in was quick and easy, the room was fine, nothing special, nice toiletries, clean. My only complaint that was I couldn't lower the temperature in the room, despite what appeared to be an adjustable thermostat. I think it's locked in place and you have to call to get them to change it because there was a note posted to that effect. The room was very warm and I couldn't sleep well at that temperature. I could have called for help, and it even seemed like the windows might have opened, but I didn't try. Overall, for a NYC hotel, the price plus convenience of the location were excellent! Lovely hotel, great views, attentive staff, good location. One big drawback was the pool. It has a great view and the staff assured me the water was clean, and that the pool had just undergone a big maintenance, but the orange plastic rope divider across the pool was full of black yucky stains and made me wonder about the cleanliness of the water. It was surprising, given the attention paid to other details in the rooms and public areas. This is a no frills hotel and is a good value if you can get in for under $300 a night (which I did). If I had to pay more than that, I would go elsewhere.\\nPositives:\\nIt has clean lines, modern but not upscale decor, and a good location in midtown. The rooms are about average sized. The bathrooms are clean and well maintained (however are on the smaller size, you basically have to step over the toilet to get into the shower). Tom and Jerry playing on the elevator TV is amusing. Elevator wait is relatively short. There is an uncrowded Starbucks right across the street. The hotel has entrances on both 56th and 57th streets, which is convenient.\\nNegatives:\\nNot a great check in and room assignment experience. I am a Starwood elite and reserved a king size bed. I was told at check in they were sold out of king beds and I could only get a two bed room. The beds were tiny -- smaller than full size, closer to twin. Although comfortable, they are platform beds (no boxspring and you are close to the ground). The check in persons were not particularly friendly and never once apologized for not having the room I had reserved. They also appear to have a pretty disorganized check in in system. They use these ancient Mac laptops at the front desk to process the check ins, and they are very slow. There was no concierge at the front door, anywhere to be found, both times I tried to get a taxi (it wasn't difficult to get one, but there was no help). Old style Sony Trinitron television sets in the rooms. No morning newspaper or morning coffee. I'll try and make this short and sweet as the concierge gave off the vibe that her guests should be that way. . \\nThe best thing about the LPM is its location. Plain and simple. Rates for a $300+ per nite stay.. you could do better. The check-in was fine and bell staff were courteous. But, it seemed like the few times I asked about basic 'getting around' information to the concierge you sensed they were either not interested or tired of talking to guests. I can understand they get mundane and asked the same ?s all the time. But, where is professionalism? I asked a question in a polite way and told \"didn't you ask me this question before\"...w/o letting me finish my ? to learn that it wasn't the same question. Regardless, replies like that just made me feel this hotel is not worth my stay. This is in addition, to the fact, that my room, though overall on the surface looked ok, had peeling paint on the shower ceiling....not good. I'm glad that I didn't explore more b/c who knows how much dust and guck were around chairs, closets, rugs, and the desk!!! Plus, I don't like being charged $10 for an on-site gym and oh, there's another charge to use the small racquetball court w/ b-ball net. Finally, you're better off going to a nearby FEDEX Kinko's to use the internet vs. their overpriced business center. There are other hotels out in NYC that earn your hard earned money!!!! Le Parker Meridien was absolutely all I could expect and more. I was more than satisfied with the cleanliness of the hotel along with its luxurious amenities and accessories. The concierge was incredibly helpful, as were the people I spoke with at the check-in desk. I hope the hotel doesn't change the next time I visit. I admit that I am one of those people who loves NYC yet I can still be impressed. Can it get any better? Yes, stay at the Meridien! The recipe for a memorable stay in NYC. Start with a great location -- a short cab ride from Penn Station. Close to Broadway theaters, restaurants, shopping and Central Park. Add a welcoming ambience from the street and into lobby. Mix in some luxury but give it clean lines and a hip Euro vibe. Cartoons on the elevator. Nothing stuffy about this hotel. Thai fusion and milkshakes at 2 am. A view of Central Park that would bring tears to Olmsted's eyes! Put it all together with Incredible service -- open, friendly but not overly familiar and then you have a fantastic stay in NY. Regrets...a few... I never made it back up to the penthouse pool (yes there's a swimming pool 40 something stories about the city -- and the crowd at the lobby restaurant kept me away. Okay so that means I have to go back soon! We recently stayed here with two of our teenage sons on a 5-day trip to NYC.\\npro's\\n* great concierges (Thanks Fernanda for all your efforts'really splendid)\\n* location (however, there are obviously lots of other hotels in every pricerange around here)\\n* sublime (and thus pricy, but who cares; \"when in Rome.....\") breakfast at Norma's!\\n* friendly staff\\n* good beds and pillows!\\n* reasonably well sized rooms. (forget about the view on Central Park, perhaps only the very highest floors do have limited view on Central Park; the rest is looking at bricks and windows from other buildings)\\ncons\\n* nice to make the fact very known that yoiu have a pool on the 42nd floor, but when it's out of order due to maintenance for over a week, guests would like to be informed IN ADVANCE!!! (especially if they booked your hotel just because of this pool) Giving a voucher for a hotelpool a couple of blocks away does not do the trick here. \\n* we would have appreciated it to have rooms where wc, sink, minibar (needs to be cold instead of hot, or am I mistaken here) and windows are operating correctly (especially if you claim to be a 5-star hotel). A paintbrush here and there would not hurt either.\\n* being out of adaptors for a couple of days and then finally giving a wrong adaptor? OK, us Europeans should obviously have brought ourr own one, but still a pitty in service..\\n* we're those guests who like to have their room/beds made before 5PM.\\nHowever, an average hotel on an excellent locaton. If you can book a nice package you get reasonable good value for money. That's if this hotel and its management are prepared to follow up on some of the criticism on a.o. this site. This was the first experience of my family in the big apple. It was a trip that our child desired to visit the city of \"Spiderman\". We started having already planned part of the cultural visits, but the first great surprise was that, thanks to a chat we had with the hotel concierge that great connoisseur of the city gave us the most important indicator to enjoy the city at its best. The hotel is strategically located in the heart of Manhattan, and from here it is possible reach anywhere in the city in no time. The Junior Suite assigned statan extremely convenient for travelers like us with a child. Cleaning and impeccable attention to detail throughout the hotel. To save time, like good Italians, we had a quick breakfast at the bar with fragrant \"croassants\" and italian cappuccino. One regret ... have never been able to enjoy the snack bar of the Hotel, which boasts the best hamburgers in the city, as we have always found endless queues ... be a reason to return to New York. The view from the wonderful rooftop pool is breathtaking. Too bad we spent only one week in NYC. My daughter and I stayed here to celebrate her 15th birthday by seeing a few shows, museums, etc. Great staff. Loved the staff at the Burger Joint - the best burgers at the best price in NYC. Fantastic water pressure in the shower. AND they take Starwood points. We're here every year for a conference and we tend to spend a few extra days in the city so we can play and run amok. This year, we discovered that LPM accepted Starwood points - SCORE! Bye-bye NY Sheraton, we liked you but it's time to try a new neighborhood. \\nAfter reading several reviews specifically calling out the fact that you should ask for the new tower, we did just that when we made our reservations. Checking in, we received one of the big bummers of the experience, the hotel key card. The thing is twice as long as a normal credit card and therefore impossible to keep in a wallet - truly, one of those little things like a paper cut that become huge. It was a serious pain in the rear to try to store the darn thing when we weren't in our room. LPM, make the keys a normal size! NOW! \\nTo offset the grouchiness that the abnormal key card invoked, once we entered the elevators we discovered that LPM had a sense of humor, showing cartoons in the elevators. Depending on which car you rode in, you could see Charlie Chaplin, Tom & Jerry or classic cartoons such as Droopy. \\nWe rode to the 37th floor chuckling at the antics of Tom & Jerry and upon exiting on our floor were stopped at the sight of the amazing view of Central Park to the left. Just gorgeous. Off to find our room, we were pleasantly surprised that we were on the side of the hotel facing Central Park and thus our room had the same amazing view out a big picture window. Nice. \\nThe room itself is relatively spacious for a New York City hotel room. We brought P90X DVDs with us and were able to both workout comfortably in-room. Also, know that you can rent a fridge for your room if you're so inclined. Since we were there for a week, it was money well-spent. Carnegie deli tastes just as good over several meals in-room! \\nOverall, very happy with the hotel and we will be returning next year. Good show, Le Parker Meridien. My husband, son and I stayed at this Le Meridien for seven nights, combining business and vacation. Positives:\\n* Midtown location was convenient and within walking distance to Time Square theaters, museums, and Central Park.\\n* Our room faced a courtyard (possibly an alley). From the 18th floor we couldn't see the ground. But this inward facing room was extremely quiet, a rarity for NYC.\\n* Once we found it, the blackout shade made it easy to sleep late in the morning. \\n* Pillows were pretty good. Two feather & two composite type.\\nNegatives:\\n* The first night we were awakened by loud knocking on our door at about 3:30 am. I peeked through the security hole & I'm pretty sure a hooker was standing at my door. I told her to go away as she was checking her phone. I informed front desk who said a guard was on duty in the lobby. \\n* The bed felt like a futon. It was a fairly hard mattress on a wood platform, with no box spring. There was a featherbed topper on the mattress. After sleeping on this for a week my hips & knees were killing me.\\n* The maid did NOT clean the toilet the whole time we were there, except possibly to run a brush quickly on the sides of the bowl (maybe). As a result, after 7 days the \"throat\" of the toilet was disgusting. If I had a brush I would have cleaned it myself.\\n* We were given face cloths only two of the seven days we were there. When I asked the maid I was told that they were \"out\". One day when I asked she gave me three, but when I came back later that evening, she had taken one back.\\n* There was a $30 per night charge for the rollaway. The rollaway was set up with the mattress upside down. We realized that after my son complained about the bed being uncomfortable on the 5th night.\\n* There was no corkscrew or wine glasses, but there was wine in the minibar. Room service brought them up about 15 minutes after I called. However, the wine opener was very cheap & we couldn't open the wine with it. I went down to the front desk & they tried, but couldn't open it either. Someone took it to the bar to get it opened. \\n* There is a fridge in the room but it is dedicated to the minibar. We were told that even if you opened the door it would trigger a charge. Of course I had to keep reminding my son to stop opening it. If it had a lock on it, there wouldn't have been a problem. $6.00 for M&M's... please!\\n* We had some delicious leftovers from a dinner that I wanted to save for my daughter, who lives in NYC. I called housekeeping and was told there is a $6.44 charge for that service. Huh?\\n* As with most expensive hotels, there is a daily charge for Internet. It is $20 for 24 hours. Why do the cheap hotels offer it free and the expensive hotels charge? This I will never understand. It is a relic of the days when we were using modems through phone lines. There is no justification for Internet charges.\\nWe will look for another hotel on our next trip to New York. We stayed for 5 days over Valentine's weekend. The staff was friendly and the rooms were adequate, except for one day when we got back to the hotel at 5:30PM and the room wasn't cleaned. We called then and again at 6:30PM when we went out to have the room cleaned. Needless to say at 12:30AM we returned to a dirty room, our bed unmade and towels on the floor.\\nThe toilet backed up 3 times, the third time after it was worked on for a half hour. When I complained that we were leaving and needed to use it, the front desk told us to take a water from the mini bar and they wouldn't charge us.\\nNo fridge in the room, old TV's, rugs didn't look too clean.\\nRestaurant downstairs, Norma's had a reservation for 5 for breakfast (other people were in our party). We wanted to add another person. We spent over an hour in total, talking to the host and the manager. They said they couldn't accomodate 6, then they changed their mind and said they could, and then on the day of the reservation, when our cousin was already driving from upstate to meet us, they said they couldn't accomodate us.\\nIn the bar, good atmosphere, tea is $9, beer is $12 and a glass of wine $18 but the almonds and mixed nuts (free) are very good.\\nNew York has many great hotels, most for less expensive, Save your money and don't go to Le Parker Meridian I love the location, the bar is great to grab a drink after meetings or to relax, it's close to the park, museums & shopping but the service is what makes Le Parker Meridien my favorite hotel. I was interviewing for a new job and a little nervous and Anandi at the front desk wished me luck and then checked back the next day to see how it went. (Who even remembers your name anymore?) She was so charming and sincere, it really made me feel valued. The whole staff is helpful and very approachable, professional but relaxed. I would recommend staying here to anyone who wants a little TLC from an unpretentious staff. Came on a long weekend to catch up on some shows. The check-in was smooth, the room although not huge was plenty big. The shower had the best water pressure EVER. Our concierge Andy was very knowledgeable and helpful. If I had anything to pick on was the lack of a room coffeemaker (it would have been a nice touch on those freezing days). I read complaints about the staff being rude, did not have that experience at all. And the gym charge is not unexpected in NYC....great stay :) I've traveled around the world and have stayed at many 4-5 star hotels and Le Parker Meridien in New York is the best hotel I've stayed at. My husband and I arrived on Friday afternoon and Joshua at the front desk was so helpful and nice and offered us a late check out on Sunday (without us having to ask) and upgraded us to a room with a view of Central Park. We later found out the hotel offers late check out until 5pm - so generous! The room was so spacious and the biggest we've stayed in for New York which is usually very cramped and the hotel gives complimentary shot glasses to their guests and has Peter Thomas Roth toileteries. Loved that! The gym/club which we didn't get to use on this stay but look forward to using on future stays has yoga and dance classes, racquet ball courts, and includes a session with a trainer for the $10 fee. Norma's for breakfast in the hotel was great. Very expensive but worth the experience. Lastly, we had the best doorman the day we left who approached us to help with our bags and let us know that our car was waiting for us. Overall, great hotel, great staff and great location! Can't wait to stay here again on our next visit. Great place! Convient to sightseeing and nightlife. The best breakfast in the city at Norma's, and an absolutely great burger at the Burger Joint! In the early hours of my trip to NYC, it was looking to be a nightmare. I had reservations through expedia on the wrong day of my arrival without the possibility of cancelation. After contacting Expedia and the Management of Le Parker Meridien they were more than willing to work with me. Although I was unable to receive my original low pricing from Expedia, Le Parker Meridien gave me a complementary upgrade to a Park view room! The room alone was worth the foolish mistake on my part; brilliant view, cozy as home, and spacious enough to live there for months! But if somehow you don't like the view from your room, go up the elevator to the roof deck/indoor pool where you can see the entire city. Rockefeller and the Empire State building will charge you an arm and a leg for something your hotel offers for free! Lastly, location! location! location! Smack dab in the heart of the city. Close to shopping, subways, and everything else you need/don't need. I think you get my point that I highly recommend this hotel and I am personally looking forward to my next stay, hope to see you there. I stayed at this hotel in early January using my Starwood points. Starwood made a reservation on my behalf and I stayed at the hotel for three consecutive nights. When I returned home I found that the Parker Meridien had double-billed me. I called to resolve the problem and initially I was reassured that the wrongful charge would be taken off my credit card account. \\nI have repeatedly checked my account since then to find that no such credit had occurred. Despite numerous attempts to contact the Accounting department of the hotel, my calls and requests have not been honored in a prompt fashion. Clearly this hotel does not honor frequent travelers nor does it abide by codes of professional conduct. I would only recommend staying at this hotel if someone else is paying for it, lest one find an unpleasant surprise in the form a double charge.\\nI have stayed at the Meridien in the past but this incident has led me to take my business elsewhere.\\nIncidentally, the room that the hotel initially assigned me was in an utter state of disarray. Top marks for great location v near to central park, Times Square, well placed for Lincoln Centre. Great view of central park from the window by the lift ( and presumably from rooms if you pay more for it)\\nIt's aiming at being achingly trendy but doesnt quite feel like it gets it right.\\nThe entrances on 57th and 56th are both inconspicuous and very hard to spot - cabbies often dont know how to find it. You have to walk through the bar to enter from 57th, which must detract from the vibe in the bar. Check in and out were efficient and swift.\\nI read that Normas is hip and great and fancied trying it, but didnt as it looked dead while we were there, with no clear signing, no natural light, only a few businessmen ever seemed to be in there. The burger place must be well hidden as we never spotted it! theres no guide to the hotel in the room so you wont know what facilities it has!\\nPool is disappointing, with tiny changing room with only one shower, so must be hell if it gets busy, but a pool is quite rare in NY . Beware as the pool is free but is NOT in the gym with the other facilities, which will charge you to enter even as a hotel guest. \\nI DOCK A STAR for any hotel mean enough to prevent you using the fridge in your room for your own drinks - this one has a warning sign on the door saying 'this is NOT a fridge, it is a minibar', warning that it has motion sensors which will charge you if you move anything - it says you can ask for a fridge for an extra charge! NO NO NO! I hate this in hotels. The minibar prices are a sick joke. Let paying guests use the in room facilities as they see fit!! Its not as if they arent paying lots of money. There is an ice machine down the corridor, a big noisy old fashioned one, not at all in keeping with the intended hip image. Must be horrid to have a room near it as its v v noisy. \\nClassic old cartoons in the lift is a cute touch.\\nThe room is v pleasant, quite cool and minimal in style, with a big TV which alas has only the basic poor US channel options, no decent US cable channels at all. You dont get a bathrobe unless you call housekeeping to specially ask for one, which I've never come across in this price bracket.. Good powerful shower\\nThe aircon/heater is quite noisy as it goes on and off through the night to maintain your chosen temp.\\nIf the location suits and you can get a decent off season deal then this is a good bet, but they would be better dropping the false attempts to be hip and concentrate on sensible things like an entrance you can spot , a fridge the paying room guests can use, better tv channel selection, internet without extortionate charges etc.\\nNever ate anything here so can't comment - breakfast is readily found in local deli/cafes. Excelente servicio, camas super king size que no te da ganas levantarte comodisímas. El desayuno tiene fama de ser uno de los mejores de la ciudad muy completo y variado, como en todos los hoteles de ee.uu siempre se paga aparte si no sueles comer demasiado no conviene por el precio que rondara los 28usd. es muy completo con show cooking!. Tiene el hotel además una zona muy informal ,de hamburguesas con una decoración muy original, son caseras muy buenas y de hecho viene gente de fuera a comer y cenar,lo recomiendo!!!tiene 2 entradas por la puerta de atrás esta el rockefeller center y el local tan famoso hooters. Un hotel bien situado y cómodo, está muy cerca de Times Square y de Central Park sin el bullicio de una avenida, habitaciones grandes, aunque un poco caro para mi opinión, lo mejor es la hamburguesería que hay en recepción, recomendaría este hotel si se coge a buen precio. superbe hotel, un emplacement idéal chambre spacieuse donnant sur central park de plus petit restaurant ou ils font les meilleurs hamburger de NY ! je l'ai testé et j'avoue qu'il sont très bon ! \\npiscine interieur, personnel de l'hotel super nous n'avons pris qu'une fois le petit dejeuné et en chambre : cottage cheese fruit vienoiserie vous pouvez choisir differente formule ! Hotel in posizione centralissima, a pochi minuti a piedi da Central Park, 5a Strada, e soprattutto vicinissimo a tutti i negozi \"in\" per lo shopping!!!!!!!! All'ultimo piano si gode una vista spettacolare su buona parte della città. Le camere sono molto spaziose e moderne molto graziose e pulite. Il personale molto gentile. Essendo in una grande città non abbiamo optato per la colazione in quanto uscendo dalla parte chiamiamola \"posteriore\" dell'hotel e quindi sulla 57th Street di fronte c'è un negozietto dove fanno delle colazioni molto abbondanti e con tutto quello che vuoi, e il costo è ridotto. Cet hôtel a été choisi pour son emplacement, le rapport prix de sa catégorie et le fait qu'il y avait une piscine.\\nNous n'avons pas été déçu de notre choix;\\nChambre réservée vue Central Park: attribution 26ème étage et la vue est là.\\nDeuxième séjour, attribution 41ème étage, rien à redire. Nous avions fait cette demande au check-out et le réceptionniste avec un large sourire nous a répondu que nous pouvions compter sur lui et ce fut le cas.\\nL'hôtel est ce que l'on appelle un gros porteur et pourtant on ne se sent pas perdu. Le personnel de la réception est chaleureux et à l'écoute. jamais l'impression de déranger.\\nPiscine très bien, personnel aussi agréable. Effectivement, c'est payant 10 dollars si vous êtes seul, 15 dollars pour ce qu'il appellent une occupation de \"multiples\".\\nChambre propre, mais sans charme.Le spectacle étant à votre fenêtre. Tre notti e la quarta improponibile ci hanno chiesto 550 dollari per una doppia senza colazione! comunque se' trovate delle offerte tramite dei tour andateci non e' per niente male! le stanze sono grandi, pulite, con tutto quello che serve tranne internet quella si paga ed e' anche cara.\\nLa posizione e' centralissima non male, con i 40 piani si gode anche di una bella vista oppure come dalla nostra stanza di un bellissimo grattacielo in ristrutturazione.\\nBuona anche la colazione e non male la spa! e la piscina all' ultimo piano. Hotel in posizione strategica a pochi minuti a piedi da Times Square e con vista mozzafiato dal 42° piano su Central Park. Ingresso e struttura abbastanza moderni, camere un pò meno, ma comunque molto grandi, pulite ed accoglienti. Il personale è stato molto gentile ed ospitale. Unica piccola pecca: colazione abbondante ma solo di tipo americano se servita all'ultimo piano con vista su Central Park. Presenza di piscina, wi-fi gratuito nella hall, starbuck's di fronte all'albergo per avere un caffè un pò più europeo e sfruttare la loro connessione wi fi gratuita. 地下鉄の駅からもすぐ、五番街や有名レストランも多くある便利な立地ですが、\\nここのポイントは、スタッフ皆さんが親切でNYらしからぬホスピタリティーを受けられました。\\nお部屋は28平米とそんなに広くはありませんが、モダンで清潔感があり気持ちよく滞在できました。\\nまた一番のポイントは窓からセントラルパークが望めることで、仕事をしたコンフォートデスクの正面に\\n窓があるので、気持ちよく仕事もできました。\\n※ホテル内、バーガーショップもおいしかったのでお勧めです。 bella scelta ,posizione invidiabile ,personale molto gentile ,trovato una receptionist italiana (viviana ) che mi ha dato ottimi consigli ,da provare gli hamburger del bar al piano terra \\nsuggerisco piano alto per vista Nous sommes revenus à New York et avons séjourné une troisième fois dans cet hotel. Quand vous n'avez pas vu sur Central Park la vue n'est pas très agréable: vue sur un immeuble en construction et un énorme climatiseur qui fait beacoup de bruit. Pour les enfants vous aurez surement le droit à un lit de camps, le mobilier est minime et la décoration inexcistante.\\nMAIS il faut le reconnaitre une très très bonne situation géographique, à quelques minutes de Central Park, de la 5ième Avenue et Times Square et du métro ce qui est fort agréable. Un personnel très gentil. \\nUn conseil: prennez le métro, qui vous plongera dans la vie New yorkaise, propre et immense il change de celui de Paris et vous promet de bons moments et de franches rigolades. Cela vous reviendra moins chèr qu'un taxi.\\nAu final un hotel qui vaut le coup pour sa situation géographique mais qui pour lui meme n'et pas le meilleur. Ottima posizione, personale gentile e disponibile, bella la struttura.\\nSiamo stati qua per i primi 5 giorni del nostro viaggio di nozze e ci siamo trovati davvero bene. La nostra camera era pulita, ampia e silenziosa. \\nConsigliato. Notevoli miglioramenti rispetto ad alcuni anni fa quando avevamo soggiornato nello stesso hotel; l'idea in effetti non ci entusiamava, ma una buona soluzione tariffaria, in un hotel comunque non economico ci ha riportato recentemente. Abbiamo trovato le camere più spaziose, adatte anche ad ospitare il rolloway bed comodamente....cosa non facile a New York. Non male l'arredamento di tipo moderno, ma si apprezza l'insonorizzazione sull'esterno e anche quella abbastanza buona sull'interno. Molto bello l'LCD per quel che lo si può usare, manca però il bollitore! Il bagno manca un po' di praticità...la vasca poteva essere sostituita da una doccia con un notevole risparmio di spazio da destinare magari allo sconosciuto bidè! Prenotato senza utilizzare agenzia, ma direttamente dal sito.\\nPer informazioni varie ho telefonato al numero verde e sono stati gentili, anche nell'accontentarmi sulla camera: una corner al 43esimo piano.\\nCamera molto buona, unico appunto alla finestra del bagno, non in buone condizioni.\\nInsonorizzazione sufficiente: certo, nonostante il 43esimo piano, si sentivano tutti i rumori del traffico (ambulanze, allarmi, spazzini etc etc). Personalmente non mi infastidiscono. Nessun rumore proveniente da altre stanze.\\nBuona scelta di giornali alla porta il mattino.\\nAscensori abbastanza veloci, se doveste annoiarvi vi potete sempre guardare i cartoni animati che vengono proiettati 24/7 negli lcd degli ascensori!\\nNel complesso è stato positivo: ma se cercate una sistemazione per dormire senza pretese, troverete altro a prezzo più basso. J'ai aimé mon séjour au Parker. Situé à 2 rues de Central Park et près de Colombus Circle, la 5ieme avenue à deux pas. Bonne ambiance au bar mais les Cosmopolitain à 18$ c'est mon seul bémol. On avait une chambre avec 2 lits trois quarts au lieu de queen comme prévu sur leur site de réservation ALL STAFFS ARE VERY KIND AND FULL OF HOSPITARITY.\\nTHANK YOU FOR ALL..\\n従業員の方たちが実に親切でした。レセプションのスタッフ、コンシェルジュ、レストランの受付、ポーター、部屋のメンテナンスの方たちを含め実に気持ち良い対応をしてもらいました。\\n部屋はジュニアスイートでしたが、合計4人で利用しましたが、2名は子供とはいえ、少し狭いのが唯一の難点。とにかく使いやすいホテルでした。 soggiornato in questo hotel ultima settimana di luglio con famiglia 2 adulti 2 bambini 8 e 11 anni\\nPregi:ottima posizione,centralissima e vicino a tutto, hamburgeria presente nell'hotel ottima anche se non bellissimo l'ambiente,personale gentilissimo e premuroso.Ottima piscina sui tetti ovviamente al chiuso ma molto interessante nei momenti di relax( non gratis costa 15 $ a camera),wi fi free solo nella hall. dIfetti: stanza piccola pur avendo prenotato una junior suite e bagno molto piccolo.Colazione in hotel molto cara come tutti gli alberghi di NY e non particolarmente ricca\\nPur essendo al 5 piano davanti ad entrata principale albergo ottima insonorizzazione,sul lato opposto stanno costruendo un albergo e sembra ci sia piu rumore. Difficile de ne pas être conquis par cet hôtel cosy, a l'épicentre de toutes les visites a réaliser a Manhattan...\\nQuelques points péjoratifs a signaler : petit déj gargantuesque mais hors de prix, pas de connexion internet gratuite, piscine du toit Payante++ (15$ par jour) sauf avec certaines réservations d'agence de voyage...rien de rédhibitoire :)\\nAprès, vous pouvez vous jeter dans la jungle urbaine et body-buildingée avec une bonne paire de baskets...et revenir régulièrement si vous le désirez effectuer une halte dans la chambre, déposer les achats par exemple...NY n'est clairement par contre, pas du tout une ville bon marché et vous allez devoir prendre l'habitude de TOUT payer régulièrement! Le rêve américain ! Globalement c'est un bon hôtel, même si nous n'avons pas testé la restauration. Les chambres sont agréables et bien équipées, le personnel est très aimable. L'immeuble en construction juste à côté de l’hôtel n'est pas très gênant, même si les travaux commencent à 7h du matin.\\nLe seul petit point noir est que lorsque vous réservez pour 3 personnes dans la même chambre vous vous attendez à ce qu'il y est des vrais lits, comme c'est généralement le cas aux USA et non pas un lit d'appoint. Meridien , un bon hotel a recommander . Parfois un besoin de renovation dans les chambres , mais dans l ensemble c 'est tres bien . remarquablement place pres de Central Park , Tout est a proximite.\\nExcellent petit dejeuner , mais un peu cher . \\nTout se paye en plus ...\\nAttention , le Minibar n 'est pas un refrigerateur , cela surrprend , sauf les amateurs de biere tiede. Hotel tres correcte , frequente par une majoritecd europeensc et francais \\nDemander chambreven etages eleves pour voir central,park\\nLe gros plus c est aussi le celebre burgerjoin un restaurant de hamburgers super planqueva lavreception a droite derriere unrideau rouge\\nPscievsur le toit sympa restaurant et arvimpersonnel 場所もかなり便利なところにあり、ＮＹのホテルにしてはかなり広さがありました。\\nお風呂もバスタブが広く、お湯を張ることもできました。\\n1階のハンバーガーショップのハンバーガーも美味しかったです。\\nごはんの時間帯には行列ができていました。\\nひとつ難点は帰りのタクシーがつかまえづらかったことです。\\n少し価格が高いですが、また宿泊したいホテルです。 le Parker Meridien est un tres bon hotel 4* ou nous descendons souvent, tres bien situé (pres de central park, quelques blocs de times square), excellent accueil, les vues des chambres sont souvent tres jolies vue sur central park, et la piscine au dernier etage est une pure merveille,nager dans les nuages entre les building est une pure merveille à faire au moins une fois. Das Le Parker Meridien ist ein schönes Hotel in Manhatten mit Blick auf den Central Park. Um diesen vom Zimmer aus zu geniesen, sollte man versuchen ein Zimmer in den oberen Etagen zu bekommen, und dann natürlich mit Blick auf den Park. Als SPG Platinum wollte man mir zunächst ein normales Zimmer geben, als ich dann aber um eine hohe Etage gebeten hatte, wurde mir dieser Wunsch erfüllt und auch gleich in eine Juniorsuite umgewandelt. Die Bar in der Eingangshalle ist recht nett, aber nichts besonderes. Das Hotel kann man von zwei Seiten aus betreten. Premetto che questa è la terza volta che soggiorniamo in questo hotel dal giugno 2011 e sinceramente credo che abbiano cambiato manager o altro perchè a nostro avviso è peggiorato.\\nAbbiamo chiesto in fase di prenotazione a marzo 2012 (viaggio 20/29 giugno 2012) 2 camere vista parco vicine ma all'arrivo una era al 29 piano e l'altra al 39 chissà perchè ,accappatoio in camere va richiesto ogni giorno altrimenti non lo mettono, la piscina pergli ospiti dell'albergo a pagamento (25 dollari) le camere poi niente di che, bagno minuscolo insomma cambiare va bene ma in meglio non in peggio Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per 4 giorni. La stanza è molto ampia e luminosa. Dotata di servizi comodi e frigo bar. Alla parete c'è un per 42 pollici ultra piatto.\\nTutto ultra pulito. Personale molto professionale e disponibile a soddisfare qualunque richiesta.\\nSicuramente un punto a favore di questa struttura è la posizione centralissima che permette di girare Manhattan tranquillamente a piedi.\\nLa colazione è abbondante e ricca, ma non a buffet.\\nSicuramente da consigliare al 100% Ho soggiornato quattro notti al Parker Meridien nell'agosto 2010. La stanza era pulita e spaziosa. Bella la piscina al 42esimo piano, con vista splendida. Personale molto cortese: una sera, verso le 23, avevamo bisogno di una coperta in più ed hanno prontamente soddisfatto la nostra richiesta. La posizione, poi, è ottima. Al mattino presto mi piaceva uscire da sola a fare una passeggiata sulla quinta strada che a piedi è proprio vicinissima. Non mi dispiacerebbe tornarci. Hôtel assez bien situé (à 10-15 minutes à pied de Time square, à 5 minutes de Central Park).\\nPropre.\\nCher par rapport à ce qui est proposé. Mais enfin, les prix à New York sont chers... Après le petit déj est en (très gros supplément), la piscine en supplément...\\nLe design n'est pas bluffant, un peu vieillot peut-être. 乗り継ぎ便の関係でニューヨークに一泊することになり、ついでにブロードウェーでミュージカルを堪能することにして、徒歩圏内のホテルということでいくつかの中からた選びました。ここはスターウッド系列らしく（シェラトンやウェスティンなどのホテルグループ）、セントラルパークが見えるツインベッドの部屋を希望していたので、日本国内で電話予約が可能で、細かいリクエストやある程度のクレームにも対応してもらえそうだったので決めました。お値段はそれなりでしたが、マンハッタンは世界一ホテル代がかさむらしいですし、最終日の疲れや夜行動することを考えれば、リーズナブルではないかと感じました。お部屋はシンプルなつくりでやや古さが感じられましたが、清潔感は保たれていたので特に不満は感じませんでした。部屋からのセントラルパークの眺めを楽しみつつ名物（？）のハンバーガーをほおばっていました。 Hotel bien situé avec une belle vue sur central park. \\nEn revanche, pas à la hauteur d'un 4 étoiles. \\nLa chambre est petite, la literie mauvaise, la salle de bain minuscule et en mauvais état (inutile d'espérer trouver des peignoirs et chaussons, même si vous avez payé le prix fort), le personnel à peine aimable. \\nLa piscine est payante (même si vous comptez faire un plongeon relaxant). \\nLe petit déjeuner est à la carte, très cher mais délicieux. Les serveurs s'impatientent si vous ne parlez pas bien anglais... \\nAttention, j'ai demandé la monnaie sur 20 dollars et on m'a rendu sur 10 à la réception de l'hotel... C'est grave pour un 4 étoiles... Niet het meest goedkope hotel in New York, maar wel één van de mooiste. Onze kamer had een uitzicht op Central Park, de mensen waren ontzettend behulpzaam, de kamer waren netjes en schoon en de bar beneden heel gezellig. De ligging is ook geweldig en ook al zit je midden in de drukte, je merkt er niets van. Zeker een aanrader. Hôtel très bien situé, à 5 minutes au sud de Central Park, à 10 minutes de Times Square, à 5 minutes de la 5ième avenue. Junior Suite pour une famille de 4 dont 2 ados très agréable au 22ième étage (très calme). Vous pouvez demander d'être le plus haut possible. Personnel serviable et certains sont francophones. Une piscine au 43 ième étage ouverte de 6h à 22h45 en semaine, 8h-20h45 le week-end(15 dollars par jour par famille). Au rez de chaussée, un petit resto de Hamburgers excellents mais souvent il y a la queue. Un lobby pour utiliser Internet gratuitement. Sinon payant dans les chambres (15 dollars par 24 h). Je recommande de prendre le petit-déjeuner autour de l'hôtel, les cafés ne manquent pas (Starbuck et autres) et c'est plus raisonnable. Proximité de toutes les lignes de métro. Nous sommes enchantés de l'hôtel et de New York: voyage sensationnel! Ce bel hôtel est propre et bien situé tout proche de central park et de la 5 th avenue et de time square.Idéal pour bien découvrir Manhattan et faire du shopping. Le plus , une piscine, située au dernier étage, propre avec vue sur central park mais payante ( 15 $ par chambre ),non mentionné sur les différents sites. Le personnel est très hospitalier et serviable.Pour le petit-déjeuner, il y a plusieurs possibilités juste à coté de l'hôtel (starbuck café, petit restaurant ouvert dés le matin , épicerie).\\nLes chambres sont propres,la décoration est soignée, la salle de bain est de taille correcte (serviettes et produits de bains renouvelés tous les jours ). L'insonorisation des chambres est tout à fait correcte . En bref,nous sommes satisfait de notre séjour dans cet hôtel et New York est une destination à faire même avec des enfants (5 ans) !!! Hotel che conferma la qualità della catena Starwood. Posizione centrale tra Central Park e Time Square. Vi consiglio la camera con vista su Central Park. Ottimo servizio e pulizia. Un pò troppo lenti gli ascensori che portavano al nostro piano. Piscina a pagamento con vista sulla città. Non abbiamo mai fatto colazione o mangiato in hotel per vivere meglio Manhattan. \\nLo consiglio sia a coppie che a famiglie. Wir hatten einen freundlichen Empfang, relativ kurze Wartezeit für New Yorker Hotels. In der Lobby wie häufig viel Betrieb. Als SPG Platinum Members gab es ein upgrade zu einer Junior Suite, modern ganz in Ordnung aber wie oft in New York nicht wirklich sauber. Das Badezimmer überraschend gross!! Die Lage des Hotels natürlich gut...das Frügstück ( hochgelobt ) völlig normal, überteuert und in einem \"sterilen Restaurant\"...eigentlich nicht zu empfehlen. Das Le Parker schon...je nachdem welchen Zimmer-Tarif man erwischt Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut, wie bei vielen Hotels zwischen Times Square und Central Park. Das Le Parker liegt nahe dem Central Park , nahe der 5th Avenue sodass vieles zu Fuss erreicht werden kann. Wie in den meisten New Yorker Hotels ist die Lobby Atmosphäre wie auf dem Hauptbahnhof. Der Empfang war nett, als SPG Platinum erhielten wir ein upgrade zu einer Executive Suite, modern , zweckmässig. Das Badezimmer gross für NY Verhältnisse und modern eibgerichtet. Die Sauberkeit liess zu wünschen übrig, übrigens kennen wir das aus NY nichts anders in diesen Hotel Kategorien ( Sheraton/ Westin / Le Meridien ) . Das Frühstück im Hotel war überraschend gut, wie immer etwas fett wie üblich aber in Ordnung. Der Frühstücksraum steril , ungemütlich. Für einen Zimmerpreis von 299 $ mit Frühstück waren wir ganz zufrieden und das zur Osterzeit . Die Preise in New Yorker Hotels variieren ja extrem. \\nInsgesamt waren wir ganz zufrieden und können das Hotel empfehlen!! メリディアンといえば一応高級の部類に入るブランドで、実際結構とりますが、結構年季が入っているのを、一応一所懸命改装やメンテしてるって感じ。ホント、相変わらずニューヨークのホテルは高いですね。ミッドタウンど真ん中の便利な場所だし仕方ないですが。\\nエレベーターとか古いです。ただ室内はモダンにまとめてるので、部屋に帰ってしまえば特に問題は無し。\\nここは朝食が名物で、結構口コミサイトの類でえらい上位ランクになってます。休日の朝とか、外から訪れる人も含め大混雑。パンケーキとかエッグベネディクトとか、アメリカ人が喜びそうなすごい盛り付けでやってきます。ま、旅の風情として結構楽しいです。仕事の前だとこんなに朝から食べたら苦しくて何もやる気なくなっちゃいますが（苦笑）\\n無難にちゃんとしたホテルだけど値段考えれば当たり前、星三つかなとも思いつつ、NY値段はしょうがないので四つということで。 Ce bel hôtel est conforme au standard Méridien, infrastructure et services. Il est au centre de \"tout\" ce qui est particulièrement appréciable. Les chambres et les SdB sont d'une taille très correcte pour NYC. La décoration est soignée. Le service est prévenant et une partie du personnel parle français. La conciergerie est particulièrement efficace. L'insonorisation est bonne et il n'y a plus de travaux dans la rue comme j'ai pu le lire avant mon départ dans les autres avis. La piscine au 42ème offre une vue superbe, dommage qu'il faille débourser 15$ pour y accéder suite à des aménagements. Elle n'est donc plus gratuite comme cela est indiqué sur de nombreux sites. Le petit déjeuner est délicieux mais le prix prohibitif (à faire une fois) environ 45$, sinon Starbuck et Dean Deluca juste en face. Il faut absolument gouter au meilleur burger de NYC situé dans l'hôtel au \"Burger Joint\", et comme c'est bon il y a souvent de l'attente. 1Fフロント横のハンバーガー目当てで、4月に夫婦で宿泊しました。パークビューの窓からの眺めは写真の通り素晴らしい。ハンバーガーを部屋食できるので、ここに宿泊で正解だなと思いました。冷めたら残念ですし、店内は…個人的に落ち着いて味わいたい人向けでない雰囲気です。客室はスリッパ無し、寝間着無し、歯ブラシ無し、勿論シャワートイレ無し、更にコインランドリー無しとアメリカハイソ向けスタンダードといった感じですが、全体的にお洒落な印象でした。宿泊時のアメニティは、PeterThomasRothのShampoo／Conditioner／Body Lotion／石けんで、香りも良し（個人差）。スーツケースが重めな方は、空港との移動にシャトルバンのネット手配をお勧めします。 Paramos en este hotel en un viaje al US Open. El hotel es muy lindo, pero no se puede soportar el ruido y la vibracion de la construccion de al lado. nos ofrecieron hacer un upgrade por una habitacion que no sea ruidosa, por la cual nos hicieron pagar 200 U/S dolares extra por noche. El desayuno es carisimo y nunca hay lugar. El olor a hamburguesa en el lobby de entrada es desagradable Geniale Lage neben Carnegiehall, um die Ecke zum Central Park, Broadway, MoMa.... Frühstück im Hotel meiden! Tolle Cafes überall ringsum zum Frühstücken. Unbedingt die Burger im Hotel probieren! Klasse Service,freundlich und hilfsbereit. Zimmer sehr sauber, nicht hellhörig! Ausblick vom Pool genießen, der ist kostenlos! Schwimmen kostet!\\nAlles in Allem: Grandios, sehr zu empfehlen! Non avevo mai soggiornato a midtown e già questa è stata una piacevole scoperta. L'hotel è vicinissimo a parecchi luoghi interessanti e a molti punti nevralgici di New York: Central Park, Columbus Circle, Times square, MoMA, Rockefeller center. Tutto sommato, siamo riusciti ad arrivare a piedi anche all'Empire state building e al Metropolitan museum. L'albergo è molto confortevole, il personale cortese, il servizio celere e preciso. Bello il bar vicino all'entrata sulla 57ª, mentre la lobby è sulla 56ª. Non ci sono ristoranti in senso tradizionale, ma ottimi hamburger da Burger Joint e ottime colazioni da Norma's. Suggerisco le camere su Central Park: dal 25º piano in su la vista è fantastica. La camera standard è ampia, così come il bagno. Arredamento semplice e moderno, con ottimi spazi. Pratica la scrivania, comodi i letti. Mia moglie e io non avevamo molta roba, ma per chi si porta tanti vestiti non sarebbe sgradito qualche cassetto in più e un armadio più grande. Oltre a un paio di appendiabiti vicino alla porta (ma perché molti alberghi non li mettono? Lo spazio non manca). Prezzi in linea con quelli di midtown e con la categoria, per una settimana la stanza ci è costata quasi 2000 euro, comprese tasse, imposta di soggiorno e tutto quanto. Dieses Hotel gehört zweifellos an die Spitze. Der Filme in den Aufzug zu den schönen Zimmern mit modernen Farben und einem Swimmingpool und Blick auf das Dach. Beachten Sie, dass der Fitnessraum im Hotel zusätzliche Kosten entstehen (wie alles andere in dieser Stadt) und wird von Einheimischen frequentiert.\\n Auch die Restaurants in der Lobby sehr beschäftigt und es könnte schneller sein, um Ihr Glück anderswo zu bekommen.\\n Die Zimmer sind überraschend ruhig und groß ist, ist es nicht optimal für diesen Standort in der Nähe des Central Park ist extrem selten. Hôtel très bien situé, idéale pour découvrir Manhattan: 10 min à pieds de Times square, 5 min de Central Park , de la 5th Avenue et de Rockfeller Center. Les chambres sont confortables , il faut demander une chambre dans les étages supérieurs au 20ème étage pour bénéficier de la vue sur Central Park. Cependant, l'équipement comme la Télé ne sont pas Hi tech et les fenêtres mal isolées.Le personnel est très hospitalier et serviable, à la réception quelques employées parlent français.La piscine située au dernier étage dégage une vue imprenable sur la ville surtout la nuit c'est magnifique. Le petit resto est réputé pour les meilleurs hamburgers de NY mais franchement c'est pas le cas, de plus il y a une file d'attente interminable, si vous voulez manger allez y quelques min avant l'ouverture.Pour le petit déjeuner , vous trouverez un StarBucks juste en face sinon il y a pleins de petits resto à proximité qui en propose.Une astuce les croissants de la superette Duane Reade sont très bons et pas chers et en plus ils sont énormes.\\nEn bref nous sommes satisfait de notre séjour dans cet hôtel surtout pour la proximité des lieux principaux de NY. 毎回ジュニアスイートに宿泊致しました。\\n寝室と居間があるのでそれなりに広さを感じます。\\n多分部屋の広さは50～60㎡弱ではないでしょうか。\\nソファーも通常のソファーと窓越しに固定設定されたソファーがあり\\nソファーが多く、ゆったりできます。 Per cinque notti ho soggiornato con mio figlio in questo hotel consigliatomi da amici e, pur essendovi di meglio in città quanto a lusso, a immagine e a soluzioni più \"trendy\", riconosco di aver trovato cortesia, efficienza, pulizia, buone dotazioni extra, come ad esempio la gradevole piscina panoramica non frequente in alberghi anche molto più acclamati. L'accoglienza è stata cortese ma impersonale,la stanza piccola ma efficiente, come pure il minuscolo bagno. i letti comodi. La posizione agli ultimi piani consentiva di avere una bellissima vista su Central Park nonostante l'hotel non fosse posizionato in prima linea su Central Park South dove si trovano grandi hotel prestigiosi. Particolarmente soddisfacente il breakfast che non era a buffet ma servito alla carta con buona scelta di cibi caldi e freddi, dolci e salati preparati con cura e ben serviti. Si diceva tra l'altro che l'hotel è famoso e premiato proprio per la migliore colazione della città e la sala breakfast era infatti sempre piuttosto affollata ad ogni ora. La posizione infine è conveniente per il centro, la metropolitana e per la particolarità che l'hotel , occupando un intero block, ha due accessi: dalla 56esima e dalla parallela 57esima il che rende più comodo ritrovarlo arrivando da una parte e dall'altra,\\nLe informazioni dei due concierge, consultati una sola volta, sono state rapide ma cortesi. Il portiere, infine, fischiando con molta determinazione, ha poi trovato in pochi secondi un taxi per condurci alla stazione ferroviaria. Zimmer 2128\\nverhältnismässig ruhig, da 21.

La Blanqueria del cuarto\\n muy linda y siempre limpia... La vista que nos toco no fue muy linda...\\nNo tuvimos la oportunidad pero sabiamos que en la terraza habia una pileta climatizada con una vista increible al Central Park.\\nEn el lobby hay una casa de hamburguesas que dicen que son riquisimas, siempre habia cola en el lobby para comprarlas. Abbiamo pernottato dal 16 al 20 febbraio riscontrando nella stanza un arredamento funzionale, servizio camera ottimo, disponibilità del personale della hall.\\nLa posizione dell'albergo è ottima, essendo vicina a Time Square, al Central Park e volendo è possibile raggiungere facilmente gli ingressi alla metropolitana.\\nL'idea di creare un luogo di ristorazione per giovani all'interno dell'albergo, come alternativa più economica al ristorante, è lodevole, non tantp lo spazio attribuitogli. Estuvimos en nuestra luna de miel, es un hotel bonito y bueno... excelente localización.\\nAunque me decepcionó la vista que teníamos desde la habitación, supongo que hubiese sido fácil de solucionar si hubiésemos pedido una habitación con vistas.\\nNos dejaron fresas con chocolate y una botella de champange.\\nEs cierto que los armarios tienen una cortina como puerta, pero no queda tan mal.\\nEl baño es pequeño, pero decente.\\nLa habitación era amplia y la cama muy cómoda. superbe chambre , avec vue sur central park a 3 minutes pied , faut essayer les amberger de la place , tres typique et pitoreste mais tellement bon \\nje la recommande sans hesiter A un paso de 5th Ave. y de Central Park. Hotel moderno, bien cuidado y con precios (para su nivel en Manhattan) no excesivamente desmesurados. Cuenta entre sus instalaciones con una piscina cubierta bastante aparente. La decoración es funcional y las habitaciones muy cómodas. Preferible las plantas más altas. hotel gradevole : accoglienza ottima , gestione informazioni ottima gentile \\ncamera essenziale ricambio biancheria giornaliera \\nposizione ottima sia per i trasferimenti ( aeroporti ) sia per i percorsi turistici ( 5° strada a due isolati ) subway a pochi passi , central park a disposizione \\nbuono il ristorante anche se un po' caro rispetto alla media Hôtel très bien situé, proche de Central Park, de la 5th Avenue, de Broadway et du Rockfeller Center. Idéal pour partir à la découverte de Manhattan en famille.\\nLes chambres pour 4 personnes sont bien équipés et très agréable. Le service est agréable et de bonne qualité. Le personnel de la réception est disponible et compétent.\\nUne très belle piscine sur le toit (agréable le soir après une bonne journée de marche et idéal avec des enfants).\\nCôté restauration, le bar à Hamburger à très bien (très simple mais très bon, à faire une fois). Pour le petit déjeuner, ne pas hésiter à sortir pour le prendre à l'extérieur à l'exception du brunch car le NORMA'S est réputé pour son brunch du dimanche (réservation obligatoire même si on réside à l'hôtel). Beaucoup de restaurants à proximité de l'hôtel voir dans Central Park (le midi).\\nNous y reviendrons c'est certain. El hotel muy bien ubicado, entre la 6 y la 7 avenida. Moderno, con una hamburguesería excelente y un lobby bar muy bueno. Lo único malo es que están de obras en el edificio de al lado, lo estas construyendo. Así que echadle un par de años, por lo menos de trabajo. Íbamos en grupo y nos dieron la quinta planta. Imaginar el ruido de la perforadora antes de las siete de la mañana!! Pedimos cambio y nos dijeron que juntas no iban a tener y que eran peores habitaciones, y nos querian cobrar 100 dolares por noche por ser habitaciones en plantas altas!!!!! les dijimos que nos era indiferente pero queríamos cambio, y que no íbamos a pagar por poder dormir, ya que donde estábamos era imposible, las obras van de 7h a 16h, nos dieron separados pero en la planta 15 y 22. Si sabes lo del ruido, no pongas a los clientes en la 5planta, o igual es por si cuela y no se quejan, pero vaya!, Pero supongo que será como en todos los hoteles depende del de recepción que te toque, porque luego conocimos a un recepcionista llamado Rafael, hispano que nos trato de maravilla. Así que si vais, directamente preguntar por el, porque los chicos de recepción, :(. En fin quitando ese percance por lo demás bien, limpio, agradable, la piscina muy bien. Y la zona también. Recomendable Ho soggiornato in questo hotel a marzo 2011 con mio marito che era a NY per un viaggio di lavoro, mentre io ne ho approfittato per visitare la citta'.\\nMi ritengo soddisfatta di questo hotel: la camera era spaziosa e il letto comodo. Il bagno, invece, era un po' deludente.\\nIl plus di questa sistemazione, in ogni caso, e' dato dalla location, davvero comoda a due passi dalla 5th Av, Central Park e Times Square.\\nHo, inoltre, apprezzato il fast food all'interno dell'hotel, che si dice prepari uno dei migliori hamburger di NY e che in un paio di occasioni si e' rivelato un'ottima soluzione per la cena. Das beste vom Parker ist die Lage und der Gym (wobei fuer den diesen noch extra zahlen muss). Heraussragend ist das Frühstück im Normas. Ein besseres gibt es in New York nicht. Die Zimmer sind dafür enttäuschend und wenn man Pech hat, wartet man ewig, bis der richtige Aufzug kommt. Die Anzahl der Zimmer und die Höhe des Gebäudes hätte mehr Aufzüge nötig. Sauberkeit ist ok. Service sehr amerikanisch (freundlich aber oberflächig). Insgesamt -obwohl ich ein Fan von Meridien bin- leider nur befriedigend. Siamo appena ritornati da un soggiorno di 3 notti in questo albergo bello, pulito e accogliente.\\nLe camere sono grandi e spaziose, molto ben arredate, ed il personale è gentile e disponibile.\\nDopo aver letto le recensioni che parlavano di \"lavori in corso rumorosi \" ho chiesto una stanza non ai piani bassi. Mi è stata data una location al 14° piano assolutamente silenziosa.\\nI lavori iniziano alle 8 di mattina ma impossibile accorgersene perchè con il jet lag vi assicuro che sarete svegli e pronti per uscire già molte ore prima!\\nL'albergo è a due passi da Central Park, 5° Av., Time Square ecc , insomma posizione ideale per raggiungere in breve tempo i punti di piu' interesse tenuto anche conto che vicino c'è la fermata Metro.\\nSe dovessi tornare a NY sceglierei nuovamente questo albergo El hotel es muy bonito, con una decoración minimalista, mi habitación en un piso alto tenía unas vistas impresionantes. En la planta baja tiene una pequeña hamburgueseria muy recomendable, hay que buscarla porque está bastante escondida, suele estar a tope, para esos dias os recomiendo subirse la hamburguesa a la habitación. Siamo stati a NY a novembre 2011 e, visto che dovevamo festeggiare un evento un po' speciale volevamo soggiornare in un hotel di lusso. Dal catalogo dell'agenzia e dal prezzo che avevamo pagato ci aspettavamo un posto davvero bello e invece è stato una delusione. La hall completamente spoglia, per non dire squallida (sembrava di entrare in un magazzino), la camera ordinaria, il bagno con la porta che non si chiudeva bene, la porta del bagno con i bordi che si staccavano dall'umidità, il set di cortesia che consisteva solo nel sapone, l'armadio era costituito da una piccola nicchia chiusa da una tenda che sembrava un ripostiglio, dove c'era l'asse da stiro e la cassaforte. La presenza della cassaforte impediva di stendere bene gli abiti che così avevano sempre il bordo stropicciato. Quello che era buono di questo hotel era la posizione e la vista sulla città. eravamo al 41 piano e quindi avevamo un bel panorama, soprattutto di notte.\\nNelle stesse giornate erano a new york altri amici nostri che hanno soggiornato in un hotel a 200 metri dal nostro, a pari stelle e a metà del prezzo pagato da noi. Ci siamo pentiti della nostra scelta in quanto il loro albergo era di gran lunga migliore del nostro, sia la hall che le camere. la posizione di questo grande albergo è perfetta per chi desidera fare un giro sulla 5a! La struttura è pronta a ricevere i grandi gruppi degli operatori turistici. meno avvezzo al turista indipendente: non è prevista una figura che dia consigli utili per girare o prenotare ristoranti. il costo è quello di un albergo di lusso, ma è assente il servizio del grande albergo di lusso. Il ristorante (molto buono) chiude alle tre del pomeriggio, il servizio colazioni in camera non rispetta gli orari e nell'ultimo mese di novembre alle 7.30 del mattino ci si può svegliare con il frastuono del martello pneumatico. la struttura si scusa e garantisce la distribuzione camera per camera di tappi per le orecchie!! per il resto, il ristorantino dietro i tendoni al pian terreno che serve hamburger è delizioso (aperto anche la sera)! Das ist meine neue Lieblings-Hotel in New York, ist es in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Central Park, damit ich auch mehrere Morgen joggen bin.\\n Die Zimmer sind geräumig und modern, wirklich einfach schön.\\n Die Aufzüge sind sehr effizient und gut verteilt. Auf dem Dach befindet sich eine Terrasse mit Pool, ist die Aussicht schön, aber die Anlage kann noch modernisiert werden.\\n Wir haben auch Nutzung des Fitnessstudios und Wellness-Anlage auf USD 10 pro Tag gemacht. Das war nicht besonders in Bezug auf Wellness, sondern ein umfangreiches Fitness-Studio.\\n Das Hotel ist ziemlich beschäftigt auf der Lobby-Ebene des Restaurants Einrichtungen, auch so beschäftigt, dass wir gefrühstückt anderswo. Aber zum Glück gibt es reichlich Auswahl in New York. Los cuartos son muy agradables en estilo modernista. Ubicado a media cuadra del Carnegie Hall y a dos cuadras de Central Park sobre la 57th, prácticamente todo lo puede uno hacer caminando. Hay alberca y un gimnasio, el personal es muy amable e incluso le dan a uno sombrillas en caso de lluvia. \\nCon la enorme ventaja de que a media cuadra en la 57th hay un restaurante sensacional que se llama Mangia donde pasa uno a servirse en un plato y este lo pesan y le cobran a uno de acuerdo a ello.\\nLo que me pareció estupendo es que el check out sea hasta las 3 Von aussen ist das Hotel eine Straße hinter dem Central Park keine Offenbarung, allerdings ist es von innen wunderbar!\\nDie Aussicht auf den Central Park ist atemberaubend! Leider gab es am 13.-14.10. erheblichen Baulärm. Das Frühstück im Hotel kann man auslassen (Preis und Angebot)\\nDie Bar und die Eingangshalle sind sehenswert!\\nDas Zimmer ist geraeumig - das Bad ist modern eingerichtet Siamo stati in questo hotel per due notti nel mese di ottobre. Si trova in una posizione ottima per vedere New york, a pochi passi dalla metro, da entral Park e da Times square. Sono però assolutamente da evitare le came ai primi piani, perchè, purtroppo stanno facendo dei lavori e non si riesce a dormire. Iniziano dalle 7 del mattino e proseguono sino a sera. Inoltre le camere standard non sono un granchè, mentre le camere deluxe sono decisamente un'altra cosa. In un primo momento ci avevano messo in una camera standard, ma dato il frastuono insopportabile, abbiamo chiesto di essere trasferiti in una camera migliore, siamo finiti al 31 piano, in una deluxe, tutta un'altra cosa. Per la colazione, nessun problema, di fronte c'è uno Starbucks. Sicuramente non è economico! nous avions une chambre vue central park au 37ème étage. Chambre un peu petite mais la literie est d'excellente qualité. Salle de bain assez étroite mais largement dotée en serviettes, shampoing, gel douche...seul problème mais de taille : les travaux de marteaux piqueurs qui vous réveillent tous les jours à 7h00 pétante (9h00 la samedi et rien le dimanche). c'est hyper désagréable car le bruit est réellement assourdissant (impossible presque de se parler dans le hall de réception). Bien sûr aucune info en amont de la part de l'hotelier pas plus qu'un prix \"discounté\" pour compenser ce désagrément. Piscine trés agréable au 41ème étage avec des plages d'ouverture trés larges. Hotel trés bien placé pour point de départ des visites Manhattan. Prenez le petit déjeuner au star buck en façe Wir hatten dieses Hotel über Hotwire gebucht und wirklich ein Schnäppchen gemacht. Für 109 Euro pro Nacht bekamen wir ein tolles Zimmer mit Blick auf den Central Park. Die Zimmer sind recht groß, sehr hell und auch sehr gemütlich. Wir hatten ein paar Probleme mit der Aircon und auf Nachfrage bekamen wir dann einen Heizlüfter ins Zimmer gestellt. Das war schon supernett. Das Internet kostete (17 $ Tag), klappte aber überhaupt nicht. Wir hatten kein Frühstück, aber in NY ist das ja kein Problem, da es Kaffee an jeder Ecke gibt. Toll ist der Pool im obersten Stockwerk. Gerade bei Nacht hat meinen einen tollen Blick Richtung City und Richtung Central-Park. Beliebt scheint auch die winzige Burger-Bar zu sein - wir haben aber nur einen Blick reingeworfen. U-Bahn Eingänge und Bushaltestellen sind in der Nähe. Ich würde wieder dort übernachten. Voyage du 8 au 13 octobre 2011.\\nEffectivement ce n'est pas le moment de réserver une chambre vue sur Central Park ! La chambre (pour nous au 34ème étage) était très mal insonorisée. Le vent sifflé dans les fenêtres + les travaux dès le matin 7h avec des bruits de marteaux piqueurs ! Pas idéal pour les vacances !\\nSinon l'hôtel est très bien situé par rapport à Times square et Central Park.\\nPour info, par rapport au prix du petit déjeuner, il est possible de l'acheter à l'extérieur et de le ramener dans les chambres.\\nLa chambre était spacieuse mais la salle de bain trop étroite, pas de peignoir mais assez de serviettes pour 2 dans notre cas.\\nBon séjour à vous à New York, pour nous ça reste un très bon souvenir! Nous avons séjourné au Parker du 10 au 14 oct 2011. L'hôtel n'a plus rien des fastes des séjours que j'avais connus dans les années 80 et 90, quand il était français et luxueux. Il n'est plus français ni luxueux: les salles de bains paraissent incroyablement exigues face à la concurrence, il ne faut pas séjourner trop longtemps faute de savoir où installer ses vêtements puisque l'essentiel de la chambre est occupé par le meuble tournant de la TV, les peintures des portes mériteraient d'être rafraichies,etc..Sans parler des petits-déjeuners aux prix démentiels et surtout injustifiés!!!! Mais l'essentiel réside dans un chantier sur l'arrière de l'hôtel. Toutes les chambres donnant sur la 57th str. sont réveillées dès 7h par le bruit de deux excavateurs qui démolissent les fondations d'un ancien bâtiment. Ce qui va durer jusqu'à fin novembre et touche aussi des parties communes: impossible de s'entendre avec le personnel dans le lobby jusqu'à 17h-18h. Au-delà de novembre, le personnel du Meridien reste très discret mais celui du chantier laisse entendre que la reconstruction d'un nouveau bâtiment va prolonger les nuisances sans doute jusque fin 2012. Bref, il vaut mieux regarder les concurrents du voisinage, dans ce quartier qui a tout de même l'incomparable avantage d'être entre Times Square et Central Park. Sono appena tornata da NY che conosco bene. L'albergo è in un'ottima posizione, la camera non grande ma con una bella vista su Central Park, il servizio camere buono, mentre per la colazione consiglio vivamente di andare altrove ... si rischia di aspettare per un caffè anche 40 minuti! Ma la cosa veramente tremenda è stato il rumore... ci sono dei lavori in corso al piano terra e ogni mattina alle 7 precise comincia a lavorare il martello pneumatico ... eravamo al 27 piano ma non era possibile più stare nè in camera nè nell'albergo. Avrebbero dovuto almeno segnalarlo e praticare uno sconto adeguato per compensare il grande disagio provocato. Se proprio volete prenotare in questo albergo assicuratevi che i lavori siano finiti. Visitare New York non vuol dire certo alloggiare negli hotel principeschi ma credo che sia utile almeno che sia in posizione ottimale per gli spostamenti turistici che si debbono affrontare...bene per la posizione questo hotel è buono ma di certo non vale il costo della camera che si presenta ancora con la moquette e non ha alcuna bella vista sulla città...anzi!!\\nBagno piccolissimo ed ovviamento \"cieco\"! nota positiva la comodità del letto e la gentilezza della reception (in particolare Micheal). a parte questo non potrei dare altri giudizi visto che non abbiam fatto neppure un pasto all'interno della struttura (la colazione costa dai 26 ai 33 dollari). dovessimo tornare a NY andremmo sicuramente in un'altra struttura...peccato, siamo un po' delusi. El hotel está fenomenalmente ubicado y puedes ir andando a los principales puntos de interés de la ciuidad. Nuestra habitación amplia y con una decoración clásica-decadente que le dan su encanto. \\nDentro del hotel está una de las mejores hamburgueserías de la ciudad. Nunca podrías imaginar que en un hotel clásico y pudieses encontrar detrás de una puerta un garito de lo mas auténtico. \\nEstuvimos muy cómodos ルームカテゴリーをアップして、セントラルパークビューの部屋にされることをオススメします。すっきりとした部屋で清潔に保たれているという以外は特筆すべき点はありません。１階にあるハンバーガーはオススメです。朝食はとても高い割に質がともなっていないので、近くのスターバックスでニューヨークらしくベーグルとコーヒーを食べながらニューヨーカーを眺める方が楽しかったです。 Wer in New York ein solides, sauberes Hotel in guter Lage sucht ist im Le Parker Meridien gut aufgehoben. Es ist ein größerer Hotelkomplex der gewohnten Standard der Spg group bietet.\\nFür den gleichen Preis kann man manchmal aber auch schon das W buchen welches wesentlich reizvoller ist.\\nDie Zimmer sind eher klein, aber hell und sauber.\\nIm Rezeptionsbereich befindet sich als kleiner Geheimtipp, versteckt hinter einem Vorhang vor dem immer eine Menschenschlange steht eine tolle vielfach ausgezeichnete Burgerbude (es ist eher ein Verschlag der aber durchaus Charakter hat und zur Stadt passt) wo man für 6 US $ einen hervorragenden Burger bekommt. 内装のセンスの良さ、パークビューからのセントラルパークの眺め、1階ハンバーガーの美味しさ、そして5番街を始め、ＭＯＭＡ、ブロードウェイ、セントラルパークへ自由自在の徒歩圏。\\nミュージカルを夜観た後でも女性一人で不安なく徒歩で帰れます。\\nプールが最上階にあり、時差調整や少し身体を動かしたいとき、確か6時からオープンしていたと記憶していますので、次回は是非マンハッタンの空を泳ぎたいと思います。\\nただ、ひとつだけ残念だったことは、体重計がなかったことです。\\n帰国の荷物を量りたかったのですが、リクエストしても　備えていない　との返事でした。\\nでも、逆を言えばそれくらいしか難点を思いあたらないってことですね。 Quelle déception cet hôtel. La seule chose qui soit bien c'est son emplacement près de Central Park. Nous avons vue sur le Park.\\nIl n'y a pas de restaurant sauf un \"recoin burger\"… Il n'y a pas de placard pour ranger ses vêtements juste une penderie. La salle de bains est toute petite et il n'y a pas de sortie de bains, ni de mule de bains. J'ai été obligée de réclamer du shampoing, des cotons à démaquiller, des cotons tiges, etc.\\nTrès mauvais rapport qualité/prix.\\nLe personnel n'est pas aimable, non stylé.\\nLe ménage n'est pas bien fait.\\nJe ne recommande pas cet hôtel. 初めてのNY旅行ということで、アクセスのよさそうなこちらを利用させていただきました。\\n結果は大正解！５番街やセントラルパークはもちろん、タイムズスクエアなども徒歩圏内。地下鉄の駅も近く、どこへ行くにもとても便利でした。\\n　また、すぐ近くにはスタバやDEAN＆DELUCAがあり、朝食を買って毎朝ニューヨーカー気分(？)を味わっていました。\\n　部屋は清潔感があり、シャワーもとても勢いがあって心地よい水圧です。\\n　アメニティはシャンプー＆リンスと石鹸のみでしたが、海外のホテルにはありがちなことだと思うので、個人的にはそこまで気になりませんでした。(ただ、シャンプー＆リンスが一組しかなかったので、次の日にもう一組増やしてもらいました。快く応じてもらえました！)\\n　\\n　また、ホテル１階にあるハンバーガーショップはとても美味しいです！ジューシーなお肉はさすが本場！という感じです。とても気に入って、滞在中２回も食べてしまいました。\\n　今後もNY旅行の機会があれば、次回もこちらを利用したいと思います。他のみなさまの口コミを拝見していると、こちらのホテルは朝食も素晴らしいようなので、ぜひ利用してみたいです。 今回、STARWOODのホームページから予約し4泊しました。\\nハイフロアーのパークビュールーム（34階)で予約しました。\\nお部屋からの眺めはなかなか良かったです。\\n朝目が覚めて朝焼けを見ながら、セントラルパークの緑が\\nどんどん鮮やかになっていく様子がとてもきれいでした。\\nお部屋内はシンプルで使いやすかったです。アイロン台とアイロンが\\nあったのでとっても助かりました！\\n以前口コミで『冷蔵庫の誤請求』について読んでいたので警戒してましたが、\\n今回は特にそういったトラブルもなく快適に過ごすことができました。\\nどういうシステムで冷蔵庫の使用状況を確認しているのかわかりませんが、\\n私はいつもベッドメイキングのチップを枕元に置いておくときに、一言お礼の\\nメモを添えています。だからなのか、今までホテルで不快な思いをしたことが\\nあまりない気がします。\\nホテル内の朝食レストランは高いと聞いていましたが、CAFEはとっても\\n良心的な値段で夜お茶にはもってこいの場所です。コーヒー＄4でした！\\nセントラルパークが近いこともあり、朝の散歩がとても気持ち良かったです。\\n夏のニューヨークは、一歩外に出ると車や人でごった返しているので、ホテルは\\nなるべく静かな場所の方がゆっくりできると思います。\\nタイムズスクエア辺りの滞在だと、明かりがまぶしくて夜も騒々しいのでは\\nないかとおもいました。その点、セントラルパーク近くは静かなのでおすすめです！ L'hotel est très bien situé, à quelques minutes de Central Park meme pas, pouvons aller à Times Square à pieds en marchant. Petit bémol: du coté rue il y a du bruit, mieux vaut il demander une chambre avec vu sur Central Park (plus chèr) mais vraiment cela en vaut de la peine la deuxième fois été formidable avec cette vue. De plus la piscine au tout dernier étage avec un spa sur le toit vaut vraiment le cout malgré le fait que la piscine est petite en soi, le simple fait de se baigner entre les toits des grands buldings fait oublier le reste. Petits connseils: prendre son petit dejeuner au STARBUCK d'en face qui est typiquement américain. A essayer egalement le fameux restaurant situé dans le hall de l'hotel ou des burgueurs delicieux sont proposés mais y aller dès l'ouverture car énormément de monde tout le temps! 2 Blocks vom Central Park entfernt liegt das Hotel in einer Seitenstrasse. Wir hatten ein recht großes Zimmer im 21. Stock. Der Straßenlärm war also nur entfernt zu hören. Das Personal war nett, konnte/wollte allerdings die Minibar im Zimmer nicht reparieren. Bei den Minibarpreisen war das allerdings kein richtiges Problem, zumal um die Ecke ein kleiner Supermarkt und direkt gegenüber vom Hotel ein Starbucks war. Zimmer 279 USD/Nacht geht für die Qualität des Hotels. Kurz vor Abflug wäre es das Doppelte gewesen. Das rechnet sich dann nicht mehr. このホテルは何よりも立地が良いです。セントラルパークまで徒歩数分で、早朝から散歩したりして滞在中気分よく過ごすことができました。地下鉄の駅もすぐ近くに複数あり、どこに移動するのも楽ですし、スタバやドラッグストア等も近くにあります。\\n私たちが滞在した部屋は広さも十分にあって、内装もまったく問題なし。\\nまた、ホテル内のハンバーガー店も利用しました。店内はそれほど広くなくかなり混雑していましたが、宿泊客はすぐに部屋に戻って食べることができるので便利でした。 che dire di un hotel dove arrivi alle 18.30 di sera e la tua stanza non è pronta ?? \\nforse la graziosa impalcatura che copriva l'ingresso già mi aveva messo di cattivo umore, in ogni modo attendere un ora su delle panchette di legno con 3 bimbi piccoli non è stato il massimo.\\nBuona la posizione , il room service , il servizio pulizie e la piscina all'ultimo piano.\\nPolveroso l'arredamento i velluti e le moquette.\\nTutto sommato un albergo decisamente antico in un ottima posizione. A mio parere però decisamente troppo caro per quanto offre Flot hotel med god service og skøn beliggenhed tæt på Central Park og mellem Broadways teaterdistrikt på den ene side og Fifth Avenue på den anden side. Tæt på subway. Das Hotel liegt superzentral. Egal in welche Richtung man Ausflüge unternimmt, es ist alles zu Fuß super erreichbar. Außerdem gibt es ein Starbucks genau gegenüber, Kiosk, Cafes & Co. ebenfalls in wenigen Minuten erreichbar. Die Zimmer waren sauber und äußert geräumig. Leider gab es im Zimmer keine Badeschuhe und Bademantel - ansonsten hätten wir auch den Pool auf dem Dach ausprobieren können. estuvimos 5 noches en le park meridien manhattan cn mi e´posa y dos hijas, el hotel para nuestro gusto salvo la ubicacion que es excellente , en lo que es hoteleria deja mucho que desear, pongo los comentarios\\n1.- al llegar nadie recoge las maletas, tuvimos que pedir q las llevaran a la habitacion\\n2.- nadie nos acompaño ni mostro las caracteristicas del hotel ni los servicios , bar , spa, etc, desayuno\\n3.-.un dia volvimos 8 pm de paseos y los dos cuartos no estaban hechos mi hija que maneja muy bien elñ ingles hizo 4 reclamos, ni siquiera se disculparon\\n4.-el hotel comparte su acceso y hall con la famosa hamburgueseria y un acceso a un esdificio contiguo lo cual hace q siempre hay transito de gente y no tiene un hall o foyer de descanso o espera\\n5.- se ve muy poco personal en el hotel salvo la concerjeria parece mas un edificio de oficinas q hotel\\n6.- cuando hicimos el check out nos presntan unas cuentas de cosnumo de frigo bar x 77 us, les decimos q no consumimos solo pusimos a enfriar nuestras botellas de agua, se nos dice que al abrir o mover el contenido automaticamente se toma como consumo, nunca visto, siempre en toda la hoteleria q he ido se verifica el cosnumo, igualmnete no nos cobraron\\nen resumen salvo la ubicacion nada relevante Wir waren jetzt schon das vierte Mal im LeParker Meridien NY. Aufgrund der sehr zentralen Lage (W 56th str.,, direkt neben der Carnegie Hall) und der für New Yorker Verhältnisse grossen Zimmer werden wr dieses Haus auch immer wieder wählen. Die Tower-Rooms bieten einen tollen Blick in die City oder in Richtung Central Park.\\nZu den Peakzeiten ist es an der Rezeption schon mal richtig voll, aberdie Mitarbeiter sind schnell und gewandt!\\nZum Frühstück kann man ins Hotelrestaurant \"Norma\" gehen, ds ist OK, wenn auch teuer. Tip: einen Block um die Ecke gibt es das \"Mangia\", das ist unser Frühstücksrestaurant. Und für den Kaffe nach dem Austehen gibt es direkt gegenüber des Hotels eine Filiale der grossen amerikanischen Kaffeekette .\\nTaxen gibt es immer vor dem Haus, in die \"Met\" schafft man es in 15 Minuten zu Fuß.\\nUnbedingt den \"Burger Joint\" ausprobieren!\\nAchtung: es ist ein internationales Businesshotel, es ist immer Betrieb! L'albergo è ottimo anche se costa troppo e la tariffa non include l'utilizzo di internet (16 dollari al giorno..).\\nVale la pena per la posizione, la piscina riscaldata con vista mozzafiato all'ultimo piano del palazzo (splendida) e provvista di un bel servizio doccia, spogliatoio, creme, etc..\\nLe camere sono normali, belle, specialmente quelle con vista su central park.\\nRicordatevi di chiedere la camera ad un piano alto perchè in basso si sentono i rumori di costruzione di due grattacieli vicini.\\nNon fate colazione in hotel (carissima) ma allo starbucks di fronte o sull'angolo con la sesta da Zibetto (cappuccio e brioche italiani!).\\nIl servizio concierge è splendido. Sempre gentili ed efficienti anche nel prenotare i ristoranti per la sera (senza sovrapprezzo).\\nPer pranzo, almeno una volta, bisogna provare Burger Joint: splendidi amburger proprio dietro la hall. Scadente la tv ed i canali televisivi offerti. Ottimo il materasso, i cuscini e i prodotti da bagno offerti. Perfect gelegen hotel met drie (!) ingangen en van alle faciliteiten voorzien. Had een hele mooie kamer met Park View en een ruim tweepersoonsbed met een heerlijk matras. Tevens was er een minibar aanwezig, badkamer met bad, televisie en tegen een kleine vergoeding per dag kun je internetten op de kamer. Heb geen gebruik gemaakt van het ontbijt omdat ik erg vroeg op was door het tijdsverschil maar aan de overkant van het hotel zit een Starbucks waar ik 's ochtends vroeg al terecht kon voor koffie en ontbijt.\\nHet personeel is erg vriendelijk en behulpzaam en dankzij Reina van de Front Desk is mijn verblijf extra feestelijk geworden door een extra attentie welke zij op m'n kamer had laten bezorgen vanwege een speciale gelegenheid. Kortom een hele goede aanrader voor een onvergetelijk verblijf in the city that never sleeps! 119 West 56thと57th Streetの間にあり、5Avのブランド街、タイムズスクエアまで歩いて10分以内という立地のよさ。セントラルパークも部屋から眺めることが出来る。\\n最上階のプールも早朝から開いていて、宿泊客は無料で利用可能で。\\nNewyorkerの気分を味わえる\\n買い物にビジネスに最適だろう。\\nSPG会員ならば、お得に宿泊できる。\\n１Fのレストランの朝食、ロビー脇のハンバーガーショップもNYでは有名店。 Y avons séjourné 2 fois en 2 ans (une dizaine de jours chaque fois) et la qualité est toujours au rendez-vous ! Sans parler de la convivialité, du service irréprochable, de la gentillesse et de la politesse du personnel qui vous aide en toute occasion. J'adore la télé dans l'ascenseur, les couloirs \"moelleux\" et intimes, la piscine au dernier étage (un must pour débuter la journée et pour apaiser vos muscles après avoir marché pendant des heures dans cette ville extraordinaire), la vue sur Central Park, les hamburgers du Burger Joint et l'emplacement de l'hôtel (à 2 pas de Central Park et des métros).\\nOn y retournera ! Nicht nur die Lage des Parker Meridien großartig, um die Ecke des Central Parks sondern auch daß es für New Yorker Maßstab große Zimmer hat.Das Zimmer war geräumig und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Das Hotelteam und der Service waren sehr kompetent und freundlich. Jedes mal wieder sehr gerne in Parker Meridien. うわさでは聞いていましたが、朝食のすばらしさにはびっくり。量は多かったですが、とてもきれいで、今日は何にしようかと、楽しかったです。セントラルパークが望め、交通の便もよかったです。ベットも寝心地がよかったです。ロビー脇のお店のハンバーガーもおいしかったです。 37階パークビューに案内されました。部屋はきれい。バスタブあり。アメニティはPeter Thomas　Rothというブランド。チボリオーディオの時計つきラジオ。ipod　DOGなし。このホテルはチェックインに2時間も待たされました。また、SPG　Plutinumであっても部屋のアップグレード以外に朝食、ラウンジなどのサービスは一切ありません。またポッドがない。冷蔵庫はあるが、使い勝手が悪い。（動かすと加算されるみたい。）無料の水すらない。年末カウントダウンのため周りは封鎖されますが、かといってボールドロップが見えるわけでもないので不便です。 Belle vue sur le park. Restaurant plus souvent fermé qu'ouvert ! (excepté pour celui qui ne propose que des hamburgers) Prix de petit déjeuner excessif mais c'est NY !\\nImpossible de prendre un apéro dans le petit bar par manque de place (toutes occupées des heures par des branchés \"internet\" ) pas de service dans le hall.\\nUn hôtel de passage ... sans âme. Hotel tres bien situe, pres de tout, central park, la 5ieme Av. Time square. A notre arriver dans la chambre il y avait un probleme avec la toillette, nous avons appeler et ils sont venu immediatement reparer le tout. A noter, internet est payant a 17$ par jour... je ne comprend pas. Es-ce que je conseille cet hotel, pour affaire dans cette section de la ville oui mais pour loisir non. L'hotel è in una posizione molto strategica per visitare manhattan, le camere non sono grandissime, c'è la vasca ma non la doccia da sola. Le camere sono molto pulite. se possibile fatevi dare la camera dal 20esimo piano in su per una vista migliore. E infine... andate a vedere cosa c'è dietro la tenda a fianco del conciergierie all'ingresso...buonissimo!!! vado spesso a New york per lavoro e non ero mai stato prima al Parker Meridien.\\nNe sono rimasto deluso.\\nIl rapporto qualità-prezzo è assolutamente negativo.\\nle stanze sono piccole e con una strana console centrale nella quale è inserita la televisione che ne riduce ulteriormente lo spazio.\\nIl personale è poco cortese.\\nLa connessione internet costa 16 dollari mentre in un albergo così caro dovrebbe essere gratis.\\nLa posizione è ottima.\\nInsomma, si trovano alberghi migliori ad un prezzo decisamente più conveniente. Mi marido y yo estuvimos alojados en el Parker Meridien una semana durante el mes de agosto. Teníamos reservada una habitación estandar pero cuando llegamos al hotel, un sábado a las 8 de la tarde, nos dijeron que estábamos de suerte porque nos iban a dar una habitación superior a la que teníamos contratada. Nos llevamos una grata sorpresa, la habitación estaba en el piso 25, tenía dos estancias muy amplias, un baño grande... parecía un mini apartamento! Todo limpísimo y muy bonito. El armario era amplio, con dos grandes cajones y se encendia la luz al abrirlo.\\nHe de decir que una de las cosas que más nos gustó fue lo bien que se descansaba, la cama era enorme y comodísima, había mucho silencio y se dormía fenomenal.\\nLas instalaciones del hotel son muy bonitas. El hall es precioso. Los ascensores, muy lujosos, con una pantalla plana en el interior en la que no paran de proyectar películas de Charlotte y Tom y Jerry.\\nEl personal fue muy amable en todo momento. Un día necesité un adaptador para la luz y me dieron varios para probar porque los primeros que me dieron no eran compatibles con mi cámara de fotos. \\nEn la habitación había dos paraguas. No obstante, teníamos concertada una excursión a Washington y la mañana que fuimos llovía mucho, no habíamos cogido los paraguas y los recepcionistas nos facilitaron dos muy amablemente.\\nRespecto a la ubicación, inmejorable. Puedes ir andando a muchos sitios, da la sensación de estar cerca de todo.\\nNo llegamos a subir a la piscina ni visitamos la hamburguesería.\\nEn resumen, una excelente elección. Se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. 10月に2日間滞在しました。部屋からセントラルパークが見え、昼間はとてもきれいでしたが、夜は真っ暗でした。ニューヨークのホテルの割には部屋は広めです。ただ、入り口が工事中で、これが高級ホテル？という感じでした。最上階にプールがあるので、これに期待していたのですが、プールというより、水遊びをする場という感じでした。子連れの親子が遊んでいる感じで、泳いでいる人はいませんでした。10メートルくらいの大きさです。\\nただ、ここからみるセントラルパークは素晴らしかったです。ロケーションは抜群です。\\nアメリカのホテルなのに、コーヒーポットの備え付けがなく、不便でしたので、デパートで買いました。日本と同じ2口のものでしたが、日本に持って帰ったら、微妙に違っていて使えませんでした。\\nちなみに、ポットの貸し出しを聞いたら、ルームサービスで、お湯を頼むしかないと言われました。宿泊料が高い割にいまひとつのホテルでした。 Abbiamo avuto il piacere di soggiornare in quest Hotel fantastico. Cortesia, pulizia e comodità oltre al fatto che ha una posizione invidiabile. Avevamo la camera con vista mozafiato sul Central Park. In due minuti sulla 5th Avenue in 10 minuti nel cuore di Times Square. Ritorneremo con molto piacere. Hotel zeichnet sich durch seine Lage- Central Park/ Times Square 10 Min- aus. Stock 25 war früher Raucherbereich und riecht man immer noch. Zimmer ab Stockwerk 28 mit Parkview zu empfehlen, wenn auch höherer Preis. Frühstück Menue grosse Auswahl aber saftige Preise, Bedienung freundlich u. bemüht. Reception teilweise überfordert u. unterschiedlich qualifiziert. Ho trovato ottimo quest'albergo. Fra tutti quelli che ho frequentato a NY ha sicuramente le stanze più grandi. I concierges sono molto bravi e esaudiscono ogni richiesta.\\nLa posizione è ottima per visitare al meglio Manhattan.\\nE' un po' caro, ma negli standard di NY.... sempre molto cara. \\nNon fate colazione in albergo: potreste pagare 30 dollari per un caffè e due croissants! Hôtel très bien situé géographiquement\\nAmbiance feutrée.\\nPersonnel très accueillant et serviable. hola queria expresar mi opinion pq veo que hay mucha gente que se pasa criticando los hoteles por cositas de nada y van buscando pequeños errores para criticar todos los sitios que han estado. Por cual de esta gente casi cambio de hotel y me hubiese arrepentido toda mi vida pq me hubiera jodido toda mi luna de miel ya que el cambio que estuve apunto de hacer me habria salido peor . Gracias que elegi este hotel.\\nEste hotel lo tiene todo para disfrutar de tus vacaciones en nyc buen servicio, muy limpio, buenas instalaciones(incluida la piscina), muy buenas habitaciones( la cama grande y comodisima), muy bien situado y encima tienes las mejores hamburguesas de todo nyc en la recepcion. certes bien placé pour visiter N.Y mais il vaut mieux réserver un hotel 3 *, les chambres ne sont pas grandes contrairement à ce que l'on pourrait penser en voyant les photos, seul le hall est \"tape à l'oeil\" , les petits dej excessifs (17 dol), quant à la piscine nous n'avons pas eu le temps d'y aller !! Sie finden im Le Parker Meridien Hotel in New York ein ideales Hotel als Ausgangspunkt fuer Ihre Sightseeing Tour.\\nAllerdings hat es einen sehr teuren Preis fuer eine durchschnittliche Leistung.\\nFuer den gleichen Preis gibt es wesentlich bessere Hotels. Wir hatten mehr erwartet, was die Zimmerausstattung und das Ambiente betrifft.\\nSehr schoen ist der Pool im 42. Stock mit hervorragender Aussicht. Ich fand nicht nur die Lage des Parker Meridien großartig, um die Ecke des Central Parks sondern auch daß es für New Yorker Maßstab große Zimmer hat. Meisten verbirgt sich hinter der Zimmertür ja ein Bett, neben dem kein Platz mehr für die Reisetasche ist. Hier was das anders. Das Zimmer war geräumig und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Das Hotelteam war nett und zuvorkommed. Im obersten Stockwerk gib es ein Schwimmbad und eine Aussichtsplatform von der man eine tolle Sicht hat. Ich würde hier jederzeit wieder absteigen! Hotel elegante in ottima posizione per shopping e visite alla città. Personale disponibile, camere ampie ed essenziali per il soggiorno. Absolut zentral gelegen, am Central Park, 10 min zu Fuß zum Times square, Schwimmbad im Haus, für 60 $ nach JFK und Newark. U-Bahn vor der Tür und (für NYC) akzeptable Preise. Zimmer mit Parkblick sind für 40$ pro Nacht buchbar. Der Roomservice ( wie so oft) recht teuer. Zum frühstücken geht am am besten um die Ecke in ein deli. Wir waren bereits zum zweiten mal dort und werden beim nächsten NYC Trip wieder dort absteigen. Tolle Betten, ich war schon 5mal da. Es ist immer wieder angenehm, nicht billig aber \\nangenehmes Hotel. Außer die Aufzüge, meistens gehen nur 2 von 3. Da wenn man ein\\nStockwerk weit oben bewohnt, ist es nervig. Frühstück ist immer extra, sehr gehobener Preis. \\nDer Check in ist immer mit Wartezeit verbunden. Wir waren als größere private Reisegruppe - vier Erwachsene, drei kleine Kinder - in New York. Das Hotel ist für diese Zielgruppe sehr gut geeignet, auch wegen der kurzen Wege zum Central Park, weiteren Attraktionen sowie zur U-Bahn. Hautattraktion für unsere Kinder war der schöne Pool auf dem Dachgeschoss des Hotels mit Blick über die Stadt, den man auch von einer Dachterrasse genießen kann. In den Zimmern hatte alles mit der Vorbereitung (z.B. Kinderwiege) geklappt. Im Erdgeschoss lockt insbesondere eine sehr schöne, szenige Kaffeebar. Wir werden auf jeden Fall bei unserem nächsten NYC-Aufenthalt in dieses Hotel gehen. Le Parker Meridien a un avantage indéniable : une position idéale au coeur de Manhattan, à proximité de nombreux centres d'intérêt (musée, restaurants, shopping, Central Park, 5th Avenue...). C'est un bon hôtel, le lobby est agréable, la piscine avec vue panoramique sur Central Park est très sympa et appréciable pour se rafraîchir après une longue journée. Le petit restaurant Burger Joint, caché dans le lobby, est décalé et mérite sa réputation de meilleur burger de NYC. \\nNotre chambre était spacieuse, avec une superbe vue sur Central Park, magique ! \\nAménagement assez basique, voire manquant quelque peu de modernité, mais suffisant.\\nOn peut regretter simplement, pour un hôtel 4 étoiles, l'absence de peignoir et mules dans les salles de bains. Autres bémols : salle de sport payant, wifi payant dans les chambres.\\nUn bon hôtel de chaine en somme, dont je garderai un bon souvenir. Für alle die mit Familie reisen sowohl von der Lage, den Fazilitäten, dem Service und den Mitarbeitern gesehen eine Top-Adresse auf höchstem Niveau. Klasse und Stil verbinden sich mit einer für diese Metropole fast familiären Atmosphäre. Besonders zu erwähnen ist die fantastische Chef-Concierge Frau Maria Bortoluzzi, deren Kompetenz und Freundlichkeit herausragend ist. Bereits zum zweiten Mal wählte ich dieses Hotel als Ausgangspunkt für die Erkundung New Yorks. Die Lage ist wirklich ideal wenn man nicht unbedingt am lautesten Platz New Yorks nächtigen möchte - das Hotel liegt in Midtown. \\nVom Hotel aus hat man zum Central Park einen Fußweg von ca. 5 und zum Times Square von 10 Minuten. Zwei Ubahnstationen liegen nahezu um die Ecke. \\nDas Hotel zeichnet sich durch nettes Personal und saubere Zimmer aus. Der Service ist genauso wie man es sich von einem Hotel der Meridien-Kette wünscht. Was ich persönlich nicht so toll fand war der Fitness-Bereich. Da es ein \"öffentlicher\" Fitnessclub im Basement des Gebäudes ist muss man selbst als Hotelgast dafür extra bezahlen. \\nUm sportlich fit zu bleiben empfehle ich jedem den hauseigenen Pool auf dem Dach des Buildings - der ist nämlich kostenlos. Von dort aus hat man übrigens auch einen wunderschönen Blick über die Dächer New Yorks. \\nSehr zu empfehlen ist auch das \"Burger\"-Restaurant im Hotel - ein absoluter Geheimtipp, der es mittlerweile sogar in Reiseführer geschafft hat. Todo bien , me gusto mucho el Hotel . \\nLo unico malo es que pague por una habitacion con vista al Central Park , y me dieron una habitacion con vista contraria . \\nNo es lo que me ofrecieron , ni es lo que yo pague . \\nAscensores MUY LENTOS Hallo,\\ndas Hotel Le Parker in New York City war sein Geld wert! Es liegt sehr zentral, fast unmittelbar am Central Park und kann getrost als First Class Hotel bewertet werden - lässt es sich aber auch bezahlen. \\nWir haben beispielsweise auf das angebotene Frühstück verzichtet, da es exorbitant teuer war und man im Starbucks, o.ä. genauso gut etwas zu sich nehmen kann!\\nDas Hotel bietet ein unvergleichliches Extra: es besitzt einen Penthouse Pool, von dem aus man einen herlichen Blick über den Centralpark genießen kann. Er ist nicht der größte seiner Art, aber sehr sehr schön.\\nAbstriche muss man beim Komfort der Aufzüge und Hotelflure machen, die waren rel eng, dunkel und nicht wirklich super gepflegt!\\nDie angestellten hingegen waren nett und die Zimmer waren modern und sauber!\\nAlles in allem eine nicht gerade günstige, aber doch empfehlenswerte Bleibe für einen Trip in die Stadt die wirklich niemals schläft!!! Il a fallu insister pour passer du 6ème étage (glauque, sans aucune vue, bruyant, au dessus des moteurs de climatisation) au 41ème étage, mais ça a été possible.\\nPas grand chose à dire d'autre, là haut c'est évidemment très bien...\\nLa pîscine au 42ème pas mal non plus, même si horriblement chlorée, et à l'équipement un peu cheap (schampoing non remplacé, balance déglinguée, etc...)\\nHall très vivant, bons hamburgers (chers quand même) servis dans une sorte d'antre bien cachée... Bon quartier, ... Quelque francophone fort utile... Wir waren Christmas 2009 5 Tage in New York City. Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut, Nähe des Central Park. Man kann viele Sehenswürdigkeiten und Geschäfte zu Fuß erreichen. Das Hotel ist sauber, die Zimmer gut ausgestattet und verhältnismäßig groß. Das Frühstück im Hotelrestaurant Normas allerdings viel zu teuer und nicht besonders. 8 nuits au Parker Méridien : idéal pour tous les déplacements des touristes que nous sommes! à 2 blocks de CPark, 10 de Times Square... merveille des merveille : la vue du rooftop, magnifique! des transats à disposition pour prendre ses petits déj (achetés au starbuck d'en face) ou boire un coca après une journée épuisante. Piscine agréable avec vue sur les building\\nmais mais...pas de coffee maker dans les chambres, dur dur le matin...\\nsuite junior pour 4? décoration soignée mais où sont les placards de rangement?\\npetit déj au Norma : chiquissime mais cherissime!! (délicieux néanmoins)\\nenfin un bar top sans oublier une équipe de concierge adorable & plein de bons conseils Arredamento moderno pulito, centralissimo e con un centro fitness incredibile.\\nLo consiglio assolutamente !!!!! 久しぶりにビジネスで訪れたＮＹで宿泊したホテル。セントラルパークに近い、ミッドタウンに位置して、街歩きには何かと便利なロケーションです。プライベートの自由時間が限られる中、効率的に必要なものを手に入れたり、実際に歩き回るために書き出したto-doリストをもとに、ホテルのコンセルジェに相談すると、明快かつプラスアルファの回答を出してくれ、見事に120％目標達成できました。 Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre semaine dans cet hôtel, nous ne regrettons qu'une\\nchose, et c'est toujours pareil dans cette catégorie d'hôtel, malgré un prix très élevé pour\\nles chambres, il faut encore ajouter des frais pour Internet, c'est incroyable!!!\\nNous n'arrivons pas à comprendre.... NYCらしい装飾を抑えたシックなホテルですが、スタッフのサービスもよいです。\\nなにより、適度な高級感のあるホテルで、バックステージのようにカーテンの裏に隠れたハンバーガー店がおすすめです。\\nオーダーの仕方は、まず焼き方と中身を伝えてから、自分の名前を伝えます。出来上がった時に名前をよばれます。（たまにナンパ目的で２度呼ばれたりして）\\nおすすめは\"meduium rare\" と\"eveything\"。肉汁がいっぱいのハンバーガーです。ポテトもおいしいです。（ナンパ目的で貰いました）\\nセントラルパークを望めるParkViewのお部屋は、立地上数部屋しかないようですが、ハネムーナーが前もって予約をしていた部屋を拝見させてもらったところ、都会の中で緑がまぶしい、とてもいいお部屋でした。\\n日本のミュージシャンもお一人でお泊まりされていたのをみかけましたよ。 Estuvimos en él a mediados de agosto de 2010. Lo elegimos por la recomendación que nos hicieron desde El Corte Inglés, y pagamos una diferencia importante con respecto a otros hoteles como el Intercontinental. Escogimos esta opción pensando que sin estar en medio de Times Square ni otras atracciones turísticas y estando cerca de Central Park, su ubicación disfrutaría de una zona poco ruidosa. sin embargo, el hotel no cubrió nuestras expectativas. La tarde que entramos solicitamos que nos cambiaran hasta tres veces de habitación por el ruido. Al final nos dieron una habitación en uno de los pisos superiores y bueno, ni tan mal. pero el ruido es una de sus características principales, no sólo el exterior (ventanas sin insonorizar), sino el provocado por el sistema de ventilación interno. pensamos que hoteles de esta categoría deberían estar preparados para poder dormir mejor después de intensas jornadas a pie, pero bueno era nuestra primera visita a Nueva York y no sabemos si existen remansos se paz a tal efecto en la Gran Manzana. Por lo demás, el hotel era correcto. por cierto nos atendió en castellano Rafael en la recepción, todo amabilidad y cordialidad. Hay otros conserjes que son un poco cardos, sobre todo si no hablas un inglés acorde al que esperan sus excelencias. la piscina está muy bien y tiene un gran servicio de personal. las habitaciones también están bien, sin grandes alardes, pero correctas. abajo tiene un lugar en el que dicen servir las mejores hamburguesas de Nueva York. estando buenas, tampoco son la octava maravilla del mundo, pero están bien. Pagamos alrededor de 40 dólares para dos personas si no recuerdo mal. Si puedes, huye como alma que lleva el diablo del 'Centro de Negocios' para meterte a internet. por tema profesional, tuve que utilizar durante media hora el servicio y me cobraron 50 dólares. un abuso, pero esto es New York, amigos. también nos sentó muy mal que al regreso, el hotel nos incluyó en la relación de gastos de la tarjeta de crédito una cantidad al hacer el check in (200 dólares más o menos). al parecer lo hacen como hábito, por seguridad o lo que sea y no nos lo cobraron finalmente. algo increíble porque nosotros ya habíamos pagado el viaje al Corte Inglés. también hicimos un circuito con esta compañía de cuatro días de duración a Niagara, Toronto, Washington y Philadelphia. Un auténtico sacadineros porque aún teniendo pagado todo, los del circuito te cobran por todo tipo de excursiones inventadas. no nos gustó el estilo. Aunque el guía era sabía mucho, era bastante pesado y quería sacarte pasta por todos lados. Además terminaron pidiéndonos propinas. Muy feo, a pesar de que esta sociedad se mueva con este sistema 'propineril'. Un saludo y feliz estancia en Nueva York. Pase lo que pase, el viaje siempre merece la pena. Albergo di grandi dimensioni e con un numero di presenze rilevante, non ci si deve aspettare di essere coccolati dal personale perchè le dimensioni non lo consentono; ottima posizione per muoversi in autonomia a Manhattan. ここの朝食は優雅に時間をかけて食べるのをお勧め。セットメニューが２０種類以上から選べて、内容も素晴らしい。朝から優雅な気分になれるでしょう。フロントスタッフも親切で丁寧。ポーターも申し分なく、ビジネスで優雅に過ごしたいならここのホテルがお勧めです。 Pour quoi pas une petite folie?\\nLe Parker Méridien est situé tout proche de Central Park et de la 5eme avenue.\\nLa particularité qui vaut le détour: la piscine couverte sur le toit avec une vue panoramique sur central park!\\nSinon, chambre très confortable, room service efficace mais cher, bar design... Certes cet hôtel est bien placé (tout près de Central Park) et la vue de certaines chambres est très agréable, mais là s'arrêtent les points positifs. Nous avions réservé 2 chambres, nous avons eu la 1ère à 15h et la 2ème à 22h, c'est long quand on a voyagé et que l'on a 6 heures de décalage horaire ! Le service est inexistant, le petit déjeuner est hors de prix pour la qualité. Quant à la piscine, nous n'avons pas eu nous y tremper, elle était envahie par un groupe d'enfants qui semblait venir d'un \"centre aéré\" de la banlieue new-yorkaise. Das Hotel is masslos ueberbewertet - auf keinen Fall ein 5 Sterne Haus. Misserable Zimmer in der Deluxe Category, triple Bett war ein Feldbett, die Zimmergroesse max 10 qm, das Badezimmer alt und grau. Nach Protest wurde uns ein neues ZImmer zugewiesen, etwas groesser, aber das triple Bett war wieder ein Felbett. Noch nochmaligen Protest haben wir dann ein akzeptables Zimmer bekommen, aber erst nachdem wir mir dem Manger on Duty gesprochen haben. Das Hotel ist gelinde gesagt als 5 Sterne Hause eine Zumutung. Qualité du lit d'appoint insuffisante dans la suite junior  "
